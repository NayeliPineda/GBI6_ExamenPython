AB  - Oleaginous fungi natively accumulate large amounts of triacylglycerides (TAG),widely used as precursors for sustainable biodiesel production. However, littleattention has been paid to the diversity and roles of fungal mixed microbialcultures (MMCs) in sequencing batch reactors (SBR). In this study, a lipid-richstream produced in the fish-canning industry was used as a substrate in twolaboratory-scale SBRs operated under the feast/famine (F/F) regime to enrichmicroorganisms with high TAG-storage ability, under two different concentrations of NaCl (SBR-N: 0.5g/L; SBR-S: 10g/L). The size of the fungal community in theenriched activated sludge (EAS) was analyzed using 18S rRNA-based qPCR, and thefungal community structure was determined by Illumina sequencing. The differentselective pressures (feeding strategy and control of pH) implemented in theenrichment SBRs throughout operation increased the abundance of total fungi. Ingeneral, there was an enrichment of genera previously identified asTAG-accumulating fungi (Apiotrichum, Candida, Cutaneotrichosporon, Geotrichum,Haglerozyma, Metarhizium, Mortierella, Saccharomycopsis, and Yarrowia) in bothSBRs. However, the observed increase of their relative abundances throughoutoperation was not significantly linked to a higher TAG accumulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe effectiveness of mRNA vaccines by comparing 2-dose (2D)and 3-dose (3D) healthcare worker (HCW) recipients in the setting of Omicronvariant dominance. Performance of 2D and 3D vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2variants and the clinical outcomes of HCWs may inform return-to-work guidance.METHODS: In a retrospective study from December 15, 2020 - January 15, 2022, SARSCoV-2 infections among HCWs at a large tertiary cancer center in New York City(NYC) were examined to estimate infection rates over the omicron period(aggregated positive tests/person-days) and 95% CIs in 2D and 3D mRNA vaccinated HCWs and were compared using rate ratios. We describe the clinical features ofpost-vaccine infections and impact of prior (pre-Omicron) COVID infection onvaccine effectiveness (VE). RESULTS: Among the 20,857 HCWs in our cohort, 20,660 completed the 2D series with an mRNA vaccine during our study period and 12,461had received a third dose by January 15, 2022. The infection rate ratio for 2Dvs. 3D vaccinated HCWs was 0.667 (95% CI 0.623, 0.713) for an estimated 3D VE of 33.2% compared to 2 doses only during the Omicron dominant period from 12/15/21- 1/15/22. Breakthrough (BT) Omicron infections after 3D + 14 days occurred in 1315HCWs. Omicron infections were mild, with 16% of 3D and 11% 2D HCWs beingasymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Study demonstrates improved vaccine-derived protectionagainst COVID-19 infection in 3D vs. 2D mRNA vaccinees during the Omicron surge. The advantage of 3D vaccination was maintained irrespective of prior COVID-19infection status.

AB  - Focused ultrasonic ablation surgery (FUAS) for tumor treatment has emerged as an effective non-invasive therapeutic approach, but its widespread clinicalutilization is limited by its low therapeutic efficiency caused by inadequatetumor targeting, single imaging modality, and possible tumor recurrence followingsurgery. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a biological targetingsynergistic system consisting of genetically engineered bacteria andmulti-functional nanoparticles to overcome these limitations. Escherichia coliwas genetically modified to carry an acoustic reporter gene encoding theformation of gas vesicles (GVs) and then target the tumor hypoxic environment in mice. After E. coli producing GVs (GVs-E. coli) colonized the tumor target area, ultrasound imaging and collaborative FUAS were performed; multi-functionalnanoparticles were then enriched in the tumor target area through electrostaticadsorption. Multi-functional cationic lipid nanoparticles containing IR780,perfluorohexane, and banoxantrone dihydrochloride (AQ4N) were coloaded in thetumor to realize targeted multimodal imaging and enhance the curative effect ofFUAS. AQ4N was stimulated by the tumor hypoxic environment and synergisticallycooperated with FUAS to kill tumor cells. In sum, synergistic tumor therapyinvolving multi-functional nanoparticles mediated by genetically engineeredbacteria overcomes the limitations and improves the curative effect of existingFUAS. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Inadequate tumor targeting, single imagemonitoring mode, and prone tumor recurrence following surgery remain significant challenges yet critical for tumor therapy. This study proposes a strategy forgenetically engineered bacteria-mediated multifunctional nanoparticles forsynergistic tumor therapy. The multifunctional genetically engineered biological targeting synergistic agent can accomplish tumor-targeting therapy, synergisticFUAS ablation, hypoxia-activated chemotherapy combined with FUAS ablation, andmultiple-imaging guidance and monitoring all at the same time, therebycompensating for the shortcomings of FUAS treatment. This strategy could pave theway for the progress of tumor therapy.

AB  - Soil microorganisms are biological factors involved in the farmland environment. The factors that shape soil microbial communities and how these are influenced bygeographic location, planting pattern (open-field or greenhouse), and soilorganic pollutants (phthalate esters, PAEs) remain poorly understood at largescales. Using 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing, we characterized the soilmicrobiota in open-field and greenhouse soils in Hebei Province, China, andcorrelated their structure and composition to geographic location, plantingpattern and PAEs. Compared with geographic location, planting pattern is moredecisive for shaping soil microbes and has more significant effects on bacteria, and the effects are shaped by the number and types of core OTUs. PAEsparticipated in the shaping of soil microbial communities by altering therelative abundances of dominant microorganisms in the two planting patterns, and the effects of PAEs with high Kow were more significant. PAEs have a greaterimpact on bacteria than fungi in both planting patterns. Bacteria in thegreenhouse soil were sensitive to the 9 kinds of PAEs detected, however in theopen-field samples, mainly responded to PAEs with high Kow and rarely respond to PAEs with low Kow. DEHP and DBP, as two monomers with the highest concentration, have significant effects on dominant genera of microorganisms under both plantingpatterns, with inhibiting effect on bacteria and significantly promotion onfungi. Our study clarified the factors that have a substantial impact on soilmicroorganisms at the provincial scale and the mechanisms involved in shapingsoil microbial community structure, as well as the significant impact of PAEs on soil microbial dominant microorganisms.

AB  - In this work, the physiological roles of the primary peroxide scavengingactivities of Enterococcus faecium AUS0004 strain were analysed. Thishealthcare-associated pathogen harbours genes encoding putative NADH peroxidase(Npr), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpCF), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) andmanganese-dependent catalase (Mn-Kat). Gene expression analyses showed that nprand kat genes are especially and significantly induced in cells treated withhydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH), which suggested animportant function of these enzymes to protect E. faecium against peroxidestress. Mutants affected in one or several predicted anti-oxidative activitiesmentioned above showed that neither the peroxidases nor the catalase areimplicated in the defence against peroxide challenges. However, ourinvestigations allowed us to show that Npr is responsible for the degradation of approximately 45% of metabolically derived H2O2 which avoids accumulation of the peroxide to lethal concentrations.

AB  - With the help of the establishment of novel reaction methodology, a series ofN-Aryl-5-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-1,5- dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one conjugates weredesigned and synthesized in 2-4 steps, and subsequent anticancer activity ofthese compounds was evaluated. Preliminary results showed that these compoundshave moderate to potent activities against human acute leukemia cells K562, humanlung cancer A549, human breast cancer MDA-MB-231, and human cervical cancer HeLa cancer cell lines. Among them, compounds 2d and 2k were the most potent againstK562 cell line with IC50 values of 0.07 and 0.52 microM, respectively, and thetoxicity of 2d to the normal of hepatocytes (LO2) cell line was low (the survivalrate 81%). Flow cytometry analysis showed that 2d arrested K562 cells in the G2/Mphase potently, even much better than Combretastatin A4 (CA4). In addition, theresults demonstrated the involvement of the caspase-dependent or independentpathways of apoptosis, evidenced by the upregulation of FADD, pro-caspase 3,cleaved-caspase 3, HTRA2/Omi, SMAC/Diablo and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2.Thebiological effects founding of 2d in this work point to prospective uses against acute leukemia.

AB  - Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is a well-studied icosahedral plant virus that has attractive properties for nanoscience applications. Stable empty particlesdevoid of viral genomic RNA have historically been generated from virions by: 1. high pressure; 2. extreme alkaline pH; and 3. freeze-thaw using liquid nitrogen. Herein we report a fourth and more convenient avenue for empty particle formationthrough EDTA treatment, implicating chelation of virion-associated cations. Wepresent findings that confirm TYMV virions purified in an EDTA-based buffer areconverted to 94% empty on average during purification. Additional experimentationrevealed TYMV virions purified through CsCl vs. sucrose gradients are morereadily converted to empty particles after freeze thaw. These studies are novelas they show a purification method through EDTA-treatment that can generatestable empty particles devoid of viral genome. The convenience of this methodshould prove suitable for scientists seeking to use TYMV capsids innanoscience-inspired applications. Importantly, these findings provide insightinto historical discrepancies in creating empty particles after freeze-thaw, asthe method in which TYMV virions are purified influences the downstreamvirion-to-empty conversion process.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis is a disease with a worldwide prevalence that is caused byToxoplasma gondii. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are two pharmacological agents commonly used to treat of this infection. However, they are accompanied by someside effects. Therefore, the identifying of new drugs with low toxocytosis seems to be a matter of vital importance. Quinolones are DNA replication inhibitors,exerting inhibitory effects against many pathogens, including bacteria,mycoplasma, and protozoa. Given the importance of quinolones and their efficacy, the present in vitro study was conducted to investigate the antiparasiticactivities of new quinolones (NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6) containing nitrofuranmoiety against T. gondii. To this end, Vero cells were incubated with variousconcentrations of new quinolones and pyrimethamine (positive control) todetermine their viability. Subsequently, they were infected with T. gondii (RHstrain) and then subjected to drug treatment. The obtained IC50 values were 3.60,4.84, 5.59, 3.44 and 2.75mug/mL for NFQ-2, NFQ-5, NFQ-6, ciprofloxacin andpyrimethamine, respectively. The CC50 values for the NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6 were25.20, 29.89, and 28.43mug/mL, indicating the selectivity indexes more than 5 forthese compounds. The anti-Toxoplasma efficiency was determined by evaluatinginfection index, number and size of plaques, and T. gondii intracellularproliferation. As the results indicated, the administration of new quinolonederivatives resulted in the reduction of intracellular proliferation, infectionindex, and the number and size of plaques in comparison to uninfected treatedcells (P<0.05). The results were indicative of a considerable synergetic effectwhen each of the derivatives was used in combination with pyrimethamine, comparedto when used alone. Based on our results, the nitrofuran-derived quinolones canbe considered as new leads for the design of new anti-Toxoplasma agents.

AB  - Bacterial communities in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) were characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flightmass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to identify HPC isolates and the obtainedresults were compared to 16S rRNA (V4) metabarcoding data acquired in a previous study. Sixty-three samples were collected at nine stages of the potabilizationprocess: river water and groundwater intake, decantation, sand filtration,ozonization, carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, the mixing chamber andpost-chlorination drinking water. In total, 1807 bacterial colonies wereisolated, 32% of which were successfully identified to at least the genus levelby MALDI-TOF MS using our previously developed Drinking Water Library. Trends in diversity were similar by both approaches, but differences were observed in thedetection of taxa, especially at lower hierarchy levels. High bacterial diversitywas observed in river and groundwater, where Proteobacteria predominated. Thediversity decreased significantly after the chlorination step, where Bacillus sp.(Firmicutes) and an unknown genus of Obscuribacteraceae (Cyanobacteria) were the most prevalent genera according to MALDI-TOF MS and metabarcoding, respectively. The two approaches gave similar results for the decantation, sand filtration and mixing chamber steps, where the most abundant taxon was Flavobacterium. Thecombined use of these culture-based and culture-independent methods tocharacterize microbial populations may help to better understand the role ofbacteria in water treatment and quality, which will be of value for DWTPmanagement.

AB  - Favipiravir (T-705, 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) selectively andstrongly inhibits the replication of influenza virus in vitro and in vivo.Favipiravir is converted to favipiravir-4-ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate(favipiravir RTP) by intracellular enzymes and functions as a nucleotide analogto selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of influenza virus.Our previous experiments failed in an attempt to obtain a favipiravir-resistantinfluenza virus in vitro using influenza virus A/PR/8/34(H1N1). Conversely,Goldhill et al. reported a favipiravir-resistant influenza virus generated by in vitro passage of influenza virus A/England/195/2009 (H1N1), an early isolate fromthe 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pdm09), in the presence of favipiravir with K229Rmutation in PB1. This study focused on K229R mutation near the NTP cross-linkedregion in PB1 based on the above conflicting findings to confirm whether K229Rmutation brings favipiravir resistance to influenza virus A/PR/8/34. Thirty PB1mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the NTP cross-linked regionwere evaluated using an influenza virus A/PR/8/34 replicon system. Among the 30mutants, 10 possessed but 20 lost replicon activity. When susceptibility tofavipiravir in 10 mutants was further assessed, the PB1 E491D mutant was fivetimes more sensitive than the wild-type (WT), while only the PB1 K229R mutant wasresistant to favipiravir. Results suggested that the evaluated region wasessential for polymerase activity, and K229 mutation was responsible forpolymerase inhibition of favipiravir in the influenza virus A/PR/8/34.Interestingly, the tested K229X series mutants entirely lost replicon activity,except for K229R. This suggested that the amino acid at position 229 in PB1 ofinfluenza virus may play a pivotal role in polymerase activity. Moreover, thislysine residue is highly conserved among positive- and negative-sensesingle-stranded RNA viruses, in which favipiravir showed potent activity,suggesting that this mutation may determine the characterization of the in vitro broad-spectrum activity of favipiravir. Additionally, this mutation acquisitiongreatly influences the viral replication and the susceptibility to favipiravir.

AB  - 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmentalcontaminant that induces diverse biological and toxic effects, includingreprogramming intermediate metabolism, mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). However, the specific reprogramming effects of TCDD are unclear. Here, we performed targeted LC-MS analysis of hepatic extracts from mice gavaged withTCDD. We detected an increase in S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine, a conjugate from the spontaneous reaction between the cysteine sulfhydryl group and highlyreactive acrylyl-CoA, an intermediate in the cobalamin (Cbl)-independentbeta-oxidation-like metabolism of propionyl-CoA. TCDD repressed genes in both thecanonical Cbl-dependent carboxylase and the alternate Cbl-independentbeta-oxidation-like pathways as well as inhibited methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) at lower doses. Moreover, TCDD decreased serum Cbl levels and hepatic cobaltlevels while eliciting negligible effects on gene expression associated with Cbl absorption, transport, trafficking, or derivatization to5'-deoxy-adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), the required MUT cofactor. Additionally,TCDD induced the gene encoding aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1), the enzymeresponsible for decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconate, anddose-dependently increased itaconate levels in hepatic extracts. Our resultsindicate MUT inhibition is consistent with itaconate activation to itaconyl-CoA, a MUT suicide inactivator that forms an adduct with AdoCbl. This adduct in turninhibits MUT activity and reduces Cbl levels. Collectively, these results suggestthe decrease in MUT activity is due to Cbl depletion following TCDD treatment,which redirects propionyl-CoA metabolism to the alternate Cbl-independentbeta-oxidation-like pathway. The resulting hepatic accumulation of acrylyl-CoAlikely contributes to TCDD-elicited hepatotoxicity and the multi-hit progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis.

AB  - Natural products constitute and significantly impact many current anti-cancermedical interventions. A subset of natural products induces injury processes inmalignant cells that recruit and activate host immune cells to produce anadaptive anti-cancer immune response, a process known as immunogenic cell death. However, a challenge in the field is to delineate forms of cell death and injury that best promote durable antitumor immunity. Addressing this with a single-cell chemical biology natural product discovery platform, like multiplex activitymetabolomics, would be especially valuable in human leukemia, where cancer cells are heterogeneous and may react differently to the same compounds. Herein, a new ten-color, fluorescent cell barcoding-compatible module measuring six immunogeniccell injury signaling readouts: DNA damage response (gammaH2AX), apoptosis(cCAS3), necroptosis (p-MLKL), mitosis (p-Histone H3), autophagy (LC3), and theunfolded protein response (p-EIF2alpha). A proof-of-concept screen was performed to validate functional changes in single cells induced by secondary metaboliteswith known mechanisms within bacterial extracts. This assay was then applied inmultiplexed activity metabolomics to reveal an unexpected mammalian cell injuryprofile induced by the natural product narbomycin. Finally, the functionalconsequences of injury pathways on immunogenicity were compared with threecanonical assays for immunogenic hallmarks, ATP, HMGB1, and calreticulin, tocorrelate secondary metabolite-induced cell injury profiles with canonicalmarkers of immunogenic cell death. In total, this work demonstrated a newphenotypic screen for discovery of natural products that modulate injury responsepathways that can contribute to cancer immunogenicity.

AB  - The obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis obtain all nutrientsfrom the cytoplasm of their epithelial host cells and stimulate glucose uptake bythese cells. They even hijack host ATP, exerting a strong metabolic pressure ontheir host at the peak of the proliferative stage of their developmental cycle.However, it is largely unknown whether infection modulates the metabolism of the host cell. Also, the reliance of the bacteria on host metabolism might changeduring their progression through their biphasic developmental cycle. Herein,using primary epithelial cells and two cell lines of non-tumoral origin, weshowed that between the two main ATP-producing pathways of the host, oxidativephosphorylation (OxPhos) remained stable and glycolysis was slightly increased.Inhibition of either pathway strongly reduced bacterial proliferation,implicating that optimal bacterial growth required both pathways to function atfull capacity. While we found C. trachomatis displayed some degree of energeticautonomy in the synthesis of proteins expressed at the onset of infection,functional host glycolysis was necessary for the establishment of earlyinclusions, whereas OxPhos contributed less. These observations correlated withthe relative contributions of the pathways in maintaining ATP levels inepithelial cells, with glycolysis contributing the most. Altogether, this workhighlights the dependence of C. trachomatis on both host glycolysis and OxPhosfor efficient bacterial replication. However, ATP consumption appears atequilibrium with the normal production capacity of the host and the bacteria, so that no major shift between these pathways is required to meet bacterial needs.

AB  - Brain macrophage populations include parenchymal microglia, border-associatedmacrophages, and recruited monocyte-derived cells; together, they control braindevelopment and homeostasis but are also implicated in aging pathogenesis andneurodegeneration. The phenotypes, localization, and functions of each populationin different contexts have yet to be resolved. We generated a murine brainmyeloid scRNA-seq integration to systematically delineate brain macrophagepopulations. We show that the previously identified disease-associated microglia (DAM) population detected in murine Alzheimer's disease models actually comprisestwo ontogenetically and functionally distinct cell lineages: embryonicallyderived triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)-dependent DAMexpressing a neuroprotective signature and monocyte-derived TREM2-expressingdisease inflammatory macrophages (DIMs) accumulating in the brain during aging.These two distinct populations appear to also be conserved in the human brain.Herein, we generate an ontogeny-resolved model of brain myeloid cellheterogeneity in development, homeostasis, and disease and identify cellulartargets for the treatment of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Live bacterial therapeutics (LBTs) could reverse diseases by engrafting in thegut and providing persistent beneficial functions in the host. However, attempts to functionally manipulate the gut microbiome of conventionally raised (CR) hostshave been unsuccessful because engineered microbial organisms (i.e., chassis)have difficulty in colonizing the hostile luminal environment. In thisproof-of-concept study, we use native bacteria as chassis for transgene delivery to impact CR host physiology. Native Escherichia coli bacteria isolated from the stool cultures of CR mice were modified to express functional genes. Thereintroduction of these strains induces perpetual engraftment in the intestine.In addition, engineered native E. coli can induce functional changes that affect physiology of and reverse pathology in CR hosts months after administration.Thus, using native bacteria as chassis to "knock in" specific functions allowsmechanistic studies of specific microbial activities in the microbiome of CRhosts and enables LBT with curative intent.

AB  - Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising therapeutic approach formicrobiota-associated pathologies, but our understanding of the post-FMTmicrobiome assembly process and its ecological and clinical determinants isincomplete. Here we perform a comprehensive fecal metagenome analysis of 14 FMTtrials, involving five pathologies and >250 individuals, and determine theorigins of strains in patients after FMT. Independently of the underlyingclinical condition, conspecific coexistence of donor and recipient strains after FMT is uncommon and donor strain engraftment is strongly positively correlatedwith pre-FMT recipient microbiota dysbiosis. Donor strain engraftment wasenhanced through antibiotic pretreatment and bowel lavage and dependent on donor and recipient a-diversity; strains from relatively abundant species were morelikely and from predicted oral, oxygen-tolerant, and gram-positive species lesslikely to engraft. We introduce a general mechanistic framework for post-FMTmicrobiome assembly in alignment with ecological theory, which can guidedevelopment of optimized, more targeted, and personalized FMT therapies.

TI  - Assessment of objective and subjective cognitive function in patients withtreatment-resistant depression undergoing repeated ketamine infusions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subanesthetic ketamine infusions can elicit rapid and sustainedantidepressant effects, yet the potential cognitive impact of ketamine has notbeen thoroughly examined. This study measured changes in objective and subjectivecognitive function following repeated ketamine treatment. METHODS: Thirty-eightpatients with treatment-resistant depression were administered cognitiveassessments before and after undergoing 7 intravenous ketamine infusions (0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) within a clinical trial examining the efficacy of singleand repeated administrations. Depression severity and perceived concentrationwere evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and theQuick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms Self-Report (QIDS-SR16). RESULTS:Twenty-three participants (60.5%) responded after repeated infusions (>/= 50%decrease in MADRS total scores). We measured significant improvements in several cognitive domains including attention, working memory, verbal and visuospatialmemory (effect sizes ranging from Cohen's d = 0.37-0.79). Cognitive changes were attributed to reduction in depressive symptoms except for improvement in verbalmemory which remained significant after adjustment for change in MADRS totalscore (P = .029, etap2 = 0.13). Only responders reported improvement insubjective cognitive function with repeated ketamine administration (MADRS item6, P < .001, d = 2.00; QIDS item 10, P < .001, d = 1.36). CONCLUSION: A shortcourse of repeated ketamine infusions did not impair neurocognitive function inpatients with treatment-resistant depression. Further research is required tounderstand the potential mediating role of response and remission on improvedcognitive function accompanying ketamine treatment as well as to examinelonger-term safety outcomes.

AB  - Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potentially unlimitedresource for cell therapies, but the derivation of mature cell types remainschallenging. The histone methyltransferase EZH1 is a negative regulator oflymphoid potential during embryonic hematopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate that EZH1repression facilitates in vitro differentiation and maturation of T cells fromiPSCs. Coupling a stroma-free T cell differentiation system withEZH1-knockdown-mediated epigenetic reprogramming, we generated iPSC-derived Tcells, termed EZ-T cells, which display a highly diverse T cell receptor (TCR)repertoire and mature molecular signatures similar to those of TCRalphabeta Tcells from peripheral blood. Upon activation, EZ-T cells give rise to effectorand memory T cell subsets. When transduced with chimeric antigen receptors(CARs), EZ-T cells exhibit potent antitumor activities in vitro and in xenograft models. Epigenetic remodeling via EZH1 repression allows efficient production of developmentally mature T cells from iPSCs for applications in adoptive celltherapy.

AB  - Human gut commensals are increasingly suggested to impact non-communicablediseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), yet their targetedsuppression remains a daunting unmet challenge. In four geographically distinctIBD cohorts (n = 537), we identify a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains,featuring a unique antibiotics resistance and mobilome signature, to be strongly associated with disease exacerbation and severity. Transfer of clinicalIBD-associated Kp strains into colitis-prone, germ-free, and colonized miceenhances intestinal inflammation. Stepwise generation of a lytic five-phagecombination, targeting sensitive and resistant IBD-associated Kp clade membersthrough distinct mechanisms, enables effective Kp suppression in colitis-pronemice, driving an attenuated inflammation and disease severity. Proof-of-conceptassessment of Kp-targeting phages in an artificial human gut and in healthyvolunteers demonstrates gastric acid-dependent phage resilience, safety, andviability in the lower gut. Collectively, we demonstrate the feasibility oforally administered combination phage therapy in avoiding resistance, whileeffectively inhibiting non-communicable disease-contributing pathobionts.

AB  - Magnaporthe oryzae infects rice, wheat and other grass crops through appressoria.The formation of the appressorium is regulated by the external environment,signal transduction pathways, and transcription factors. Transcription factorsVrf1 and Hox7 are involved in the regulation of appressorium formation. In thisstudy, we demonstrate that Vrf1 and Hox7 play vital roles in coordinatelyregulating appressorium maturation. In strain 70-15, deletion of VRF1 resulted inthe inability to continue melanization and maturation of the incipientappressorium, and deletion of HOX7 also resulted in defects in appressoriummelanization and maturation. The defects in appressorium formation inDeltahox7Deltavrf1 were similar to those in Deltahox7 and Deltavrf1. The geneexpression profiles of the incipient appressoria at 5 h post-inoculation (hpi)showed that the expression levels of 704 genes (25.94 % of all differentiallyexpressed genes in the three mutants) were significantly downregulated (606genes) or upregulated (98 genes). In the appressoria of Deltahox7, Deltavrf1, andDeltahox7Deltavrf1 at 5 hpi, the expression level of genes related to cell wallremodeling was changed. Genes for melanin synthesis, chitin and glucandegradation, and extracellular cell wall degrading enzyme were significantlydownregulated, while genes for chitin and glucan synthesis were upregulated.After 8 hpi, the incipient appressoria of Deltahox7, Deltavrf1, andDeltahox7Deltavrf1 regerminated and formed swollen hyphal-like structures withmultiple nuclei. The ratio of the nuclear number of the hyphal-like structures ofDeltahox7, Deltahox7Deltavrf1, and Deltavrf1 was close to 6:4:2 at 24 hpi.Therefore, although Vrf1 and Hox7 are somewhat functionally different, theysynergistically regulate appressorium maturation in M. oryzae.

AB  - Bacteria belonging to the genus Achromobacter are widely distributed in naturalenvironments and have been recognized as emerging pathogens for theircontribution to a wide range of human infections. In particular, patients withcystic fibrosis (CF) are the subjects most frequently colonized by Achromobacter spp., which can cause persistent infections in their respiratory tract. Although many clinical aspects and pathogenic mechanisms still remain to be elucidated,Achromobacter spp. have been a source of expanding interest in recent years. Thisreview examines the current literature regarding Achromobacter spp. role in CF,focusing on taxonomy, prevalence in CF lung infections, genomic characteristics, and adaptation strategies including modifications of metabolism and virulence,acquisition of antibiotic resistance, exchange of mobile genetic elements anddevelopment of hypermutation.

AB  - Hydrogels have been used widely as wound dressings for maintaining a moistenvironment to rapid wound healing. However, the lack of antibacterial effectlimits their further applications. Herein, we developed a polysaccharide-basedhydrogel that can achieve photothermal-assisted bacterial inactivation. Thehydrogel has inherent antibacterial activity due to introduction of quaternisedchitosan (QCS) with a protonated amine group-modified hydrophilic polycationicstructure. Under near infrared (NIR) irradiation, the antibacterial effect of thehydrogel was significantly improved because thermal ablation could also combatbacteria. The hydrogel showed self-healing property through reversible Schiffbase bonds between QCS and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA). The hydrogel is alsopH-sensitive to release drugs in acidic wound. The full-thickness skin defectmodel showed it had a promoting effect on wound healing. Overall, we provide atheoretical basis for a promising wound dressing based on a photothermallyimproved polysaccharide-based hydrogel with self-healing/pH-responsive/inherentlyantibacterial capacity.

AB  - Several bacterial and fungal diseases affect greenhouse-grown tomato crops,causing severe annual yield losses worldwide. The need to reduce chemicalcompound applications has encouraged the search of alternative approach for thecontrol of tomato diseases, including the use of biological control agents. Thepresence of total and beneficial microbial populations was investigated on thesurface and in the pulp of seven cultivars of tomato fruit coming from elevengreenhouses in the Pachino district (south-east of Sicily), recognized by theEuropean Community with the "Protected Geographical Indication" label. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that epiphytic and endophytic microbialpopulations clustered into groups according to the areas of origin. Approximately240 tomato fruit-associated bacterial isolates were selected and a highpercentage of them showed antagonistic activity against Clavibacter michiganensissubsp. michiganensis, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. perforans, Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria alternata. Analysis of the 16SrRNA gene sequences revealed a predominance of bacteria in Bacillus andPseudomonas genera, followed by Citrobacter and Enterobacter. The presence ofthese genera differed according to the geographical areas of tomato samples,whereas their antagonistic capabilities varied according to the five tomatopathogens. The in vitro effectiveness of eight representative bacterial strainsbelonging to Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Enterobacter genera was confirmed in invivo assays, carried out on tomato fruit artificially inoculated with A.alternata and B. cinerea. Altogether, these results revealed differences inpopulation density of native microbiota of "Pomodoro di Pachino" fruits andallowed the selection of antagonistic bacterial strains that can be applied infield and in postharvest conditions as alternatives to chemical compounds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autopsy studies have provided valuable insights into thepathophysiology of COVID-19. Controversies remain about whether the clinicalpresentation is due to direct organ damage by SARS-CoV-2 or secondary effects,such as overshooting immune response. SARS-CoV-2 detection in tissues by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM) can help answer these questions, but a comprehensive evaluation of these applications is missing.METHODS: We assessed publications using IHC and EM for SARS-CoV-2 detection inautopsy tissues. We systematically evaluated commercially available antibodiesagainst the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in cultured cell lines and COVID-19 autopsytissues. In a multicentre study, we evaluated specificity, reproducibility, andinter-observer variability of SARS-CoV-2 IHC. We correlated RT-qPCR viral tissue loads with semiquantitative IHC scoring. We used qualitative and quantitative EM analyses to refine criteria for ultrastructural identification of SARS-CoV-2.FINDINGS: Publications show high variability in detection and interpretation ofSARS-CoV-2 abundance in autopsy tissues by IHC or EM. We show that IHC usingantibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid yields the highest sensitivity andspecificity. We found a positive correlation between presence of viral proteinsby IHC and RT-qPCR-determined SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (N= 35; r=-0.83, p-value <0.0001). For EM, we refined criteria for virus identification and providerecommendations for optimized sampling and analysis. 135 of 144 publicationsmisinterpret cellular structures as virus using EM or show only insufficientdata. We provide publicly accessible digitized EM sections as a reference and fortraining purposes. INTERPRETATION: Since detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human autopsytissues by IHC and EM is difficult and frequently incorrect, we propose criteria for a re-evaluation of available data and guidance for further investigations of direct organ effects by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - To elucidate interannual changes in the vertical distribution of (137)Cs inforest ecosystems contaminated by the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plantaccident, we investigated (137)Cs inventories in forest soils (both organic andmineral soil horizons) at 10 sampling plots with different (137)Cs depositionlevels and dominant species for up to 10 years after the accident. We examinedthe temporal variation of the (137)Cs inventories by depth with exponentialregression models (assuming that the transition and partitioning of (137)Cs arestill active) and exponential offset regression models (assuming a shift to astable (137)Cs distribution, defined as the "quasi-equilibrium steady-state" inthe Chernobyl accident). In the organic horizon, the (137)Cs inventories wereexponentially decreasing, and it might take more time to converge in thequasi-equilibrium steady-state at most plots. In the mineral soil horizon, mostof (137)Cs was found in the surface layer of the mineral soil horizon (0-5 cm).In this layer, the inventories first increased and then become relativelyconstant, and the exponential offset model was selected at most plots, suggestingentry into the quasi-equilibrium steady-state over the observation period.Although we also observed exponentially increasing trends in a lower layer (5-10 cm) of the mineral soil horizon, there was no clear increasing or decreasingtrend of (137)Cs inventory in the deeper mineral soil layers (10-15 and 15-20cm). Our calculation of the relaxation depth and migration center revealed thatdownward migration of (137)Cs is not significant in terms of the overall (137)Cs distribution in the mineral soil horizon over 10 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ginseng is deemed to be an effective anti-aging therapy. Evidence fordifferences in representative active ingredients and anti-aging effects betweengarden ginseng (GG) and ginseng under forest (FG) is insufficient. PURPOSE: Thestudy was designed to systematically analyze the differences in the mechanisticprotective effects of GG and FG on aging mice based on their compositionaldifferences. METHODS: The chemical ingredients in GG and FG were firstdetermined. In vivo, D-galactose-induced aging mice were orally administered GGor FG (400 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Behavioral parameters of mice were measured bythe radial 8-arm maze, and the changes in body weight and organ indices wererecorded. Blood, brain tissue, and feces were collected for biochemical analysis,histopathological staining, Western blotting, and 16S rDNA intestinal florasequencing, respectively. RESULTS: The absolute contents of total ginsenosides,polyphenols, crude polysaccharides, starch, and protein in GG were 0.71, 0.68,1.15, 2.27, and 1.08 folds higher than those in FG, respectively; while FGexhibited a higher relative abundance of representative active ingredients (totalginsenosides, polyphenols, crude polysaccharides, and protein) but lower relativecontent of starch than GG. GG and FG improved hippocampal lesions and poor weightgain, organ indices, and behavioral indices, and prevented excessive oxidativestress and acetylcholinesterase activity in aging mice. What's more, GG and FGtreatment ameliorated excessive apoptosis and inflammatory reaction in the aging brain by modulating apoptosis-related proteins, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, andSIRT1/NF-kappaB pathway. GG and FG also restored the diversity and structure ofgut microbiota, up-regulated the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g.,Lactobacillus), and tended to exert key anti-aging effects via themicrobiota-gut-brain axis. Notably, in vivo experiments confirmed that FG had astronger anti-aging activity than GG. CONCLUSION: FG exerts a more powerfulanti-aging effect than GG by regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis,inflammation, and the microbe-gut-brain axis, possibly relying on the higherrelative abundance of representative active ingredients (total ginsenosides,polyphenols, crude polysaccharides, and protein) in FG.

AB  - An elevated plasma level of soluble ST2 (sST2) is a risk biomarker forgraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and death in patients receiving hematopoieticcell transplantation (HCT). sST2 functions as a trap for IL-33 and amplifies the pro-inflammatory type 1 and 17 response while suppressing the tolerogenic type 2 and regulatory T cells activation during GVHD development. We previouslyidentified small-molecule ST2 inhibitors particularly iST2-1 that reduces plasma sST2 levels and improved survival in two animal models. Here, we reported thestructure-activity relationship of the furanylmethylpyrrolidine-based ST2inhibitors based on iST2-1. Based on the biochemical AlphaLISA assay, we improvedthe activity of iST2-1 by 6-fold ( approximately 6 muM in IC50 values) in theinhibition of ST2/IL-33 and confirmed the activities of the compounds in acellular reporter assay. To determine the inhibition of the alloreactivity invitro, we used the mixed lymphocyte reaction assay to demonstrate that our ST2inhibitors decreased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells proliferation and increased Tregpopulation. The data presented in this work are critical to the development ofST2 inhibitors in future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the biodiversity hypothesis of immune-mediated diseases,lack of microbiological diversity in the everyday living environment is a corereason for dysregulation of immune tolerance and - eventually - the epidemic ofimmune-mediated diseases in western urban populations. Despite years of intenseresearch, the hypothesis was never tested in a double-blinded andplacebo-controlled intervention trial. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to perform the firstplacebo-controlled double-blinded test that investigates the effect ofbiodiversity on immune tolerance. METHODS: In the intervention group, childrenaged 3-5 years were exposed to playground sand enriched with microbially diverse soil, or in the placebo group, visually similar, but microbially poor sandcolored with peat (13 participants per treatment group). Children played twice a day for 20 min in the sandbox for 14 days. Sand, skin and gut bacterial, andblood samples were taken at baseline and after 14 days. Bacterial changes werefollowed for 28 days. Sand, skin and gut metagenome was determined by highthroughput sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene. Cytokines were measured fromplasma and the frequency of blood regulatory T cells was defined as a percentage of total CD3 +CD4 + T cells. RESULTS: Bacterial richness (P < 0.001) anddiversity (P < 0.05) were higher in the intervention than placebo sand. Skinbacterial community, including Gammaproteobacteria, shifted only in theintervention treatment to resemble the bacterial community in the enriched sand(P < 0.01). Mean change in plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration and IL-10 to IL-17A ratio supported immunoregulation in the intervention treatment comparedto the placebo treatment (P = 0.02). IL-10 levels (P = 0.001) and IL-10 to IL-17Aratio (P = 0.02) were associated with Gammaproteobacterial community on the skin.The change in Treg frequencies was associated with the relative abundance of skinThermoactinomycetaceae 1 (P = 0.002) and unclassified Alphaproteobacteria (P <0.001). After 28 days, skin bacterial community still differed in theintervention treatment compared to baseline (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first double-blinded placebo-controlled study to show that daily exposure tomicrobial biodiversity is associated with immune modulation in humans. Thefindings support the biodiversity hypothesis of immune-mediated diseases. Weconclude that environmental microbiota may contribute to child health, and thatadding microbiological diversity to everyday living environment may supportimmunoregulation.

TI  - Culture-Free Quantification of Bacteria Using Digital Fluorescence Imaging in aTunable Magnetic Capturing Cartridge for Onsite Food Testing.
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c00372 [doi]
AB  - Accurate, onsite detection of pathogenic bacteria from food matrices is required to rapidly respond to pathogen outbreaks. However, accurately detectingwhole-cell bacteria in large sample volumes without an enrichment step remains a challenge. Therefore, bacterial samples must be concentrated, identified, andquantified. We developed a tunable magnetic capturing cartridge (TMCC) andcombined it with a portable digital fluorescence reader for quick, onsite,quantitative detection of Staphylococcus aureus. The TMCC platform integrates an absorption pad impregnated with water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with aninjection-molded polycarbonate (PC) plate that has a hard magnet on its back and an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene case. An S. aureus-specific antibodyconjugated with magnetic nanoparticles was used to concentrate bacteria from alarge-volume sample and capture bacteria within the TMCC. The retention time for capturing bacteria on the TMCC was adjusted by controlling the concentration and volume of the PVA solution. Concentrated bacterial samples bound totarget-specific aptamer probes conjugated with quantum dots were loaded into the TMCC for a controlled time, followed by attachment of the bacteria to the PCplate and removal of unbound aptamer probes with wash buffer. The capturedbacteria were quantified using a digital fluorescence reader equipped with anembedded program that automatically counts fluorescently tagged bacteria. Thebacterial count made using the TMCC was comparable to a standard plate count(R(2) = 0.9898), with assay sensitivity and specificity of 94.3 and 100%,respectively.

LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c00788 [doi]
AB  - Rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of bacterial infection diseases providesclinical benefits of prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy and reduction of the overuse/misuse of unnecessary antibiotics for nonbacterial infections. Wepresent here a POC compatible method for rapid bacterial infection detection in10 min. We use a large-volume solution scattering imaging (LVSi) system with low magnifications (1-2x) to visualize bacteria in clinical samples, thus eliminatingthe need for culture-based isolation and enrichment. We tracked multipleintrinsic phenotypic features of individual cells in a short video. By clusteringthese features with a simple machine learning algorithm, we can differentiateEscherichia coli from similar-sized polystyrene beads, distinguish bacteria with different shapes, and distinguish E. coli from urine particles. We applied themethod to detect urinary tract infections in 104 patient urine samples with a 30 s LVSi video, and the results showed 92.3% accuracy compared with the clinicalculture results. This technology provides opportunities for rapid bacterialinfection diagnosis at POC settings.

AB  - Exosomes show great potential in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.Inspired by human innate immune defense, herein, we report engineeredexosomes-derived from monocytic cells treated with immunomodulating compounds1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and CYP24A1 inhibitor VID400 which are slowlyreleased from electrospun nanofiber matrices. These engineered exosomes containsignificantly more cathelicidin/LL-37 when compared with exosomes-derived fromeither untreated cells or Cathelicidin Human Tagged ORF Clone transfected cells. In addition, such exosomes exhibit multiple biological functions evidenced bykilling bacteria, facilitating human umbilical vein endothelial cell tubeformation, and enhancing skin cell proliferation and migration. Taken together,the engineered exosomes developed in this study could be used as therapeuticsalone or in combination with other biomaterials for effective infectionmanagement, wound healing, and tissue regeneration.

TI  - N-Arylimidazoliums as Highly Selective Biomimetic Antimicrobial Agents.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00818 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic resistance has become one of the greatest health threats in the world.In this study, a charge-dispersed dimerization strategy is described for theantimicrobial peptide (AMP) mimics via a tunable cationic charge to improve theselectivity between prokaryotic microbes and eukaryotic cells. This strategy isdemonstrated with a series of charge-dispersed AMP mimics based onN-arylimidazolium skeletons. These N-arylimidazolium AMP mimics show potentantibacterial activity against strains along with a low rate of drug resistance, good hemocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity. In addition to the elimination ofplanktonic bacteria, N-arylimidazolium AMP mimics can also inhibit biofilmformation and destroy the established biofilm. More importantly,methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-induced lung-infected mice canbe effectively treated by the intravenous administration of N-arylimidazolium AMPmimic, which enable the design of N-arylimidazolium AMP mimics to offer analternative avenue to eradicate drug-resistant bacterial infection.

TI  - Using Culture-Enriched Phenotypic Metagenomics for Targeted High-ThroughputMonitoring of the Clinically Important Fraction of the beta-Lactam Resistome.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c03627 [doi]
AB  - High bacterial community diversity and complexity greatly challenge thecost-efficient monitoring of clinically prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are usually present as rare and important populations involved in theenvironmental dissemination of clinical resistance. Here, we introduceculture-enriched phenotypic metagenomics that integrates culture enrichment,phenotypic screening, and metagenomic analyses as an emerging standardizedmethodology for targeted resistome monitoring and apply it to decipher theextended-spectrum beta-lactam resistome in a municipal wastewater treatment plant(WWTP) and its receiving river. The results showed that clinically prevalentcarbapenemase genes (e.g., the NDM and KPC families) and extended-spectrumbeta-lactamase genes (e.g., the CTX-M, TEM, and OXA families) were prevalent inthe WWTP and showed prominent potential in horizontal dissemination. Strikingly, carbapenem and polymyxin resistance genes co-occurred in the highly virulentnosocomial pathogens Enterobacter kobei and Citrobacter freundii. Overall, thisstudy exemplifies phenotypic metagenomics for high-throughput surveillance of atargeted clinically important fraction of antibiotic resistomes and substantiallyexpands current knowledge on extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance in WWTPs.

TI  - Asymmetrical forward and reverse developmental trajectories determine molecularprograms of B cell antigen receptor editing.
PG  - eabm1664
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.abm1664 [doi]
AB  - During B lymphopoiesis, B cell progenitors progress through alternating andmutually exclusive stages of clonal expansion and immunoglobulin (Ig) generearrangements. Great diversity is generated through the stochastic recombinationof Ig gene segments encoding heavy and light chain variable domains. However,this commonly generates autoreactivity. Receptor editing is the predominanttolerance mechanism for self-reactive B cells in the bone marrow (BM). B cellreceptor editing rescues autoreactive B cells from negative selection throughrenewed light chain recombination first at Igkappa then Iglambda loci. Receptorediting depends on BM microenvironment cues and key transcription factors such asNF-kappaB, FOXO, and E2A. The specific BM factor required for receptor editing isunknown. Furthermore, how transcription factors coordinate these developmentalprograms to promote usage of the lambda chain remains poorly defined. Therefore, we used two mouse models that recapitulate pathways by which Iglambda lightchain-positive B cells develop. The first has deleted J kappa (Jkappa) genes and hence models Iglambda expression resulting from failed Igkappa recombination(Igkappa(del)). The second models autoreactivity by ubiquitous expression of asingle-chain chimeric anti-Igkappa antibody (kappa-mac). Here, we demonstratedthat autoreactive B cells transit asymmetric forward and reverse developmentaltrajectories. This imparted a unique epigenetic landscape on small pre-B cells,which opened chromatin to transcription factors essential for Iglambdarecombination. The consequences of this asymmetric developmental path were bothamplified and complemented by CXCR4 signaling. These findings reveal howintrinsic molecular programs integrate with extrinsic signals to drive receptorediting.

AB  - The loss of detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered afunctional cure in chronic hepatitis B. Naturally, HBsAg can be incorporated intothe virion envelope or assembled into subviral particles (SVPs) with lipid fromhost cells. Until now, there has been no detailed structure of HBsAg, and thepublished SVP structures are controversial. Here, we report the firstsubnanometer-resolution structures of spherical SVP from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the related woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) determined by cryo-electronmicroscopy in combination with AlphaFold2 prediction. Both structures showedunique rhombicuboctahedral symmetry with 24 protruding spikes comprising dimer ofsmall HBsAg with four helical domains. The lipid moiety in the SVP is organizedin a noncanonical lipid patch instead of a lipid bilayer, which can accommodatethe exposed hydrophobic surface and modulate particle stability. Together, these findings advance our knowledge of viral membrane organization and the structures of HBV and WHV spherical SVPs.

TI  - Effect of atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) on chlorine adapted Salmonella entericaon spring onion.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13799 [doi]
AB  - One of the main drawbacks of chlorine disinfectants is the emergence of chlorine adapted (CA) or resistant microbial cells. This research aimed to investigate theeffect of chlorine adaptation on resistance of Salmonella enterica uponatmospheric cold plasma (ACP) application at different voltages (6, 8, and 11 kV)and times (5, 10, and 15 min). Due to higher conversion efficiency and reduceddielectric barrier discharge (DBD) power consumption, this method was used forcold plasma generation in this study. A higher lethality effect was observed froma higher voltage and longest times (11 kV-15 min) on CA S. enterica than non-CA(p<0.05). Still, it induced higher percentages of injured cells in CA (58.77%)than non-CA (0.61%) (p<0.05). The highest ACP effect on the inactivation of theindigenous natural flora of onion leaves was observed at the lowest voltage(p<0.05). More than 3 log CFU/g reduction (p<0.05) was observed at 6 kV after 5and 10 min. ACP reduced CA and non-CA S. enterica cells on onion leaf surface to a lower extent than pure treated cells in broth media. Nevertheless similar tobroth media, a high percentage of injury (61.03%) was induced on CA cells athigher voltage (11 kV-10 min) compared to non-CA (2.15%) (p<0.05). Biofilmresults revealed ACP application (6 kV-5 min) reduced average ODs in CA andnon-CA cells (p<0.05). Chlorine adaptation and ACP treatment influenced theantibiotic resistance pattern according to applied voltage, time, and antibiotic type. The finding showed despite highest lethality of high voltages and longtimes (11 kV-15 min), given the high percentages of injured cells, lower voltagesmay offer acceptable inactivation of pathogenic bacteria with lower injuryinduction. In conclusion, ACP has the potential ability to eliminate CA cells of S. enterica, which is predominant in fresh-cut vegetable outbreaks.

TI  - Prediction of drug resistance by Sanger sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains isolated from multidrug resistant tuberculosis suspect patientsin Ethiopia.
PG  - e0271508
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is one of the high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)burden countries. However, phenotypic drug susceptibility testing can takeseveral weeks due to the slow growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)strains. In this study, we assessed the performance of a Sanger sequencingapproach to predict resistance against five anti-tuberculosis drugs and thepattern of resistance mediating mutations. METHODS: We enrolled 226 MTBCculture-positive MDR-TB suspects and collected sputum specimens andsocio-demographic and TB related data from each suspect between June 2015 andDecember 2016 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing(pDST) for rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycinusing BACTEC MGIT 960 was compared with the results of a Sanger sequencinganalysis of seven resistance determining regions in the genes rpoB, katG,fabG-inhA, pncA, embB, rpsL, and rrs. RESULT: DNA isolation for Sanger sequencingwas successfully extracted from 92.5% (209/226) of the MTBC positive cultures,and the remaining 7.5% (17/226) strains were excluded from the final analysis.Based on pDST results, drug resistance proportions were as follows: isoniazid:109/209 (52.2%), streptomycin: 93/209 (44.5%), rifampicin: 88/209 (42.1%),ethambutol: 74/209 (35.4%), and pyrazinamide: 69/209 (33.0%). Resistance against isoniazid was mainly mediated by the mutation katG S315T (97/209, 46.4%) andresistance against rifampicin by rpoB S531L (58/209, 27.8%). The dominatingresistance-conferring mutations for ethambutol, streptomycin, and pyrazinamideaffected codon 306 in embB (48/209, 21.1%), codon 88 in rpsL (43/209, 20.6%), andcodon 65 in pncA (19/209, 9.1%), respectively. We observed a high agreementbetween phenotypic and genotypic DST, such as 89.9% (at 95% confidence interval[CI], 84.2%-95.8%) for isoniazid, 95.5% (95% CI, 91.2%-99.8%) for rifampicin,98.6% (95% CI, 95.9-100%) for ethambutol, 91.3% (95% CI, 84.6-98.1%) forpyrazinamide and 57.0% (95% CI, 46.9%-67.1%) for streptomycin. CONCLUSION: Wedetected canonical mutations implicated in resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid,pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin. High agreement with phenotypic DSTresults for all drugs renders Sanger sequencing promising to be performed as acomplementary measure to routine phenotypic DST in Ethiopia. Sanger sequencingdirectly from sputum may accelerate accurate clinical decision-making in thefuture.

AB  - Antibiotics were once used in animal production to improve productivity andresistance to pathogenic microbiota. However, due to its negative effects, thesearch for a new class of substances that can replace its efficacy has become oneof the urgent problems to be solved. Plant essential oils (EOs) as a natural feedadditive can maintain microbiota homeostasis and improve animal performance.However, its specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated.Therefore, we added different doses of essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum(EOZB) to the diets of Small Tail Han Sheep hybrid male lambs (STH lambs) toevaluate the effect of EOZB on rumen enzyme activity, rumen microbiology, and itsmetabolites in STH lambs. Twenty STH lambs were randomly divided into four groups(n = 5/group) and provided with the same diet. The dietary treatments were asfollows: basal diet (BD) group; BD+EOZB 5 ml/kg group; BD+EOZB 10 ml/kg group;BD+EOZB 15 ml/kg group. We found that EOZB 10 ml/kg helped to increase rumenpectinase (P<0.05) and lipase (P<0.05) activities. Microbial 16S rRNA geneanalysis showed that EOZB significantly altered the abundance of rumen microbiota(P<0.05). LC/GC-MS metabolomic analysis showed that the addition of EOZB produceda total of 1073 differential metabolites, with 58 differential metabolitesremaining after raising the screening criteria. These differential metaboliteswere mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, choline metabolism incancer, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, andprotein digestion and absorption. Correlation analysis showed that some rumenmicrobiota were significantly correlated with differential metabolite and enzyme activities.

AB  - In this study, we sequenced a bacteria isolate Pandoraea sp. 892iso isolated froma Phytophthora rubi strain which is an important plant pathogenic oomycete,identified through genome and combined the data with existing genomic data fromother 28 the genus of Pandoraea species. Next, we conducted a comparative genomicanalysis of the genome structure, evolutionary relationships, and pathogeniccharacteristics of Pandoraea species. Our results identified Pandoraea sp. 892isoas Pandoraea sputorum at both the genome and gene levels. At the genome level, wecarried out phylogenetic analysis of single-copy, gene co-linearity, ANI (averagenucleotide identity) and AAI (average amino acid identity) indices, rpoBsimilarity, MLSA phylogenetic analysis, and genome-to-genome distance calculator calculations to identify the relationship between Pandoraea sp. 892iso and P.sputorum. At the gene level, the quorum sensing genes ppnI and ppnR and theOXA-159 gene were assessed. It is speculated that Pandoraea sp. 892iso is theendosymbiont of the Oomycetes strain of Phytophthora rubi.

LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005467 [doi]
AB  - An orange-golden iridescent culture, designated A1X5R2(T), was isolated from acompost soil suspension which was amended with Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665(T)culture supernatant. The cells were non-motile, Gram-stain-negative, 0.4-0.5microm wide and 0.7-1.4 microm long. The 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic andwhole-genome analyses revealed that strain A1X5R2(T) forms a distinct lineagewithin the family Sphingosinicellaceae and is closely related to members of thegenus Sphingoaurantiacus (S. capsulatus, 93.04 % similarity, and S.polygranulatus, 92.77 %). The organism grew at 22-47 degrees C (optimal at 37degrees C), salinity <3 % (optimal at 1.5 %) and at pH 7. The major respiratoryquinone was ubiquinone-10, but a small quantity of ubiquinone-9 was also detectedThe major polyamine was homospermidine, but a small quantity of putrescine wasalso detected. The strain contained C18 : 1omega7c, C16 : 0, C16 : 1 omega7c and C18 : 0 as the major fatty acids. The main polar lipids werephosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine,phosphatidylinositol, sphingoglycolipid, diphosphatidylglycerol, two unidentifiedphospholipids and three unidentified amino lipids. The DNA G+C content was 64.9mol%. According to the results of phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses, as wellas its physiological characteristics, strain A2X5R2(T) represents the typespecies of a novel genus within the family Sphingosinicellaceae. The namePedomonas mirosovicensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strainbeing A1X5R2(T) (=NCCB 100839(T)=DSM 112829(T)).

AB  - AbstractAirway microenvironment played an important role in the progression ofchronic respiratory disease. Here we showed that standardized pondus hydrogenii(pH) of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of bronchiectasis patients wassignificantly lower than that of controls and was significantly correlated withbronchiectasis severity index (BSI) scores and disease prognosis. EBC pH waslower in severe patients than that in mild and moderate patients. Besides, acidicmicroenvironment deteriorated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) pulmonaryinfection in mice models. Mechanistically, acidic microenvironment increased P.aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles (PA_OMVs) release and boosted it induced theactivation of interferon regulatory factor3 (IRF3)-interferonbeta (IFN-beta)signaling pathway, ultimately compromised the anti-bacteria immunity. Targetedknockout of IRF3 or type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated lung damageand lethality of mice after P. aeruginosa infection that aggravated by acidicmicroenvironment. Together, these findings identified airway acidificationimpaired host resistance to P. aeruginosa infection by enhancing its induced the activation of IRF3-IFN-beta signaling pathway. Standardized EBC pH may be auseful biomarker of disease severity and a potential therapeutic target for therefractory P. aeruginosa infection. The study also provided one more referenceparameter for drug selection and new drug discovery for bronchiectasis.

AB  - The use of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in consumer products hasincreased dramatically. Accordingly, human exposure to these NPs has increased.Lactobacillus reuteri, a member of the beneficial gut microbiota, is essentialfor human health. In the present study, the toxic effect of three metal oxides(CuO, ZnO, and CdO) and one metal (Ag) NPs on L. reuteri were investigated invitro. L. reuteri was susceptible to all the prepared NPs in a dose-dependentmanner, visualized as an increase in the zones of inhibition and a significantreduction in the maximum specific growth rates (micromax). The minimal inhibitoryconcentrations were 5.8, 26, 560, and 560 microg/mL for CdO-, Ag-, ZnO-, andCuO-NPs, respectively, and the respective minimal bactericidal concentrationswere 60, 70, 1500, and 1500 microg/mL. Electron microscopic examinations revealedthe adsorption of the prepared NPs on L. reuteri cell surface, causing cell wall disruption and morphological changes. These changes were accompanied bysignificant leakage of cellular protein content by 214%, 191%, 112%, and 101%versus the untreated control when L. reuteri was treated with CdO-, Ag-, CuO-,and ZnO-NPs, respectively. NPs also induced oxidative damage, where themalondialdehyde level was significantly increased, and glutathione content wassignificantly decreased. Quantifying the DNA damage using comet assay showed thatCuONPs had the maximum DNA tail length (8.2 px vs. 2.1 px for the control). WhileCdONPs showed the maximum percentage of DNA in tail (15.5% vs. 3.1%). This study provides a mechanistic evaluation of the NPs-mediated toxicity to a beneficialmicroorganism.

AB  - The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri is known as a highly host-adapted human pathogen. There had been no known other reservoirs reported until recently.Here 34 isolates obtained from animals (yaks, dairy cows and beef cattle) from2016-2017 and 268 human S. flexneri isolates from China were sequenced todetermine the relationships between animal and human isolates and infer theevolutionary history of animal-associated S. flexneri. The 18 animal isolates (15yak and 3 beef cattle isolates) in PG1 were separated into 4 lineages, and the 16animal isolates (1 yak, 5 beef cattle and 10 dairy cow isolates) in PG3 wereclustered in 8 lineages. The most recent human isolates from China belonged toPG3 whereas Chinese isolates from the 1950s-1960s belonged to PG1. PG1 S.flexneri may has been transmitted to the yaks during PG1 circulation in the humanpopulation in China and has remained in the yak population since, while PG3 S.flexneri in animals were likely recent transmissions from the human population.Increased stability of the large virulence plasmid and acquisition of abundantantimicrobial resistance determinants may have enabled PG3 to expand globally andreplaced PG1 in China. Our study confirms that animals may act as a reservoir forS. flexneri. Genomic analysis revealed the evolutionary history of multiple S.flexneri lineages in animals and humans in China. However, further studies arerequired to determine the public health threat of S. flexneri from animals.

AB  - Sperm motility, normal morphology, viability, spermatozoa DNA damage, and lipidperoxidation are all affected by semen cryopreservation. The goal of this studywas to see how effective cupric oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) are as acryo-extender additive on post-thawed sperm parameters. An artificial vagina was used to collect semen samples from five mature Zaraibi bucks (2-3 years).Ejaculates were pooled and separated into two fractions (A&B), a fraction (A) wasleft without being centrifuged and a fraction (B) was centrifuged to removeseminal plasma. Both fractions were diluted with tris egg yolk citrate extender(TECE) and then divided into five equal aliquots, each supplemented with (0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 ppm/ml) CuONPs. The findings revealed that removing seminal plasmabefore cryopreservation harms sperm parameters. Sperm motility, viability index, membrane integrity, biochemical antioxidant marker, DNA integrity, and MDA level improved after supplementation with CuONPs up to 60 ppm/ml, the most prominentsignificant positive effect was obtained with the highest dose (60 ppm/ml)without removal of the seminal plasm compared to control group. In conclusion:The presence of seminal plasma with a high concentration of CuONPs (up to 60ppm/ml) may help to mitigate the negative effects of cryo-preservation.

LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000860 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 200 O-serogroups of Vibrio cholerae have already been identified;however, only 2 serogroups, O1 and O139, are strongly related to pandemiccholera. The study of non-O1 and non-O139 strains has hitherto been limited.Nevertheless, there are other clinically and epidemiologically importantserogroups causing outbreaks with cholera-like disease. Here, we report acomprehensive genome analysis of the whole set of V. cholerae O-serogroupreference strains to provide an overview of this important bacterial pathogen. Itrevealed structural diversity of the O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters locatedat specific loci on chromosome 1 and 16 pairs of strains with almost identicalO-antigen biosynthetic gene clusters but differing in serological patterns. This might be due to the presence of O-antigen biosynthesis-related genes at secondaryloci on chromosome 2.

TI  - Identification of micro-organism from positive blood cultures: comparison ofthree different short culturing methods to the Rapid Sepsityper workflow.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001571 [doi]
AB  - Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The rapid identification (ID) of the causative micro-organisms is crucial for the patients' clinicaloutcome. MALDI-TOF MS has been widely investigated to speed up the time-to-reportfor ID from positive blood cultures, and many different procedures and protocols were developed, all of them attributable either to the direct separation ofmicrobial cells from the blood cells, or to a short subculture approach. In this study, the Rapid Sepsityper workflow (MBT Sepsityper IVD Kit, Bruker DaltonicsGmbH and Co. KG, Bremen, Germany) was compared to three different shortsubculturing methods, established into the routine practice of three differentclinical microbiology laboratories. A total of N=503 routine samples wereincluded in this study and tested in parallel with the two approaches. Results ofthe rapid procedures were finally compared to routine proceedings withGram-staining and overnight subculture. Among monomicrobial samples, the RapidSepsityper workflow enabled overall the correct identification of 388/443 (87.6%) micro-organisms, while the short subculturing methods of 267/435 (61.8 %).Except for the performance with Streptococcus pneumoniae, in each one of thethree sites the Rapid Sepsityper workflow proved to be superior to the shortsubculture method, regardless of the protocol applied, and it delivered a result from 1 to 5 h earlier.

AB  - Various studies have shown that the microbial proteins are often more stable thanbelongs to other sources like plant and animal origin. Hence, the interest inmicrobial enzymes has gained much attention due to many potential applicationslike bioenergy, biofuel production, biobleaching, bioconversion and so on.Additionally, recent trends revealed that the interest in isolating novelmicrobes from harsh environments have been the main focus of many scientists for various applications. Basically, industrially important enzymes can becategorized into mainly three groups: carbohydrases, proteases, and lipases.Among those, the enzymes especially carbohydrases involved in production ofsugars. Carbohydrases include amylases, xylanases, pectinases, cellulases,chitinases, mannases, laccases, ligninases, lactase, glucanase, and glucoseoxidase. Thus, here, an approach has been made to highlight five enzymes namelyamylase, cellulase, laccase, pectinase, and xylanase from different sources with special emphasis on their properties, mechanism, applications, productionoptimization, purification, molecular approaches for its enhanced and stableproduction, and also biotechnological perspectives of its future development.Also, green and sustainable catalytic conversion strategies using nanoparticlesof these enzymes have also been discussed. This review will provide insight into the carbohydrases importance and their usefulness that will help to theresearchers working in this field.

PG  - e2225430
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25430 [doi]
AB  - Importance: SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has displayedperson-to-person transmission in a variety of indoor situations. This potentialfor robust transmission has posed significant challenges and concerns forday-to-day activities of colleges and universities where indoor learning is afocus for students, faculty, and staff. Objective: To assess whether in-classinstruction without any physical distancing, but with other public healthmitigation strategies, is a risk for driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Design,Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined the evidence for SARS-CoV-2transmission on a large urban US university campus using contact tracing, classattendance, and whole genome sequencing during the 2021 fall semester. Eligibleparticipants were on-campus and off-campus individuals involved in campusactivities. Data were analyzed between September and December 2021. Exposures:Participation in class and work activities on a campus with mandated vaccination and indoor masking but that was otherwise fully open without physical distancing during a time of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, both at the university andin the surrounding counties. Main Outcomes and Measures: Likelihood of in-classinfection was assessed by measuring the genetic distance between all potentialin-class transmission pairings using polymerase chain reaction testing. Results: More than 600000 polymerase chain reaction tests were conducted throughout thesemester, with 896 tests (0.1%) showing detectable SARS-CoV-2; there were over850 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified through weekly surveillance testing of all students and faculty on campus during the fall 2021 semester. The rolling mean average of positive tests ranged between 4 and 27 daily cases. Of more than 140000 in-person class events and a total student population of 33000 betweengraduate and undergraduate students, only 9 instances of potential in-classtransmission were identified, accounting for 0.0045% of all classroom meetings.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, the data suggested that underrobust transmission abatement strategies, in-class instruction was not anappreciable source of disease transmission.

AB  - Today, with the intensity of antibiotic abuse and self-medication, the need forthe use of novel systems with high efficiency and biosafety for targeted drugdelivery against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their infections should behighly considered by researchers. Silica-based nanosystems with uniquephysicochemical properties such as large surface area, tuneable pore diameter,drug loading capacity, controlled particle size/morphology, and goodbiocompatibility are attractive candidates against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and pathogenic viruses. They can be loaded with antiviral and antimicrobial drugsor molecules through their exclusive internal porous structures or differentsurface linkers. In this context, smart nanosystems can be produced via suitable surface functionalization/modification with a variety of functional groups to actagainst different clinical pathogenic microbes or viruses, offering greatopportunities for controlling and treating various infections. However, importantcriteria such as the ability to degrade, biocompatibility, biodegradability,cytotoxicity, stability, clearance from targeted organs should be systematically analysed to develop nanosystems or nanocarriers with high efficiency andmultifunctionality. Herein, recent advancements pertaining to the application of silica-based nanosystems against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and pathogenicviruses are deliberated, focussing on important challenges and futureperspectives.

TI  - The Impact of Land Tenure Security on a Livelihood Intervention for People Livingwith HIV in Western Kenya.
LID - 10.1007/s10461-022-03760-z [doi]
AB  - Few studies have explored land access, a structural driver of health, and women'sparticipation in livelihood interventions to improve food security and HIVoutcomes. This qualitative study, embedded within Shamba Maisha (NCT02815579)-arandomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the impact of a multisectoralintervention among farmers living with HIV in western Kenya-sought to explore theinfluence of perceived access to and control of land on agriculturalproductivity, investments, and benefits. Thirty in-depth interviews (IDIs) wereconducted with purposively sampled men and women, 3 to 6 months after receivingintervention inputs; data were deductively and inductively coded and analyzed.Farming practices and participation in Shamba Maisha were dependent on landtenure and participants' perceived strength of claim over their land, withparticipants who perceived themselves to be land insecure less likely to makelong-term agricultural investments. Land tenure was influenced by a number offactors and posed unique challenges for women which negatively impacted uptakeand success in the intervention. Data underscore the importance of secure landtenure for the success of similar interventions, especially for women; futureinterventions should integrate land security programming for improved outcomesfor all.

TI  - An insight into differential protein abundance throughout Leishmania donovanipromastigote growth and differentiation.
LID - 10.1007/s10123-022-00259-4 [doi]
AB  - Leishmania donovani causes anthroponotic visceral leishmaniasis, responsible for about 50,000 annual deaths worldwide. Current therapies have considerable sideeffects. Drug resistance has been reported and no vaccine is available nowadays. The development of undifferentiated promastigotes in the sand fly vector's gutleads to the promastigote form that is highly infective to the mammalian host.Fully differentiated promastigotes play a crucial role in the initial stages ofmammalian host infection before internalization in the host phagocytic cell.Therefore, the study of protein levels in the promastigote stage is relevant for disease control, and proteomics analysis is an ideal source of vaccine candidate discovery. This study aims to get insight into the protein levels during thedifferentiation process of promastigotes by 2DE-MALDI-TOF/TOF. This partialproteome analysis has led to the identification of 75 proteins increased in atleast one of the L. donovani promastigote differentiation and growth phases. Thisstudy has revealed the differential abundance of said proteins during growth and differentiation. According to previous studies, some are directly involved inparasite survival or are immunostimulatory. The parasite survival-relatedproteins are ascorbate peroxidase; cystathionine beta synthase; an elongationfactor 1beta paralog; elongation factor 2; endoribonuclease L-PSP; an ironsuperoxide dismutase paralog; GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase; several heat shockproteins-HSP70, HSP83-17, mHSP70-rel, HSP110; methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; two thiol-dependent reductase 1 paralogs; transitional endoplasmic reticulumATPase; and the AhpC thioredoxin paralog. The confirmed immunostimulatoryproteins are the heat shock proteins, enolase, and protein kinase C receptoranalog. The potential immunostimulatory molecules according to findings inpatogenic bacteria are fructose-1,6-diphophate aldolase, dihydrolipoamideacetyltransferase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha andE1beta subunits, and triosephosphate isomerase. These proteins may become diseasecontrol candidates through future intra-vector control methods or vaccines.

TI  - Diverse and distinct bacterial community involved in a full-scale A/O1/H/O2combination of bioreactors with simultaneous decarbonation and denitrogenation ofcoking wastewater.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22103-y [doi]
AB  - Taking into account difficulties in exhaustive simultaneous decarbonation anddenitrogenation in biological treatment of coking wastewater (CWW), a novelfull-scale CWW biological treatment sequentially combining anaerobic, aerobic,hydrolytic, and aerobic reactors (A/O1/H/O2) was designed performing excellentremoval of carbon-containing pollutants in the bioreactors A and O1, while thenitrogen-containing compounds in the bioreactors H and O2. To provide aneffective tool for the CWW treatment monitoring and control, the succession ofmicrobial community in this unique toxic CWW habitat should be established andcharacterized in detail. The results of 16S rRNA genes revealed Acidobacteriadominating in the unique CWW habitat. The dominant groups in bioreactors A and O1include Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria, while Proteobacteria,Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes dominate in reactors H and O2. Thegenera of Rhodoplanes, Bacillus, and Leucobacter are rich in genes responsiblefor the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathway. The Mantel test andPCA results showed the microbial communities of A/O1/H/O2 sequence correlatingstrongly with SRT, and COD load and removal. The co-occurrence network analysisindicated decarbonation and denitrogenation driven by two network modules having the keystone taxa belonging to the Comamonadaceae and Hyphomicrobiaceae families.The results significantly expanded the knowledge on the diversity, structure, andfunction of the CWW active sludge differentiating the relationships betweenbacterial communities and environmental variables in CWW treatment.

TI  - The Incidence Rate of Sexual Behaviors Among Cisgender Men who have Sex with Men Attending a Sexual Health Clinic.
LID - 10.1007/s10508-022-02370-z [doi]
AB  - Although nuanced parameterization of sexual behavior may improve estimates frommathematical models of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmittedinfection transmission, prospective estimates of the incidence of specific sexualbehaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM) are limited. From December 2014to July 2018, MSM with and without nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) completedweekly diaries over 3-12 weeks. Incidence rates of any sex, receptive anal sex,insertive anal sex, insertive oral sex, receptive rimming, and receptivehand-penile contact were 1.19, 0.28, 0.66, 0.90, 0.24, and 0.85 episodes perperson-week, respectively, among 104 MSM with NGU at baseline, and 1.33, 0.54,0.32, 0.95, 0.44, and 0.88 episodes per person-week, respectively, among 25 MSMwithout NGU at baseline. Most receptive anal sex (NGU + 83%, NGU - 86%) andinsertive anal sex (NGU + 85%, NGU - 76%) episodes were condomless. MSM engagedin sex just over once per week, and condom use was infrequent. Insertive oral sexand receptive hand-penile contact were the most common behaviors.

TI  - Structural determination of the lipid A from the deep-sea bacterium Zunongwangia profunda SM-A87: a small-scale approach.
LID - 10.1007/s10719-022-10076-6 [doi]
AB  - Zunongwangia profunda SM-A87 is a deep-sea sedimentary bacterium from the phylum Bacteroidetes, representing a new genus of Flavobacteriaceae. It was previouslyinvestigated for its capability of yielding high quantities of capsularpolysaccharides (CPS) with interesting rheological properties, including highviscosity and tolerance to high salinities and temperatures. However, as aGram-negative, Z. profunda SM-A87 also expresses lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as themain components of the external leaflet of its outer membrane. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of the glycolipid part of this LPS, i.e. thelipid A, which was achieved by-passing the extraction procedure of the full LPSand by working on the ethanol precipitation product, which contained both the CPSfraction and bacterial cells. To this aim a dual approach was adopted and allanalyses confirmed the isolation of Z. profunda SM-A87 lipid A that turned out tobe a blend of species with high levels of heterogeneity both in the acylation andphosphorylation pattern, as well as in the hydrophilic backbone composition.Mono-phosphorylated tetra- and penta-acylated lipid A species were identified andcharacterized by a high content of branched, odd-numbered, and unsaturated fatty acid chains as well as, for some species, by the presence of a hybriddisaccharide backbone.

TI  - Sugar Concentration, Nitrogen Availability, and Phylogenetic Factors Determinethe Ability of Acinetobacter spp. and Rosenbergiella spp. to Grow in FloralNectar.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-022-02088-4 [doi]
AB  - The floral nectar of angiosperms harbors a variety of microorganisms that depend predominantly on animal visitors for their dispersal. Although some members ofthe genus Acinetobacter and all currently known species of Rosenbergiella arethought to be adapted to thrive in nectar, there is limited information about theresponse of these bacteria to variation in the chemical characteristics of floralnectar. We investigated the growth performance of a diverse collection ofAcinetobacter (n = 43) and Rosenbergiella (n = 45) isolates obtained from floral nectar and the digestive tract of flower-visiting bees in a set of 12 artificial nectars differing in sugar content (15% w/v or 50% w/v), nitrogen content(3.48/1.67 ppm or 348/167 ppm of total nitrogen/amino nitrogen), and sugarcomposition (only sucrose, 1/3 sucrose + 1/3 glucose + 1/3 fructose, or 1/2glucose + 1/2 fructose). Growth was only observed in four of the 12 artificialnectars. Those containing elevated sugar concentration (50% w/v) and low nitrogencontent (3.48/1.67 ppm) were limiting for bacterial growth. Furthermore,phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ability of the bacteria to grow indifferent types of nectar is highly conserved between closely related isolatesand genotypes, but this conservatism rapidly vanishes deeper in phylogeny.Overall, these results demonstrate that the ability of Acinetobacter spp. andRosenbergiella spp. to grow in floral nectar largely depends on nectar chemistry and bacterial phylogeny.

AB  - The genus Haemaphysalis Koch, 1844 (Acari: Ixodidae) is the second-largest genus,with more than 170 described species that primarily parasitize mammals and birds (Guglielmone et al. 2014, Guglielmone et al. Zootaxa 4871(1): 001-322, 2020).Haemaphysalis species are three-host ticks, mainly distributed in southern andsoutheastern Asia and tropical Africa (Guglielmone et al. 2014). The presentstudy identified a tick, Haemaphysalis hoodi Warburton & Nuttall, 1909, collectedfrom a human in Yaounde, Cameroon. This tick species feed on birds in sub-SaharanAfrica. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second record of H. hoodi from humans. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome oxidase I sequences weregenerated for this species for the first time. Screening pan-Rickettsia-PCRinfection gave a negative result.

TI  - Three semi-selective media for Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola and P.cannabina pv. alisalensis.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12092-w [doi]
AB  - Three semi-selective media, DTarTA, SPbc, and SPamt, were developed and tested toisolate Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) and P. cannabina pv.alisalensis (Pca) from Raphanus sativus seeds. DTarTA contained D-tartaric acidas a carbon source and potassium tellurite, ampicillin sodium, and methyl violet as antibiotics. DTarTA suppressed growth in 19 of the 24 pathovars from the P.syringae complex, whereas Psm and Pca grew and formed gray to black colonies.SPamt contained sucrose and peptone as nutrient sources and was supplemented withbromothymol blue and the same antibiotics present in DTarTA and Psm and Pcaformed yellowish to dark brown colonies on the SPamt medium. SPbc containedsucrose and peptone and was supplemented with cephalexin and boric acid asantibiotics and Psm and Pca formed semi-translucent to white colonies on the SPbcmedium. SPamt and SPbc suppressed the growth of several plant-associated bacteria(except the P. syringae complex). The growth of saprophytic bacteria in seeds on the different media was compared with that on King's B medium, using five typesof commercially available Raphanus sativus seeds. The suppression rate of DTarTA was 85-99% and was lower for seeds with more saprophytic bacteria. Thesuppression rates of SPamt and SPbc were 90-99%. In detection tests using 10,000 seed samples mixed with Pca or Psm-contaminated seeds, it was possible toselectively isolate Psm and Pca using SPamt and SPbc, even when the colonynumbers of the target bacterium constituted less than 10% of the total colonies. KEY POINTS: * Bacterial leaf spot and blight pathogens were selectively isolated from seeds. * DTarTA medium distinguishes these pathogens from P. syringaecomplex pathovars. * SPamp and SPbc media have different selectivity forplant-associated bacteria.

TI  - Low biological phosphorus removal from effluents treated by slow sand filters.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12077-9 [doi]
AB  - The legislation for environment protection requires strict controls of thewastewater releasing in water bodies. The wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) havebeen used for organic matter degradation; however, the residual total phosphorus (TP) removal has not been efficient. TP and nitrogen present in wastewater areassociated to eutrophication of water bodies and algae growth. Therefore, thisstudy discusses the efficiency of phosphorus removal by a slow filter (SF),complementary to a WWTP and the microbial community involved. The results showed that the use of SF, with or without macrophytes, is not suitable to remove TP.Spatial variation in microbial communities distributed in three distinct zoneswas identified in the SF. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi andFirmicutes covered the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria. The acetogenesis,nitrification, and denitrification, as well as the removal of phosphorus from theeffluent, were performed by representatives affiliated to different groups.Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria among these,Dokdonella sp., Frateuria sp., Comamonas sp., Diaphorobacter sp., Nitrosospirasp., Ferruginibacter sp., Flavobacterium sp., and the uncultured OD1 were themost abundant bacteria in the SF. The low efficiency for TP removing from SFeffluents can be explained by the low abundance of phosphorus accumulatingorganisms (PAOs), with the association of the low concentration of biodegradable organic matter in the inlet effluent. Therefore, the alternative to using SF as acomplement to WWTPs, as recommended by some Brazilian environmental agencies, didnot prove to be viable and new approaches must be evaluated. KEY POINTS: * Thephosphorus removal was performed by a slow filter system in a WWTP but obtained alow efficiency. * Microbial spatial variation was distributed into distinct zonesfrom slow filter. * Low abundance of PAOs was observed due to the lowavailability of organic matter.

Following bloodcollection, serum levels of Thallium, Tellurium, Osmium, Lead, Mercury, andCadmium were estimated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass spectrophotometer.RESULTS: RPL patients exhibited significantly higher levels of heavy metals(P<0.001) when compared to control .Intriguingly, increased levels of serum TI,Te, Os and Pb were found negatively correlated with Total antioxidant status(P<0.05). Further, RPL group demonstrated strong positive correlation betweenheavy metals (TI, Te, Os and Pb) and DNA damage(P<0.05).No significantcorrelation between other heavy metals and markers of cellular damage was noted. CONCLUSION: Enhanced levels of heavy metals in RPL patients and correlation ofTI, Te, Os and Pb with markers of cellular damage is reflective of role of heavy metal intoxication specially TI, Te and Os as potential risk factors in etiology underlying recurrent miscarriage.

TI  - Converting cytochrome c into a DyP-like metalloenzyme.
LID - 10.1039/d2dt02137d [doi]
AB  - Dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP), which can degrade anthraquinone dyes usingH2O2, is an attractive prospect for potential biotechnological applications forenvironmental purification. We previously designed an artificial DyP with anoptimal pH for reactive blue 19 (RB19) degradation shifting from pH 4.5 to 6.5.We then attempted to degrade RB19 using Escherichia coli expressing this mutant, but RB19 was degraded equally compared with bacteria expressing wild-type (WT)DyP because most DyP was expressed in a heme-free form. In this study, weattempted to design an artificial peroxidase based on cytochrome c (cyt c), whoseheme is covalently bound to the protein. We found that cyt c can degrade RB19,but its ability at pH 7.0 was approximately 60% of that of DyP from Vibriocholerae at pH 4.5. To enhance this activity we constructed several mutants usingthree approaches. Initially, to improve reactivity with H2O2, Met80 was replaced with a noncoordinating residue, Ala or Val, but catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km)was increased by only approximately 1.5-fold. To enhance the substrate bindingaffinity we introduced an additional Trp by replacing Pro76 (P76W). The catalyticefficiency of this mutant was approximately 3-fold greater than that of WT cyt c.Finally, to form a hydrogen bond to axial histidine Gly29 was replaced with Asp(G29D). This mutant exhibited an approximately 80-fold greater dye-decolorizingactivity. Escherichia coli expressing the G29D mutant was unable to degrade RB19 in solution due to degradation of heme itself, but this study provides newinsights into the design of artificial DyPs.

TI  - Environmental Biodegradation of Water-Soluble Polymers: Key Considerations andWays Forward.
LID - 10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00232 [doi]
AB  - Water-soluble polymers (WSPs) have unique properties that are valuable in diverseapplications ranging from home and personal care products to agriculturalformulations. For applications that result in the release of WSPs into naturalenvironments or engineered systems, such as agricultural soils and wastewaterstreams, biodegradable as opposed to nonbiodegradable WSPs have the advantage of breaking down and, thereby, eliminating the risk of persistence and accumulation.In this Commentary, we emphasize central steps in WSP biodegradation, discuss howthese steps depend on both WSP properties and characteristics of the receivingenvironment, and highlight critical requirements for testing WSPbiodegradability.

TI  - Integrating Genome-Resolved Metagenomics with Trait-Based Process Modeling toDetermine Biokinetics of Distinct Nitrifying Communities within Activated Sludge.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02081 [doi]
AB  - Conventional bioprocess models for wastewater treatment are based on aggregatedbulk biomass concentrations and do not incorporate microbial physiologicaldiversity. Such a broad aggregation of microbial functional groups can fail topredict ecosystem dynamics when high levels of physiological diversity existwithin trophic guilds. For instance, functional diversity among nitrite-oxidizingbacteria (NOB) can obfuscate engineering strategies for their out-selection inactivated sludge (AS), which is desirable to promote energy-efficient nitrogenremoval. Here, we hypothesized that different NOB populations within AS can have different physiological traits that drive process performance, which we tested byestimating biokinetic growth parameters using a combination of highly replicated respirometry, genome-resolved metagenomics, and process modeling. A lab-scale AS reactor subjected to a selective pressure for over 90 days experienced resilienceof NOB activity. We recovered three coexisting Nitrospira population genomesbelonging to two sublineages, which exhibited distinct growth strategies andunderwent a compositional shift following the selective pressure. A trait-basedprocess model calibrated at the NOB genus level better predicted nitriteaccumulation than a conventional process model calibrated at the NOB guild level.This work demonstrates that trait-based modeling can be leveraged to improve our prediction, control, and design of functionally diverse microbiomes driving keyenvironmental biotechnologies.

TI  - High-Efficiency Near-Infrared Light Responsive Antibacterial System forSynergistic Ablation of Bacteria and Biofilm.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c08406 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infection is seriously threatening human health, and the design ofhigh-efficiency and good biocompatibility antibacterial agents is an urgentproblem to be solved. However, with the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, theexisting antibacterial agents have low killing efficiency, and the formation ofbiofilms has further weakened the therapeutic effect. Herein, we constructed anefficient antibacterial system mediated by near-infrared light for synergisticantibacterial and biofilm dissipation. Specifically, the ZnO/Ti3C2Tx withheterojunction was synthesized by hydrothermal growth of ZnO on the surface oflamellar Ti3C2Tx-MXene. The prepared ZnO/Ti3C2Tx had better photothermal ability than ZnO and Ti3C2Tx, respectively. The local thermal effect can not only destroythe integrity of the bacterial membrane but also promote the release of Zn(2+)ions and further improve the antibacterial performance. ZnO/Ti3C2Tx achieved a100% sterilization rate (better than either ZnO or Ti3C2Tx) at 150 mug mL(-1).The biofilm dissipation experiment further proved its excellent biofilm ablation effect. More importantly, the results of in vitro cell culture and animalexperiments have demonstrated its good biological safety. In summary, this newtype of nanomaterial shows strong local chemical photothermal sterilizationability and has great potential to replace traditional antibacterial agents.

TI  - Effect of Chain Stereoconfiguration on Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) CrystallizationKinetics.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00682 [doi]
AB  - Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is naturally accumulated by bacteria but can alsobe synthesized chemically. Its processability is limited, as it tends to degrade at temperatures above its melting temperature; hence, investigation intocrystallization kinetics and morphology of PHB materials of both natural andsynthetic origins is of great need and interest to get a better understanding of structure-property relationship. Accordingly, this contribution reports a firststudy of the crystallization and morphology of synthetic PHB materials ofdifferent molecular weights. These synthetic PHBs are racemic mixtures (50/50 mol%) of R and S chain configurations and are compared with an enantiopure bacterialR-PHB. Nonisothermal and isothermal crystallization studies show that R and Schains of PHB can cocrystallize in the same unit cell as the R-PHB. Mostsignificantly, the results show that the presence of S chains decreases theoverall crystallization rate, which could enhance the processability andindustrialization of PHB-based materials.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Analysis of Recurrent Gram-Negative BloodstreamInfections.
LID - ciac638 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The causes and clinical characteristics of recurrent gram-negativebacterial bloodstream infections (GNB-BSI) are poorly understood. METHODS: Weused a prospectively ascertained cohort of patients with GNB-BSI to identifyclinical characteristics, microbiology, and risk factors associated withrecurrent GNB-BSI. Bacterial genotyping (both pulsed field gel electrophoresis[PFGE] and whole genome sequencing [WGS]) was used to define whether theseepisodes were due to relapse or reinfection. Multivariable logistic regressionwas used to identify risk factors associated with recurrence. RESULTS: Of the1423 patients with GNB-BSI that met criteria for inclusion in this study, 60 (4%)had recurrent GNB-BSI. Non-white race (OR: 2.35; CI95% 1.38-4.01; p = 0.002),admission to a surgical service (OR: 2.18; CI95% 1.26-3.75; p = 0.005) andpresence of an indwelling cardiac device (OR: 2.73; CI95% 1.21-5.58, p = 0.009)were associated with increased risk for recurrent GNB-BSI. Among the 48 patients with recurrent GNB-BSI whose paired bloodstream isolates underwent genotyping,63% were due to relapse (30/48) and 38% were due to reinfection (18/48) based on WGS. Compared with WGS, PFGE correctly differentiated relapse and reinfection in 98% (47/48) of cases. Median time to relapse and reinfection was similar (113days [IQR: 35-222 days] vs. 174 days [IQR: 69-599 days], p = 0.13). Presence of acardiac device was associated with relapse (Relapse: 7/27 [26%]; Non-relapse:65/988 [7%]; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, recurrent GNB-BSI was mostcommonly due to relapse. PFGE accurately differentiated relapse from reinfection when compared with WGS. Presence of a cardiac device was a risk factor forrelapse.

TI  - In silico study of the proteins involved in the persistence of Brucella spp.
LID - 10.2174/1570163819666220805161821 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the major problems with Brucella infections is its tendency tobecome chronic and recurrent, providing a hindrance to the management of thisinfection. It has been proposed that chronicity is so much affected by aphenomenon called persistence in bacteria. Several mechanisms are involved inbacterial persistence, including the type II toxin-antitoxin system, the SOS,Oxidative , and stringent response. METHODS: In this in silico study, thesepersistence mechanisms in Brucella spp. were investigated. RESULTS: the structureand the interactions between modules involved in these systems were designed, andnovel peptides that can interfere with some of these important mechanisms weredeveloped. CONCLUSION: Since peptide-based therapeutics are a new and evolvingfield due to their ease of production, we hope that peptides developed in thisstudy, as well as the information about the structure and interactions of modulesof persistence mechanisms, can further be used to design drugs against Brucellapersister cells in the hope of restraining the chronic nature of Brucellosis.

TI  - Bioactive synergism between zinc mineral and p-coumaric acid: A multi-modeglycemic control and antioxidative study.
PG  - e14360
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14360 [doi]
AB  - Natural supplements are important in diabetes and oxidative stress management. A complexation-mediated antihyperglycemic and antioxidant synergism betweenzinc(II) and p-coumaric acid was investigated. p-Coumaric acid was complexed withZnSO4 and characterized by FT-IR, (1) H NMR, and mass spectroscopy. Theantioxidant and antihyperglycemic potential of the complex and precursors wereevaluated with different experimental models. Molecular docking with targetproteins linked to diabetes was performed. A Zn(II)-bicoumarate.2H2 O complex wasformed. The in vitro radical scavenging, alpha-glucosidase inhibitory,antiglycation, and anti-lipid peroxidative activities of the complex were severalfolds stronger than p-coumaric acid. In Chang liver cells and rat liver tissues, the complex inhibited lipid peroxidation (IC50 = 56.2 and 398 muM) and GSHdepletion (IC50 = 33.9 and 38.7 muM), which was significantly stronger(2.3-5.4-folds) than p-coumaric acid and comparable to ascorbic acid. Zn(II) and p-coumaric synergistically modulated (1.7- and 2.8-folds than p-coumaric acid)glucose uptake in L-6 myotubes (EC50 = 10.7 muM) and rat muscle tissue (EC50 =428 muM), which may be linked to the observed complexation-mediated increase intissue zinc uptake. Glucose uptake activity was accompanied by increasedhexokinase activity, suggesting increased glucose utilization. Docking scoresalpha-glucosidase, GLUT-4, and PKB/Akt showed stronger interaction with thecomplex (-6.31 to -6.41 kcal/mol) compared to p-coumaric acid (-7.18 to -7.74kcal/mol), which was influenced by the Zn(II) and bicoumarate moieties of thecomplex. In vitro, the complex was not hepatotoxic or myotoxic. Zn(II)complexation may be a therapeutic approach for improving the antioxidative andglycemic control potentials of p-coumaric acid. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Infunctional medicine, natural supplements, plant-derived phenolics, andnutraceuticals are becoming popular in the management of diseases, includingdiabetes and oxidative stress. This has been largely attributed to theirperceived holistic medicinal profile and the absence of notable toxicityconcerns. In the past two decades, considerable attention has been drawn towardzinc mineral as a possible therapeutic supplement for diabetes due to its role ininsulin secretion and reported insulin mimetic potentials. p-Coumaric acid is aknown natural antioxidant with reported diabetes-related pharmacological effects.In this study, we took advantage of these properties and complexed both naturalsupplements, which resulted in a more potent nutraceutical with improved glycemiccontrol and antioxidant potential. The complexation-mediated synergisticinteraction between zinc and p-coumaric acid could be an important therapeuticapproach in improving the use of these natural supplements or nutraceuticals inmanaging diabetes and associated oxidative complications.

TI  - Raman spectroscopy for the differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae: a comparison oftwo methods.
LID - 10.1039/d2an00822j [doi]
AB  - Enterobacteriaceae are the leading cause of urinary tract infections, and includepathogens such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis. Due to theirsimilarity, the correct identification of these pathogens is difficult andtime-consuming. Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated extensively as a toolfor rapid microbiological differentiation. However, for pathogenicEnterobacteriaceae the application of Raman spectroscopy has been particularlychallenging. In this study, two promising methods for Raman-based microbiologicaldiagnostics were compared for differentiating Enterobacteriaceae. Spectra werecollected from single-cells with Raman microspectroscopy and from colonies onagar with an NIR Raman fiber-probe. A comprehensive dataset of spectra from 8different, clinically relevant, genera was collected. Visually, the spectraobtained from both methods presented little difference between the genera. Forclassification, single cell analysis yielded limited results, while thefiber-probe spectra enabled perfect classification of all 16 isolates. Moreover, the model was validated on new replicates and 15/16 strains were correctlyidentified (94% overall accuracy). This is the first study to focus on theclosely related Enterobacteriaceae, who have previously been avoided ordifferentiated poorly. It shows how, with the correct spectroscopic setup, evenchallenging questions in clinical microbiology can be resolved with Ramanspectroscopy, highlighting the method's potential for improving patient care.

PG  - e14372
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14372 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus B10 (L. rhamnosus B10) isolated from the baby feces wasgiven to an alcohol mice model, aiming to investigate the effects of L. rhamnosusB10 on alcoholic liver injury by regulating intestinal microbiota. C57BL/6N mice were fed with liquid diet Lieber-DeCarli with or without 5% (v/v) ethanol for 8weeks, and treated with L. rhamnosus B10 at the last 2 weeks. The results showed that L. rhamnosus B10 decreased the serum total cholesterol (1.48 mmol/L),triglycerides (0.97 mmol/L), alanine aminotransferase (26.4 U/L), aspartateaminotransferase (14.2 U/L), lipopolysaccharide (0.23 EU/mL), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (138 pg/mL). In addition, L. rhamnosus B10 also reduced the livertriglycerides (1.02 mmol/g prot), alanine aminotransferase (17.8 mmol/g prot) andaspartate aminotransferase (12.5 mmol/g prot) in alcohol mice, therebyameliorating alcohol-induced liver injury. The changes of intestinal microbiotacomposition on class, family and genus level in cecum were analyzed. Theintestinal symbiotic abundance of Firmicutes was elevated while gram-negativebacteria Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres was decreased in alcohol mice treatedwith L. rhamnosus B10 for 2 weeks. In summary, this study provided evidence forthe therapeutic effects of probiotics on alcoholic liver injury by regulatingintestinal flora.

AB  - Sindbis virus (SINV) caused a large outbreak in Finland in 2021 with 566laboratory-confirmed human cases and a notable geographical expansion. Comparedwith the last large outbreak in 2002, incidence was higher in several hospitaldistricts but lower in traditionally endemic locations in eastern parts of thecountry. A high incidence is also expected in 2022. Awareness of SINV should beraised in Finland to increase recognition of the disease and prevent transmissionthrough the promotion of control measures.

AB  - Following the report of an excess in paediatric cases of severe acute hepatitisof unknown aetiology by the United Kingdom (UK) on 5 April 2022, 427 cases werereported from 20 countries in the World Health Organization European Region tothe European Surveillance System TESSy from 1 January 2022 to 16 June 2022. Here,we analysed demographic, epidemiological, clinical and microbiological dataavailable in TESSy. Of the reported cases, 77.3% were 5 years or younger and53.5% had a positive test for adenovirus, 10.4% had a positive RT-PCR forSARS-CoV-2 and 10.3% were coinfected with both pathogens. Cases with adenovirusinfections were significantly more likely to be admitted to intensive care orhigh-dependency units (OR=2.11; 95% CI: 1.18-3.74) and transplanted (OR=3.36; 95%CI: 1.19-9.55) than cases with a negative test result for adenovirus, but thiswas no longer observed when looking at this association separately between the UKand other countries. Aetiological studies are needed to ascertain if adenovirusplays a role in this possible emergence of hepatitis cases in children and, ifconfirmed, the mechanisms that could be involved.

TI  - Norovirus Attribution Study: Detection of norovirus from the commercial foodpreparation environment in outbreak and non-outbreak premises.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15761 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Norovirus remains the most significant virological risk that is transmittedvia food and the environment to cause acute gastroenteritis. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the contamination of the commercial foodproduction environment with norovirus will be higher in premises that haverecently reported a foodborne norovirus outbreak than those that have not.METHODS: Sampling of commercial food production environments was carried outacross a 16-month period between January 2015 and April 2016 in the South Eastand the North West of England by local authority environmental health departmentsas part of routine surveillance visits to premises. A total of 2,982 samples,2,038 virological and 944 bacteriological, were collected from 256 premises.Sixteen of these premises, six from South East and ten from North West England,were sampled as part of a public health outbreak investigation. RESULTS &CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 2,038 swabs were submitted for norovirus testing, with anaverage of eight swabs per premises (range 4 to 23) and a median of seven. Of thepremises sampled, 11.7 % (30/256) yielded at least one norovirus positive sample (environmental, and/or food handler hand swab), and 2.5 % of the swabs werepositive for norovirus. A peak in the positivity rate was seen in the South East in April 2016. No associations were found between norovirus positivity andbacteriology indicators, or between bacteriology indicators and hygiene ratings. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates that food premises and food handlers remain a potential source of norovirus transmission and outbreaks.

TI  - Identification of a novel quinoline-based UV-protective pigment from apsychrotrophic Arctic bacterium.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15760 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Psychrotrophs are extremophilic microorganisms that grow optimally in lowtemperature having many unique bioactive molecules of biotechnologicalapplications. In this study we characterized a pigment from an arctic bacteriumwith protective activity towards UV exposure. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presentresearch reports isolation and characterization of a psychrotrophic bacteria,RSAP2, from the soil sample of NyAlesund (78 degrees 56"N, 11 degrees 54"E),Svalbard, Norway. The strain showed closest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity(99.9%) with Kocuria indica NIO-1021. RSAP2 is a Gram-positive, coccoid aerobewhich produces a yellow pigment. The optimal parameters for pigment productionwhile grown in LB medium were 3% (w/v) NaCl and 4 days of incubation of theculture at 20 degrees C and pH 9 with shaking (180 rpm). The pigment wasextracted in methanol and acetone (2:1) and further purified through columnchromatography. It was characterized by mass spectrometry, UV-Visible,fluorescence, IR, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR spectroscopy and CHNS/O -analysis. Thepigment has a molecular weight of about 258 daltons and the molecular formula wasdetermined as C15 H18 N2 O2 and is a quinoline derivative. We show that thepigment can protect E. coli against UV-mediated mutagenesis. We furtherdemonstrate that the pigment displays a significant antimicrobial effect and insublethal concentrations it impairs biofilm formation ability of the modelorganism Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: The pigment of a psychrotrophicArctic bacterium, most likely a strain of K. indica, was purified and itschemical structure was determined. The quinoline-based pigment has the ability toprotect live cells from UV induced damage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY:Analysis and characterization of this newly isolated quinoline-based pigment is apotential candidate for future application in skin care products.

AB  - Hydrogels are functional materials that are similar to human skin and havereceived much attention in recent years for biomedical applications. However, thepreparation of nontoxic, highly adhesive, and antimicrobial hydrogels in anefficient way remains a great challenge. Inspired by adhesive mussel footproteins (mfps) which consist of abundant catecholic amino acids and lysine (Lys)residues, gallic acid-modified epsilon-poly-L-lysine (EPL/GA) was synthesized,and an active functional monomer (AA-EPL/GA) was then created through a reaction with acrylic acid (AA). The polymerization of AA-EPL/GA occurred rapidly (30-160 s) under blue light (lambda = 405 nm) irradiation to produce a biomimeticPAA-EPL/GA hydrogel under mild conditions. The biomimetic pyrogallol-Lysdistribution endowed the PAA-EPL/GA hydrogels with superior adhesion in humidenvironments (with an adhesive strength of 50.02 kPa toward wet porcine skin) andtunable mechanical and self-healing properties. Additionally, the PAA-EPL/GAhydrogels exhibited outstanding antibacterial ability due to the inherentcharacteristics of GA and EPL. In a mouse model, PAA-EPL/GA adhered firmly aroundthe wound tissues. Photographs of the wound and the histological resultsdemonstrated the ability of the hydrogel to promote wound healing, control wound infection, and suppress scar formation. Moreover, the hydrogel had a goodhemostatic effect on liver bleeding. Our results highlighted the promisingapplication potential of GA-based hydrogels, which were easily, harmlessly, andefficiently fabricated by blue light irradiation.

AB  - Tailoring surface properties by layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition directed on theconstruction of complex multilayer coatings with nanoscale precision enables the development of novel structures and devices with desired functional properties(i.e., osseointegration, bactericidal activity, biocorrosion protection). Herein,electrostatic self-assembly was applied to fabricate biopolymer-based coatingsinvolving chitosan (CSM) and alginate (AL) enriched with caffeic acid (CA) onTi-6Al-7Nb alloyed surfaces. The method of CA grafting onto the chitosan backbone(CA-g-CSM) as well as all used reagents for implant functionalization were chosenas green and sustainable approach. The final procedure of surface modification ofthe Ti-6Al-7Nb alloy consists of three steps: (i) chemical treatment in Piranhasolution, (ii) plasma chemical-activation of the Ti alloy surface in a RF CVD(Radio Frequency Chemical Vapour Deposition) reactor using Ar, O2 and NH3 gaseousprecursors, and (iii) a multi-step deposition of bio-functional coatings viadip-coating method. Corrosion tests have revealed that the resultingchitosan-based coatings, also these involving CA, block the specimen surface and hinder corrosion of titanium alloy. Furthermore, the antioxidant layers arecharacterized by beneficial level of roughness (Ra up ca. 350 nm) and moderatehydrophilicity (59 degrees ) with the dispersion part of conducive surface energyca. 30 mJ/m(2). Noteworthy, all coatings are biocompatible as the intactmorphology of cultured eukaryotic cells ensured proper growth and proliferation, while exhibit bacteriostatic character, particularly in contact with Gram-(-)bacteria (E. coli). The study indicates that the applied simple sustainablestrategy has contributed significantly to obtaining homogeneous, stable, andbiocompatible while antibacterial biopolymer-based coatings.

AB  - Since the discovery that nanostructured surfaces were able to kill bacteria, manyworks have been published focusing on the design of nanopatterned surfaces withantimicrobial properties. Synthetic bone grafts, based on calcium phosphate (CaP)formulations, can greatly benefit from this discovery if adequatenanotopographies can be developed. However, CaP are reactive materials andexperience ionic exchanges when placed into aqueous solutions which may in turnaffect cell behaviour and complicate the interpretation of the bactericidalresults. The present study explores the bactericidal potential of twonanopillared CaP prepared by hydrolysis of two different sizes ofalpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP) powders under biomimetic or hydrothermalconditions. A more lethal bactericidal response toward Pseudomonas aeruginosa(~75% killing efficiency of adhered bacteria) was obtained from thehydrothermally treated CaP which consisted in a more irregular topography interms of pillar size (radius: 20-60 nm), interpillar distances (100-1500 nm) and pillar distribution (pillar groups forming bouquets) than the biomimeticallytreated one (radius: 20-40 nm and interpillar distances: 50-200 nm with ahomogeneous pillar distribution). The material reactivity was greatly influenced by the type of medium (nutrient-rich versus nutrient-free) and the presence ornot of bacteria. A lower reactivity and superior bacterial attachment wereobserved in the nutrient-free medium while a lower attachment was observed forthe nutrient rich medium which was explained by a superior reactivity of thematerial paired with the lower tendency of planktonic bacteria to adhere onsurfaces in the presence of nutrients. Importantly, the ionic exchanges produced by the presence of materials were not toxic to planktonic cells. Thus, we canconclude that topography was the main contributor to mortality in the bacterialadhesion tests.

AB  - With the antibiotic crisis intensifies, the defense and treatment of pathogeninfections in safe and effective fashion has become a critical issue. Herein, we report a novel and advanced type of sterilization agent designed via thefunctionalization DNA nanocarriers based on dihydromyricetin and CuO-loadednanoparticles (DNA/DMY-CuO). Firstly, a pure dihydromyricetin (DMY) isolated fromAmpelopsis grossedentata is used as a bridge to the stimulate the construction ofDNA cross-linking networks by hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, a 3D sphericalCuO-loaded nanocomposite (204.39 nm) is customized using the DNA/DMY network as abiological template through a simple coordination-assisted self-assembly method, which exhibits a high dispersibility, water-solubility and physiologicalstability. The reversible physical interactions in nanocarriers allows theselective separation and automatic release of CuO NPs from DNA/DMY-CuO in neutraland wound exudate environments, thereby extending the survival period of CuO NPs by nearly 24 h. Meanwhile, the nanocarriers system relied on the strong bindingability of DMY to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli (E. coli) andStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) achieves controlled drug delivery onto thepathogen wall. The advanced antibacterial action of DNA/DMY-CuO also reflected inmembrane destruction, cytoplasmic constituent leakages and ATP synthetic pathway cessation, thereby halting cytosolic metalloregulatory mechanisms and minimizing drug-resistant bacteria. In summary, such multi-functional CuO-loadednanocomposite provides a water-dispersibility, controllable, low cytotoxicity andlong-effective platform to address the ever-growing threats of bacterialinfections.

AB  - To explore new alternatives to combat increasing risk of bacterial infection, in this work, a cationic antimicrobial peptide (HHC10) and glutathione (GSH)co-ligand protected ultra-small gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) was constructed by asimple one-pot method. The intrinsic luminescent property of GSH-protected Au NCs(AuxGSH) endowed enhanced aggregation-induced emissions (AIEs) ofco-ligand-protected Au NCs (AuxGSH-HHC10), which exhibited a very strong orangeluminescence. Based on the AIE effect, for one thing, AuxGSH could be applied to rapidly and selectively detect Gram-positive bacteria. For another, AuxGSH-HHC10 exhibited potential for multicolor imaging of both Gram-negative andGram-positive bacteria. Besides, as-synthesized AuxGSH-HHC10 could act as potent nanoantibiotics against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, whichcould not only avoid drug tolerance but also be effective toward drug-resistance bacteria. The antibacterial mechanism indicated that the synergetic effect of thegeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), binding with DNA, and broad-spectrumantibacterial activity of HHC10 led to the membrane damage, depolarization, andinterference of biological function, thus enhancing the antibacterial effect.More importantly, such an Au NCs could realize excellent therapeutic outcomes forwound healing in vivo, and showed good biocompatibility and biosafety towardhealth tissues. The results will provide a great potential for the application ofAu NCs for imaging-guided antibacterial platform.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) is a multi-drug resistant bacteriathat pose a serious threat to human health. Antibacterial nanomaterials arebecoming a promising antibiotic substitute or antibiotic adjuvants. In this work,selenium nanowires were modified with nanosilver (Ag NPs) with antibacterialactivity and [Ru(bpy)2dppz](2+) with fluorescent labeling of DNA (SRA), and theantibacterial activity, antibacterial mechanism and biological toxicity of SRAsynergistic antibiotics were studied. In vitro, antibacterial results show thatSRA (12 mug/mL) improves the antibacterial activity of various antibioticsagainst resistant bacteria and significantly slows the development of bacterialresistance to antibiotics. Studies on antibacterial mechanisms have shown thatSRA synergistic antibiotics destroy drug-resistant bacteria through a combinationof physical (physical damage) and chemical pathways (destruction of biofilm,membrane depolarization, cell membrane destruction, adenosine triphosphateconsumption and reactive oxygen species production). Transcriptomics analysisfound that SRA affects bacterial activity by affecting bacterial biosynthesis,ATP synthesis and biofilm formation. Furthermore, SRA synergistic antibiotics canaccelerate wound healing of bacterial infection by reducing the inflammatoryresponse. The toxicity evaluation results show that SRA has extremely lowcellular and in vivo toxicity. SRA has the potential of clinical application asmultiple antibiotic adjuvants to deal with resistant bacterial infections.

AB  - Osteomyelitis is a potentially devastating inflammatory bone disease that leadsto bone destruction and loss. Treatment of osteomyelitis requires the removal of residual bacteria as well as osteogenesis with angiogenesis at the site oftreatment. Use of an appropriate amount of copper (Cu) in treatment scaffolds mayachieve these goals without the risk of toxicity. In this study, the surface ofthe carbonate apatite honeycomb scaffold was functionalized with Cu through adissolution-precipitation reaction. The resulting scaffolds retained thehoneycomb structure after immersion in CuCl2 solution, and Cu was precipitated onthe surface as libethenite [Cu2(OH)PO4]. The surface Cu concentration wascontrolled by the concentration of the CuCl2 solution. Scaffolds with a surfaceCu concentration of 23.8 wt% exhibited antibacterial and cytotoxic effects,whereas those with concentrations of </=4.6 wt% exerted antibacterial effectswithout negatively affecting the cellular adhesion, proliferation,differentiation, and calcification of osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore,scaffolds with a surface Cu concentration of 4.6 wt% Cu inhibited bacterialgrowth for at least 28 days and displayed proangiogenic and pro-osteogenicactivities in vivo. These data confirm the success in functionalizing scaffoldswith Cu that may be utilized as an innovative osteomyelitis therapy.

AB  - Streptococcus mutans is one of the bacteria that initiates the colonization ofthe pellicle at the tooth surface. It forms a plaque, together with otherbacteria, which gradually dissolves the pellicle and leaves the tooth surfaceunprotected against the acidic oral environment. Calcium phosphate ceramics areexcellent synthetic materials for the study of biofilm formation in dentistrybecause they are comparable to teeth in chemical composition and structure.Calcium phosphates can be processed to achieve a variety of crystalline compoundswith biologically relevant ionic substitutions and structures that allow study ofthe effect of the surface chemistry and the topography independently. In thisarticle, we describe the preparation and characterization of three types ofcalcium phosphate-based materials as a suitable surface for the formation of the S. mutans biofilm: beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP); sintered hydroxyapatite (SHA); and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA). The densest biofilms wereformed on the surfaces of SHA and CDHA, with no significant differences due tothe stoichiometry or microstructure. In contrast, beta-TCP showed a lowersusceptibility to S. mutans biofilm formation, suggesting that the crystallinestructure is the controlling parameter. Subsequently, SHA was selected to developa dental biofilm model that allowed study of S. mutans biofilm susceptibility to chlorhexidine and ethanol.

AB  - The rapid development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and biofilm-relatedinfections (BRIs) has urgently called for new strategies to combat severeorthopaedic device-related infections (ODRIs). Antimicrobial coating has emerged as a promising strategy in halting the incidence of ODRIs and treating ODRIs inlong term. With the advancement of material science and biotechnology, numerousantimicrobial coatings have been reported in literature, showing superiorantimicrobial and osteogenic functions. This review has specifically discussedthe currently developed antimicrobial coatings in the perspective of drug releasefrom the coating system, focusing on their realization of controlled and ondemand antimicrobial agents release, as well as multi-functionality.Acknowledging the multidisciplinary nature of antimicrobial coating, theconceptual design, the deposition method and the therapeutic effect of theantimicrobial coatings have been described in detail and discussed critically.Particularly, the challenges and opportunities on the way toward the clinicaltranslation of antimicrobial coatings have been highlighted.

AB  - Oral wounds are among the most troublesome injuries which easily affect thepatients' quality of life. To date, the development of functional antibacterialdressings for oral wound healing remains a challenge. In this regard, weinvestigated antibacterial silk protein-based membranes for the application aswound dressings in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The present study includesfive variants of casted membranes, i.e., i) membranes-silver nanoparticles(CM-Ag), ii) membranes-gentamicin (CM-G), iii) membranes-control (withoutfunctionalization) (CM-C), iv) membranes-silk sericin control (CM-SSC), and v)membranes-silk fibroin/silk sericin (CM-SF/SS), and three variants of nonwovens, i.e., i) silver nanoparticles (NW-Ag), ii) gentamicin (NW-G), iii) control(without functionalization) (NW-C). The surface structure of the samples wasvisualized with scanning electron microscopy. In addition, antibacterial testing was accomplished using agar diffusion assay, colony forming unit (CFU) analysis, and qrt-PCR. Following antibacterial assays, biocompatibility was evaluated bycell proliferation assay (XTT), cytotoxicity assay (LDH), and live-dead assay on L929 mouse fibroblasts. Findings indicated significantly lower bacterial colonygrowth and DNA counts for CM-Ag with a reduction of bacterial counts by 3loglevels (99.9% reduction) in CFU and qrt-PCR assay compared to untreated controlmembranes (CM-C and CM-SSC) and membranes functionalized with gentamicin (CM-Gand NW-G) (p < 0.001). Similarly, NW-G yielded significantly lower DNA and colonygrowth counts compared to NW-Ag and NW-C (p < 0.001). In conclusion, CM-Agrepresented 1log level better antibacterial activity compared to NW-G, whereasNW-G showed better cytocompatibility for L929 cells. As data suggest, these twomembranes have the potential of application in the field of bacteria-free oralwound healing. However, provided that loading strategy and cytocompatibility are adjusted according to the antibacterial agents' characteristic and fabricationtechnique of the membranes.

TI  - Putative transcription antiterminator RfaH contributes to Erwinia amylovoravirulence.
LID - 10.1111/mpp.13254 [doi]
AB  - The gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease of appleand pear trees. The exopolysaccharide amylovoran and lipopolysaccharides areessential E. amylovora virulence factors. Production of amylovoran andlipopolysaccharide is specified in part by genes that are members of longoperons. Here, we show that full virulence of E. amylovora in apple fruitlets andtree shoots depends on the predicted transcription antiterminator RfaH. RfaHreduces pausing in the production of long transcripts having an operon polaritysuppressor regulatory element within their promoter region. In E. amylovora, onlythe amylovoran operon and a lipopolysaccharide operon have such regulatoryelements within their promoter regions and in the correct orientation. Theseoperons showed dramatically increased polarity in the DeltarfaH mutant comparedto the wild type as determined by RNA sequencing. Amylovoran andlipopolysaccharide production in vitro was reduced in rfaH mutants compared tothe wild type, which probably contributes to the rfaH mutant virulence phenotype.Furthermore, type VI secretion cluster 1, which contributes to E. amylovoravirulence, showed reduced expression in DeltarfaH compared to the wild type,although without an increase in polarity. The data suggest that E. amylovora RfaHdirectly, specifically, and exclusively suppresses operon polarity in theamylovoran operon and a lipopolysaccharide operon.

TI  - An LCO-responsive homolog of NODULE INCEPTION positively regulates lateral rootformation in Populus sp.
LID - kiac356 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiac356 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) has been studied extensively for its multiple roles in root nodule symbiosis within plants of the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC) that associate with soil bacteria, such as rhizobia and Frankia.However, NIN homologs are present in plants outside the NFC, suggesting a role inother developmental processes. Here, we show that the biofuel crop Populus sp.,which is not part of the NFC, contains eight copies of NIN with diversifiedprotein sequence and expression patterns. Lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) areproduced by rhizobia and a wide range of fungi, including mycorrhizal ones, andact as symbiotic signals that promote lateral root formation. RNAseq analysis of Populus sp. treated with purified LCO showed induction of the PtNIN2 subfamily.Moreover, the expression of PtNIN2b correlated with the formation of lateralroots and was suppressed by cytokinin treatment. Constitutive expression ofPtNIN2b overcame the inhibition of lateral root development by cytokinin underhigh nitrate conditions. Lateral root induction in response to LCOs likelyrepresents an ancestral function of NIN retained and repurposed in nodulatingplants, as we demonstrate that the role of NIN in LCO-induced root branching isconserved in both Populus sp. and legumes. We further established a visual markerof LCO perception in Populus sp. roots, the putative sulfotransferase PtSS1, thatcan be used to study symbiotic interactions with the bacterial and fungalsymbionts of Populus sp.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trichoderma spp. are filamentous fungi causing invasive fungaldiseases in patients with haematological malignancies and in peritoneal dialysis patients. OBJECTIVES: To analyse clinical presentation, predisposing factors,treatment and outcome of Trichoderma infections. METHODS: A systematic literaturereview was conducted for published cases of invasive Trichoderma infection inPubMed until December 2021 and by reviewing the included studies' references.Cases from the FungiScope(R) registry were added to a combined analysis. RESULTS:We identified 50 invasive infections due to Trichoderma species, including 11 in the FungiScope(R) registry. The main underlying conditions were haematologicalmalignancies in 19 and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in 10cases. The most prevalent infection sites were lung (42%) and peritoneum (22%).Systemic antifungal therapy was administered in 42 cases (84%), mostlyamphotericin B (n = 27, lipid-based formulation 13/27) and voriconazole in 15cases (30%). Surgical interventions were performed in 13 cases (26%). Overallmortality was 48% (n = 24) and highest for allogeneic HSCT and solid organtransplantation (SOT) recipients [80% (4/5) and 77% (7/9), respectively]. Inpatients treated with amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin, mortality was55% (15/27), 46% (7/15) and 28% (2/7), respectively. Three out of four patientstreated with a combination therapy of voriconazole and caspofungin survived.CONCLUSIONS: Despite treatment with antifungal therapies and surgery, invasiveTrichoderma infections are life-threatening complications in immunocompromisedpatients, especially after HSCT and SOT. In addition, Trichoderma spp. mainlyaffect the lungs in patients with haematological malignancies and the peritoneum in CAPD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the origin of a Serratia marcescens outbreak in aneonatal intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: Regional level 3 perinatal center in Germany. PATIENTS: This study included 4 S. marcescens-positive and 19 S. marcescens-negative neonates treated betweenFebruary 1 and February 26, 2019, in the neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: Acase-control study was performed to identify the source of the outbreak. Themolecular investigation of S. marcescens isolates collected during the outbreakwas performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and next-generationsequencing. RESULTS: The retrospective case-control study showed a significantcorrelation (P < .0001) between S. marcensens infection or colonization andconsumption of donor milk that had tested negative for pathogenic bacteria from asingle breast milk donor. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and next-generationsequencing retrospectively confirmed an S. marcescens strain isolated from thebreast milk of this donor as the possible origin of the initial outbreak. Theoutbreak was controlled by the implementation of an infection control bundleincluding a multidisciplinary infection control team, temporary nutrition ofinfants with formula only and/or their mother's own milk, repeated screening ofall inpatients, strict coat and glove care, process observation, retraining ofhand hygiene and continuous monitoring of environmental cleaning procedures.CONCLUSIONS: Low-level contaminated raw donor milk can be a source of infectionand colonization of preterm infants with S. marcescens even if it tests negative for bacteria.

AB  - Ureteral stents are commonly utilized as a medical device to aid the flow ofurine. However, biofilm formation and encrustation complications have beenclinical problems. To overcome this challenge, heparin/poly-L-lysine-copper(Hep/PLL-Cu) nanoparticle was immobilized on a dopamine-coated polyurethanesurface (PU/NPs). The stability and structural properties of the nanoparticleswere characterized by Zeta potential, poly dispersion index, transmissionelectron microscopy, atom force microscopy and contact angle. The surfacecomposition, antibacterial potency, encrustation resistance rate andbiocompatibility of PU/NPs were investigated by scanning electron microscope,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, antibacterial assay and MTS assay,respectively. In addition, the anti-encrustation property was studied byimplanting coated NPs stents in the rat bladder for 7 days. It was shown that thesize and distribution of Hep/PLL-Cu nanoparticles were uniform. PU/NPs couldinhibit Proteus mirabilis proliferation and biofilm formation, and exhibit nocytotoxicity. Less encrustation (Ca and Mg salt) was deposited both in vitro and in vivo on samples, demonstrating that the NPs coating could be a potentialsurface modification method of ureteral material for clinical use.

AB  - Oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of multiple healthcomplications, and it has become a major focus in targeted research fields. Asknown, black seeds are rich sources of bio-active compounds and widely used topromote human health due to their excellent medicinal and pharmaceuticalproperties. The present study investigated the antioxidant potency of variousblack seeds from plants and their derived mycoendophytes, and determined thetotal phenolic and flavonoid contents in different extracts, followed bycharacterization of major constituents by HPLC analysis. Finally, in silicodocking determined their binding affinities to target myeloperoxidase enzymes.Ten dominant mycoendophytes were isolated from different black seed plants. Threeisolates were then selected based on high antiradical potency and furtheridentified by ITS ribosomal gene sequencing. Those isolated were Aspergillusniger TU 62, Chaetomium madrasense AUMC14830, and Rhizopus oryzae AUMC14823.Nigella sativa seeds and their corresponding endophyte A. niger had the highestcontent of phenolics in their n-butanol extracts (28.50 and 24.43 mg/g),flavonoids (15.02 and 11.45 mg/g), and antioxidant activities (90.48 and 81.48%),respectively, followed by Dodonaea viscosa and Portulaca oleracea along withtheir mycoendophytic R. oryzae and C. madrasense. Significant positivecorrelations were found between total phenolics, flavonoids, and the antioxidant activities of different tested extracts. The n-butanol extracts of both blackseeds and their derived mycoendophytes showed reasonable IC50 values (0.81-1.44mg/ml) compared to the control with significant correlations among theirphytochemical contents. Overall, seventeen standard phenolics and flavonoids wereused, and the compounds were detected in different degrees of existence andconcentration in the examined extracts through HPLC analysis. Moreover, theinvestigation of the molecular simulation results of detected compounds againstthe myeloperoxidase enzyme revealed that, as a targeted antioxidant, rutinpossessed a high affinity (-15.3184 kcal/mol) as an inhibitor. Taken together,the black seeds and their derived mycoendophytes are promising bio-prospects for the broad industrial sector of antioxidants with several valuable potentialpharmaceutical and nutritional applications.

LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.943692 [doi]
AB  - Exploring an efficient and green pretreatment method is an important prerequisitefor the development of biorefinery. It is well known that locusts can degradegramineous lignocellulose efficiently. Locusts can be used as a potentialresource for studying plant cell wall degradation, but there are few relativestudies about locusts so far. Herein, some new discoveries were revealed aboutelucidating the process of biodegradation of gramineous lignocellulose in Locustamigratoria manilensis. The enzyme activity related to lignocellulose degradation and the content of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the different gutsegments of locusts fed corn leaves were measured in this study. A series ofcharacterization analyses were conducted on corn leaves and locust feces, whichincluded field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), andthermogravimetric (TG) analysis. These results showed that the highest activitiesof carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), filter paper cellulase (FPA), and xylanasewere obtained in the foregut of locusts, which strongly indicated that theforegut was the main lignocellulose degradation segment in locusts; furthermore, the majority of nutritional components were absorbed in the midgut of locusts.The activity of CMCase was significantly higher than that of xylanase, andmanganese peroxidase (MnPase) activity was lowest, which might be due to thebasic nutrition of locusts being cellulose and hemicellulose and not lignin basedon the results of FE-SEM, FTIR, XRD, and TG analysis. Overall, these resultsprovided a valuable insight into lignocellulosic degradation mechanisms forunderstanding gramineous plant cell wall deconstruction and recalcitrance inlocusts, which could be useful in the development of new enzymatic pretreatmentprocesses mimicking the locust digestive system for the biochemical conversion oflignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals.

AB  - Aims: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a progressive heart disease that isparticularly prevalent in elderly patients. The current treatment of CAVD issurgical valve replacement, but this is not a permanent solution, and it is very challenging for elderly patients. Thus, a pharmacological intervention for CAVDmay be beneficial. In this study, we intended to rescue aortic valve (AV)calcification through inhibition of TGFbeta1 and SMAD3 signaling pathways.Methods and Results: The klotho gene, which was discovered as an aging-suppressorgene, has been observed to play a crucial role in AV calcification. The klothoknockout (Kl (-/-)) mice have shorter life span (8-12 weeks) and develop severeAV calcification. Here, we showed that increased TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta-dependentSMAD3 signaling were associated with AV calcification in Kl (-/-) mice. Next, we generated Tgfb1- and Smad3-haploinsufficient Kl (-/-) mice to determine thecontribution of TGFbeta1 and SMAD3 to the AV calcification in Kl (-/-) mice. The histological and morphometric evaluation suggested a significant reduction of AV calcification in Kl (-/-); Tgfb1 (+/-) mice compared to Kl (-/-) mice. Smad3heterozygous deletion was observed to be more potent in reducing AV calcificationin Kl (-/-) mice compared to the Kl (-/-); Tgfb1 (+/-) mice. We observedsignificant inhibition of Tgfb1, Pai1, Bmp2, Alk2, Spp1, and Runx2 mRNAexpression in Kl (-/-); Tgfb1 (+/-) and Kl (-/-); Smad3 (+/-) mice compared to Kl(-/-) mice. Western blot analysis confirmed that the inhibition of TGFbetacanonical and non-canonical signaling pathways were associated with the rescue ofAV calcification of both Kl (-/-); Tgfb1 (+/-) and Kl (-/-); Smad3 (+/-) mice.Conclusion: Overall, inhibition of the TGFbeta1-dependent SMAD3 signaling pathwaysignificantly blocks the development of AV calcification in Kl (-/-) mice. Thisinformation is useful in understanding the signaling mechanisms involved in CAVD.

AB  - Phytopathogenic fungi are serious threats in the agriculture sector especially infruit and vegetable production. The use of plant essential oil as antifungalagents has been in practice from many years. Plant essential oils (PEOs) ofCuminum cyminum, Trachyspermum ammi, Azadirachta indica, Syzygium aromaticum,Moringa oleifera, Mentha spicata, Eucalyptus grandis, Allium sativum, and Citrus sinensis were tested against Fusarium oxysporum. Three phase trials consist oflab testing (MIC and MFC), field testing (seed treatment and foliar spray), andcomputer-aided fungicide design (CAFD). Two concentrations (25 and 50 mul/ml)have been used to asses MIC while MFC was assessed at four concentrations (25,50, 75, and 100 mul/ml). C. sinensis showed the largest inhibition zone (47.5 and46.3 m(2)) for both concentrations. The lowest disease incidence and diseaseseverity were recorded in treatments with C. sinensis PEO. Citrus sinensis thatqualified in laboratory and field trials was selected for CAFD. The chemicalcompounds of C. sinensis PEO were docked with polyketide synthase beta-ketoacylsynthase domain of F. oxysporum by AutoDock Vina. The best docked complex wasformed by nootkatone with -6.0 kcal/mol binding affinity. Pharmacophore of thetop seven C. sinensis PEO compounds was used for merged pharmacophore generation.The best pharmacophore model with 0.8492 score was screened against the CMNPdatabase. Top hit compounds from screening were selected and docked withpolyketide synthase beta-ketoacyl synthase domain. Four compounds with thehighest binding affinity and hydrogen bonding were selected for confirmation oflead molecule by doing MD simulation. The polyketide synthase-CMNPD24498 showedthe highest stability throughout 80 ns run of MD simulation. CMNPD24498 (FW054-1)from Verrucosispora was selected as the lead compound against F. oxysporum.

AB  - Life expectancy of multiple myeloma (MM) patients has improved in last years due to the advent of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies in combination withimmunomodulators and proteasome inhibitors. However, morbidity and mortalityrelated to infections remain high and represent a major concern. This paperdescribes the "real life" risk of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in patientstreated with daratumumab-based therapy and reviews the relevant literature. In a series of 75 patients we only observed three cases of fungal pneumonia.Unfortunately, the early signs and symptoms were not specific for fungalinfection. Diagnostic imaging, microbiology and patient history, especiallyprevious therapies, are critical in the decision to start antifungal treatment.Recognising the subgroup of MM patients with high risk of IFI can increase therate of diagnosis, adequate treatment and MM-treatment recovery.

AB  - Lead (Pb) exposure during early life has been associated with an increased riskof neurodevelopmental disorders, including learning and memory deficits. Theintestinal flora, via the microbiome-gut-brain axis, could play a significantrole in the nervous system. However, the effects of probiotics on amelioratingPb-induced learning and memory deficits are still unclear. In this study, weshowed that adolescent Pb exposure (150 ppm) for 2 months impaired spatiallearning and memory ability, accompanied by the decreasing diversity of gutmicrobiota, and the decreasing abundance of Lactobacillus at the genus level.Surprisingly, administration of the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 (10(10)organisms/rat/day), not L. rhamnosus LGG or Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, reversedlearning and memory deficits induced by Pb exposure. Meanwhile, administration ofthe L. rhamnosus GR-1 increased the diversity of the gut microbiota compositionand partially normalized the genus level of Lactobacillus, Parabacteroides,Enterococcus, and Akkermansia in Pb-exposed rats. Notably, supplementation of L. rhamnosus GR-1 decreased the gut permeability of Pb-exposed rats, reducedproinflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6] expression, andpromoted anti-inflammatory cytokines [granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF)] expression. Interestingly, neural cell treatment with G-CSF rescuedPb-induced neurotoxicity. In general, L. rhamnosus GR-1 supplementation recoveredthe Pb-induced loss of intestinal bacteria (Lactobacillus), which may havereversed the damage to learning and memory ability. Collectively, our findingsdemonstrate an unexpectedly pivotal role of L. rhamnosus GR-1 in Pb-inducedcognitive deficits and identify a potential probiotic therapy for cognitivedysfunction during early life.

AB  - Dysbiosis of gut microbiota can contribute to the progression of diabetes andobesity. Previous studies have shown that maternal high-fat (HF) diet during the perinatal period can alter the microbiota and induce metabolic disorders atweaning. However, whether dysbiosis of gut microbiota and metabolism could berecovered by a normal diet after weaning and the dynamic changes of gutmicrobiota have not been fully studied. In this study, C57BL/6J female mice were fed with a normal chow (NC) or HF diet for 4 weeks preconception, duringgestation, and until pup weaning. After weaning, male offspring were fed with an NC diet until 9 weeks of age. The microbiota of offspring at weaning and 9 weeks of age was collected for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that damsfed with an HF diet showed glucose intolerance after lactation. Compared with theoffspring from NC dams, the offspring from HF dams exhibited a higher bodyweight, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia,hypercholesterolemia, and leptin resistance and lower adiponectin at weaning.Fecal analysis indicated altered microbiota composition between the offspring of the two groups. The decrease in favorable bacteria (such as norank fBacteroidales S24-7 group) and increase in unfavorable bacteria (such asLachnoclostridium and Desulfovibrio) were strongly associated with a disturbance of glucose and lipid metabolism. After 6 weeks of normal diet, no difference inbody weight, glucose, and lipid profiles was observed between the offspring ofthe two groups. However, the microbiota composition of offspring in the HF group was still different from that in the NC group, and microbiota diversity was lowerin offspring of the HF group. The abundance of Lactobacillus was lower in theoffspring of the HF group. In conclusion, a maternal HF diet can induce metabolichomeostasis and gut microbiota disturbance in offspring at weaning. Gutmicrobiota dysbiosis can persist into adulthood in the offspring, which mighthave a role in the promotion of susceptibility to obesity and diabetes in thelater life of the offspring.

AB  - Background: At present, fish meal (FM) resources are in short supply, andcompetition for food between humans and animals is becoming increasinglycritical. Finding non-grain protein sources that can replace FM is the key tosolving the rapid development of aquaculture. Methods: Seven trial diets wereprepared with 0 g/kg (EP0), 30 g/kg (EP3), 60 g/kg (EP6), 90 g/kg (EP9), 120 g/kg(EP12), 150 g/kg (EP15), and 180 g/kg (EP18) of enzyme-digested poultryby-product meal (EPBM) by replacing of FM. A total of 630 hybrid groupers(Epinephelus fuscoguttatus female symbol x E. lanceolatus male symbol) wereequally portioned into 21 tanks. At 8:00 and 16:00 each day, groupers were feduntil they were full for a cumulative period of 8 weeks. Results: The resultsshowed that 30 g/kg of EPBM significantly increased the rates of weight gain and special growth (P < 0.05). Significantly higher activities of serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, catalase, and superoxidedismutase were observed in the EP3 group (P < 0.05). The categories and numbersof the top 10 dominant bacteria in the phylum and genus levels were notsignificantly influenced by feed (P > 0.05). In the proximal intestine and distalintestine, there were significantly higher expressions of SNAT3, LAAT1, CAT2, andCAT1 in the EP3 group compared with the EP0 group (P < 0.05). In the EP3 group,the expressions of PepT1, LAAT1, B(0, +)AT, and CAT2 were significantly increasedin MI than those in all other groups (except the EP0 group, P < 0.05).Conclusion: When FM was replaced by 30 g/kg of EPBM, growth performance,antioxidant capacity, and the ability to transport amino acids and peptides ofhybrid grouper were significantly improved.

AB  - Anthocyanins (ACNs) are plant polyphenols that have received increased attention recently mainly due to their potential health benefits and applications asfunctional food ingredients. This has also created an interest in the developmentand validation of several non-destructive techniques of ACN assessments inseveral food samples. Non-destructive and conventional techniques play animportant role in the assessment of ACNs in agricultural and food products.Although conventional methods appear to be more accurate and specific in theiranalysis, they are also associated with higher costs, the destruction of samples,time-consuming, and require specialized laboratory equipment. In this reviewarticle, we present the latest findings relating to the use of severalspectroscopic techniques (fluorescence, Raman, Nuclear magnetic resonancespectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and near-infraredspectroscopy), hyperspectral imaging, chemometric-based machine learning, andartificial intelligence applications for assessing the ACN content inagricultural and food products. Furthermore, we also propose technical and futureadvancements of the established techniques with the need for further developmentsand technique amalgamations.

AB  - Metabolic disorders are the prelude of metabolic diseases, which are mainly dueto the high-energy intake and genetic contribution. High-fat diet (HFD) orhigh-sucrose diet is widely used for inducing metabolic disorders characterizedby increased body weight, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and alterationof gut microbiome. However, the triangle relationship among diets, gutmicrobiome, and host metabolism is poorly understood. In our study, weinvestigated the dynamic changes in gut microbiota, and host metabolism in micethat were fed with either chow diet, HFD, or chow diet with 30% sucrose indrinking water (HSD) for continued 12 weeks. The gut microbiota was analyzed with16S rDNA sequencing on feces. Hepatic gene expression profile was tested withtranscriptomics analysis on liver tissue. The host metabolism was evaluated bymeasuring body weight, insulin sensitivity, serum lipids, and expression ofproteins involved in lipid metabolism of liver. The results showed that HFDfeeding affected body weight, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis moresignificantly than HSD feeding. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that HFD rapidly and steadily suppressed species richness, altered microbiota structure andfunction, and increased the abundance of bacteria responsible for fatty acidmetabolism and inflammatory signaling. In contrast, HSD had minor impact on theoverall bacteria structure or function but activated microbial bile acidbiosynthesis. Fecal microbiota transplantation suggested that some metabolicchanges induced by HFD or HSD feeding were transferrable, especially in theweight of white adipose tissue and hepatic triglyceride level that wereconsistent with the phenotypes in donor mice. Moreover, transcriptomic resultsshowed that HFD feeding significantly inhibited fatty acid degradation andincrease inflammation, while HSD increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis andinhibited primary bile acid synthesis alternative pathway. In general, our study revealed the dynamic and diversified impacts of HFD and HSD on gut microbiota andhost metabolism.

AB  - Bidirectional cross-talk between commensal microbiota and the immune system isessential for the regulation of immune responses and the formation ofimmunological memory. Perturbations of microbiome-immune system interactions can lead to dysregulated immune responses against invading pathogens and/or to theloss of self-tolerance, leading to systemic inflammation and genesis of severalimmune-mediated pathologies, including neurodegeneration. In this paper, we firstinvestigated the contribution of the immunomodulatory effects of microbiota(bacteria and fungi) in shaping immune responses and influencing the formation ofimmunological memory cells using a network-based bioinformatics approach. Inaddition, we investigated the possible role of microbiota-host-immune systeminteractions and of microbiota-virus interactions in a group of neurodegenerativediseases (NDs): Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS),Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our analysis highlightedvarious aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response systems that can bemodulated by microbiota, including the activation and maturation of microgliawhich are implicated in the development of NDs. It also led to the identificationof specific microbiota components which might be able to influence immune system processes (ISPs) involved in the pathogenesis of NDs. In addition, it indicatedthat the impact of microbiota-derived metabolites in influencingdisease-associated ISPs, is higher in MS disease, than in AD, PD and ALSsuggesting a more important role of microbiota mediated-immune effects in MS.

AB  - The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway is an important innate immune signaling cascaderesponsible for the sensing of abnormal cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA),which is a hallmark of infection or cancers. Recently, tremendous progress hasbeen made in the understanding of the STING activation mechanism from variousaspects. In this review, the molecular mechanism of activation of STING proteinbased on its structural features is briefly discussed. The underlying molecularmechanism of STING activation will enable us to develop novel therapeutics totreat STING-associated diseases and understand how STING has evolved to eliminateinfection and maintain immune homeostasis in innate immunity.

AB  - Brucellosis, caused by Brucella spp., is one of the most widespread bacterialzoonoses worldwide. Vaccination is still considered the best way to controlbrucellosis. An investigation into the differential proteome expression patterns of wild and vaccine strains may help researchers and clinicians differentiatebetween the strains to diagnose and better understand the mechanism(s) underlyingdifferences in virulence. In the present study, a mass spectrometry-based,label-free relative quantitative proteomics approach was used to investigate the proteins expressed by the wild strain, B. melitensis biovar 3 and compare it withthose expressed by B. melitensis M5-90. The higher level of virulence for B.melitensis biovar 3 compared to B. melitensis M5-90 was validated in vitro and invivo. A total of 2133 proteins, encompassing 68% of the theoretical proteome,were identified and quantified by proteomic analysis, resulting in broad coverageof the B. melitensis proteome. A total of 147 proteins were identified asdifferentially expressed (DE) between these two strains. In addition, 9 proteins and 30 proteins were identified as unique to B. melitensis M5-90 and B.melitensis biovar 3, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that the majority ofthe DE proteins were involved in iron uptake, quorum sensing, pyrimidinemetabolism, glycine betaine biosynthetic and metabolic processes,thiamine-containing compound metabolism and ABC transporters. The expression ofBtpA and VjbR proteins (two well-known virulence factors) in B. melitensis biovar3 was 8-fold and 2-fold higher than in B. melitensis M5-90. In summary, ourresults identified many unique proteins that could be selected as candidatemarkers for differentiating vaccinated animals from animals with wild-typeinfections. BtpA and VjbR proteins might be responsible for the residualvirulence of B. melitensis M5-90, while ABC transporters and thiamine metabolism associated proteins may be newly identified Brucella virulence factors. All ofthe identified DE proteins provide valuable information for the development ofvaccines and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - To establish a mouse model of weak depression, we raised 6-week-old C57BL/6N micein single (SH) or group housing (GH) conditions for 2 weeks. The SH group showed less social interaction with stranger mice, learning disability in behavioraltests, and lower plasma corticosterone levels. The cecal microbiota of the SHgroup showed significant segregation from the GH group in the principalcoordinate analysis (PCoA). Transcriptome analysis of the amygdala and liverdetected multiple differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In the amygdala of SHmice, suppression of the cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP) signal was predictedand confirmed by the reduced immunoreactivity of phosphorylated cAMP-responsiveelement-binding protein. In the liver of SH mice, downregulation ofbeta-oxidation was predicted. Interestingly, the expression levels of over 100DEGs showed a significant correlation with the occupancy of two bacterial genera,Lactobacillus (Lactobacillaceae) and Anaerostipes (Lachnospiraceae). Thesebacteria-correlated DEGs included JunB, the downstream component of cAMPsignaling in the amygdala, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a), a keyenzyme of beta-oxidation in the liver. This trans-omical analysis also suggested that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis in the liver may be linkedto the occupancy of Lactobacillus through the regulation of nicotinamidephosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and kynureninase (KYNU) genes. Our resultssuggested that SH condition along with the presence of correlated bacteriaspecies causes weak depression phenotype in young mice and provides a suitablemodel to study food ingredient that is able to cure weak depression.

AB  - Background and Aim: There have been contradictory reports about the associationbetween Helicobacter pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Based on the high frequency of H. pylori infection in Cameroon, we have evaluated thefrequency of H. pylori infection as the cause of anemia, and IDA among dyspeptic patients in Cameroon. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 842 dyspeptic patients (472 women and 370 men) in two reference hospitals in Douala-Cameroon.Each participant gave a written consent, and the study was approved by theNational Ethical Committee. Erythroid-related indices and markers of irondeficiency (ID) measurement were done for each participant as well as H. pyloridetection. Data were analyzed using SSPS statistical package. Results: Theprevalence of anemia, ID, IDA, and H. pylori infection was 65.08%, 31.47%,25.65%, and 80.88%, respectively. H. pylori infected individuals had asignificantly lower mean value of hemoglobin (P = 0.01), hematocrit (P = 0.04),ferritin (P = 0.03) and coefficient of transferrin saturation (CTS) levels (P =0.04) and a significantly higher mean value of mean corpuscular hemoglobinconcentration (MCHC) (P = 0.02). Compared with H. pylori non-infectedparticipants, H. pylori infected patients were 1.2938 (95% confidence interval[CI]: 0.9087-1.8421), 1.1851 (95% CI: 0.8122-1.7292), and 1.5636 (95% CI:1.0206-2.3953) times at higher risk to develop anemia, ID, and IDA, respectively.A significant relationship was found between H. pylori infection and IDA (P =0.04 and 0.04 for crude and age/sex-adjusted, respectively). Conclusion: H.pylori infection seems to be associated with anemia, and IDA among dyspepticpatients in our milieu.

PG  - L6-L8
LID - 10.1530/RAF-22-0026 [doi]
AB  - The need to develop new treatments to prevent unprompted premature deliverybefore 37 weeks of pregnancy remains pressing and unmet. Bacteria (Lactobacillus species) that promote vaginal health produce biochemical compounds that preventthe growth of microbes such as Gardnerella vaginalis. Overgrowth of G. vaginalis can cause vaginal infection with smelly discharge and increase a woman's risk of sexually transmitted infections and premature delivery. In this study, weexamined how normal health-promoting (L. crispatus) and potentially harmful (G.vaginalis) vaginal bacteria interact in a laboratory setting. This was in orderto observe natural and effective agent(s) from L. crispatus that can hinder thegrowth of G. vaginalis and accompanying immune response. We observed that L.crispatus clears G. vaginalis by itself and with several biochemical compoundsthat it produces. Such biochemical compounds can be developed into treatment for vaginal infections and premature delivery due to infection and inappropriateimmune response.

TI  - The Pharmacologically Active Alkaloid Cryptolepine Activates a Type 1 Interferon Response That Is Independent of MAVS and STING Pathways.
PG  - 8873536
LID - 10.1155/2022/8873536 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 interferons (IFN-1) are pleiotropic cytokines with well-establishedanticancer and antiviral properties, particularly in mucosal tissues. Hence,natural IFN-1-inducing treatments are highly sought after in the clinic. Here, wereport for the first time that cryptolepine, a pharmacoactive alkaloid in themedicinal plant Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, is a potent IFN-1 pathway inducer.Cryptolepine increased the transcript levels of JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, IRF9,and OAS3, as well as increased the accumulation of STAT1 and OAS3 proteins,similar to recombinant human IFN-alpha. Cryptolepine effects were observed inmultiple cell types including a model of human macrophages. This response wasmaintained in MAVS and STING-deficient cell lines, suggesting that cryptolepineeffects are not mediated by nucleic acids released upon nuclear or organelledamage. In agreement, cryptolepine did not affect cell viability inconcentrations that triggered potent IFN-1 activation. In addition, we observedno differences in the presence of a pharmacological inhibitor of TBK1, apleiotropic kinase that is a converging point for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleic acid sensors. Together, our results demonstrate that cryptolepine is astrong inducer of IFN-1 response and suggest that cryptolepine-based medications such as C. sanguinolenta extract could be potentially tested in resource-limited regions of the world for the management of chronic viral infections as well ascancers.

From clinics acrossSouth Korea, 342 subjects with AECOPD were enrolled, and their blood, sputum, andurine samples were collected at baseline. A serologic test, sputum culture andpolymerase chain reaction (PCR), and UAT were performed to identify bacterialpathogens. Bacterial prevalence and regional distributions were analyzed. Thepatients' characteristics and clinical response between UAT-positive andUAT-negative groups were compared, as were the Streptococcus pneumoniae detectionrates using conventional sputum culture and PCR versus UAT. Results: The mostcommonly isolated pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae (30.3%), followed byStreptococcus pneumoniae (24.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.0%), with nosignificant regional differences in bacterial distribution. Patients withpositive UAT for Streptococcus pneumoniae showed no clinical failure when treatedwith respiratory quinolone (0.0%), whereas 11.8% of patients with negative UATshowed clinical failure (P=0.037). UAT showed moderate agreement with sputumculture by kappa coefficient (kappa=0.476). Conclusions: The bacterial prevalencein patients with moderate AECOPD in South Korea showed correlations with theglobal prevalence, without significant regional differences. In outpatientsettings, UAT has the potential to be used as a supplemental tool with sputumculture as a guide for determining the suspicion of bacterial exacerbation.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads rapidly,causing outbreaks that grow exponentially within a short period beforeinterventions are sought and effectively implemented. Testing is part of thefirst line of defense against Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), playing a critical role in the early identification and isolation of cases to slowtransmission, provision of targeted care to those affected, and protection ofhealth system operations. Laboratory tests for COVID-19 based on nucleic acidamplification techniques were rapidly developed in the early days of thepandemic, but such tests typically require sophisticated laboratoryinfrastructure and skilled staff. In March 2020, Zimbabwe confirmed its firstcase of COVID-19; this was followed by an increase in infection rates as thepandemic spread across the country, thus increasing the demand for testing. Onenational laboratory was set to test all the country's COVID-19 suspect cases,building pressure on human and financial resources. Staff burnout and longerturnaround times of more than 48 h were experienced, and results were releasedlate for clinical relevance. Leveraging on existing PCR testing platforms,including GeneXpert machines, eased the pressure for a short period before facingthe stockout of SARs-CoV-2 cartridges for a long time, leading to work overloadat a few testing sites contributing to long turnaround times. On September 11,WHO released the interim guidance to use antigen rapid diagnostic test as adiagnostic tool. The Zimbabwe laboratory pillar quickly adopted it and made plansfor its implementation. The National Microbiology Reference Laboratory verifiedthe two emergency-listed kits, the Panbio Abbott and the Standard Q, Biosensor,and they met the WHO minimum performance of >/=97% specificity and >/=80%sensitivity. Decentralizing diagnostic testing leveraging existing humanresources became a game-changer in improving COVID-19 containment measures. Task shifting through training on Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) commenced,and testing was decentralized to all the ten provinces, from 1 central testinglaboratory to more than 1,000 testing centers. WhatsApp platforms made it easier for data to be reported from remote areas. Result turnaround times were improved to the same day, and accessibility to testing was enhanced.

PG  - 10626
LID - 10.3389/ti.2022.10626 [doi]
AB  - Alloimmune responses in kidney transplant (KT) patients previously hospitalizedwith COVID-19 are understudied. We analyzed a cohort of 112 kidney transplantrecipients who were hospitalized following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test resultduring the first 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a cumulativeincidence of 17% for the development of new donor-specific antibodies (DSA) orincreased levels of pre-existing DSA in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected KTpatients. This risk extended 8 months post-infection. These changes in DSA statuswere associated with late allograft dysfunction. Risk factors for new orincreased DSA responses in this KT patient cohort included the presence ofcirculating DSA pre-COVID-19 diagnosis and time post-transplantation. COVID-19vaccination prior to infection and remdesivir administration during infectionwere each associated with decreased likelihood of developing a new or increasedDSA response. These data show that new or enhanced DSA responses frequently occuramong KT patients requiring admission with COVID-19 and suggest thatsurveillance, vaccination, and antiviral therapies may be important tools toprevent alloimmunity in these individuals.

AB  - Identification of epitopes targeted following virus infection or vaccination can guide vaccine design and development of therapeutic interventions targetingfunctional sites, but can be laborious. Herein, we employed peptide microarraysto map linear peptide epitopes (LPEs) recognized following SARS-CoV-2 infectionand vaccination. LPEs detected by nonhuman primate (NHP) and patient IgMs afterSARS-CoV-2 infection extensively overlapped, localized to functionally important virus regions, and aligned with reported neutralizing antibody binding sites.Similar LPE overlap occurred after infection and vaccination, with LPE clustersspecific to each stimulus, where strong and conserved LPEs mapping to sites knownor likely to inhibit spike protein function. Vaccine-specific LPEs tended to map to sites known or likely to be affected by structural changes induced by theproline substitutions in the mRNA vaccine's S protein. Mapping LPEs to regions ofknown functional importance in this manner may accelerate vaccine evaluation and discovery of targets for site-specific therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Stress is a physiological consequence of the body to adversity. The gut-brainaxis and probiotics are gaining interest to provide better treatment for stressand other neurological disorders. Probiotic (Lactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14 and Bacillus clausii, 10(10) colony-forming unit/day/animal, per oral) effects wereinvestigated in acute (up to day 7) and subacute (days 8-14) restraint-stressedand normal mice through behavioral paradigms (elevated plus maze: EPM, light darkbox/dark light box: LDB, and open field test: OFT). Time spent in the open armsof the EPM, time spent in the light compartment of the LDB, and movable time and time spent in the center of the OFT were significantly (p </= 0.05, n = 5)increased in probiotic-treated restraint-stressed mice. Enzyme-linked immunoassaydetermined blood cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, whichwere reduced significantly (p < 0.05, n = 5) in probiotic-treatedrestraint-stressed mice. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained hippocampal slides alsoshowed less or no neurodegeneration in the probiotic-treated animals.High-performance liquid chromatography and quantitative polymerase chain reactionwere performed to determine the monoamine levels and mRNA expression of dopamine receptor subtypes (D1 and D2) and synaptophysin in the mice hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels were also significantly (p < 0.05, n = 5) increased in the HC and PFC ofprobiotic-treated animal brains. Fold expression of mRNA of D1 and D2 (except HC,LF-S, day 14) receptors and synaptophysin was also significantly (p < 0.05, n =5) increased in the same brain parts of probiotic-treated restraint-stressedmice. Comparing mice in the Lactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14 and Bacillus clausii groups to mice in the normal group, only a significant (p < 0.05, n = 5) decreasewas observed in the serum ACTH and cortisol levels on day 14 in Bacillusclausii-treated mice, where all other parameters also showed improvement. Incomparison, Bacillus clausii showed greater stress suppressant activity thanLactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14. However, both probiotic bacteria can be a betterand safer therapeutic alternative for ailments than currently available drugs.

TI  - Butyrate Treatment of DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis Affects the Hepatic DrugMetabolism in Mice.
PG  - 936013
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.936013 [doi]
AB  - The development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated withalterations in the gut microbiota. There is currently no universal treatment for this disease, thus emphasizing the importance of developing innovativetherapeutic approaches. Gut microbiome-derived metabolite butyrate with itswell-known anti-inflammatory effect in the gut is a promising candidate. Due toincreased intestinal permeability during IBD, butyrate may also reach the liverand influence liver physiology, including hepatic drug metabolism. To get aninsight into this reason, the aim of this study was set to clarify not only theprotective effects of the sodium butyrate (SB) administration on colonicinflammation but also the effects of SB on hepatic drug metabolism inexperimental colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in mice. It has beenshown here that the butyrate pre-treatment can alleviate gut inflammation andreduce the leakiness of colonic epithelium by restoration of the assembly oftight-junction protein Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in mice with DSS-inducedcolitis. In this article, butyrate along with inflammation has also been shown toaffect the expression and enzyme activity of selected cytochromes P450 (CYPs) in the liver of mice. In this respect, CYP3A enzymes may be very sensitive to gutmicrobiome-targeted interventions, as significant changes in CYP3A expression andactivity in response to DSS-induced colitis and/or butyrate treatment have alsobeen observed. With regard to medications used in IBD and microbiota-targetedtherapeutic approaches, it is important to deepen our knowledge of the effect of gut inflammation, and therapeutic interventions were followed concerning theability of the organism to metabolize drugs. This gut-liver axis, mediatedthrough inflammation as well as microbiome-derived metabolites, may affect theresponse to IBD therapy.

AB  - Background: Improved mucosal immune profiling in active and quiescent colonicinflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is needed to develop therapeutic options fortreating and preventing flares. This study therefore aimed to provide acomprehensive mucosal characterization with emphasis on immunological hostresponse of patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC active), UC duringremission (UC remission) and active colonic Crohn's disease (CD active). Methods:Colonic biopsies from 47 study subjects were collected for gene expression andpathway analyses using the NanoString host-response panel, including 776 genesand 56 immune-related pathways. Results: The majority of mucosal gene expression and signaling pathway scores were increased in active IBD (n=27) compared tohealthy subjects (n=10). However, both active IBD and UC remission (n=10)demonstrated decreased gene expression and signaling pathway scores related toautophagy, alpha kinase-1 and IL-17 signaling pathways compared to healthysubjects. Further, UC remission was characterized by decreased scores of several signaling pathways linked to homeostasis along with increased mononuclear cellmigration pathway score as compared to healthy subjects. No major differences in the colonic mucosal gene expression between CD active (n=7) and UC (n=20) active were observed. Conclusion: This study indicates that autophagy, alpha kinase-1and IL-17 signaling pathways are persistently downregulated in UC irrespective ofdisease activity. Further, UC patients in remission present a unique mucosalenvironment, potentially preventing patients from reaching and sustaining truehomeostasis. These findings may enable better comprehension of the remitting and relapsing pattern of colonic IBD and guide future treatment and prevention offlares.

AB  - Obesity promotes the onset and progression of metabolic and inflammatory diseasessuch as type 2 diabetes. The chronic low-grade inflammation that occurs duringobesity triggers multiple signaling mechanisms that negatively affect organismal health. One such mechanism is the persistent activation and mitochondrialtranslocation of STAT3, which is implicated in inflammatory pathologies and many types of cancers. STAT3 in the mitochondria (mitoSTAT3) alters electron transportchain activity, thereby influencing nutrient metabolism and immune response.PBMCs and CD4(+) T cells from obese but normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) middle-agedsubjects had higher phosphorylation of STAT3 on residue serine 727 and moremitochondrial accumulation of STAT3 than cells from lean subjects. To evaluate ifcirculating lipid overabundance in obesity is responsible for age- andsex-matched mitoSTAT3, cells from lean subjects were challenged withphysiologically relevant doses of the saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitate and oleate, respectively. Fatty acid treatment caused robustaccumulation of mitoSTAT3 in all cell types, which was independent ofpalmitate-induced impairments in autophagy. Co-treatment of cells with fatty acidand trehalose prevented STAT3 phosphorylation and mitochondrial accumulation inan autophagy-independent but cellular peroxide-dependent mechanism.Pharmacological blockade of mitoSTAT3 either by a mitochondria-targeted STAT3inhibitor or ROS scavenging prevented obesity and fatty acid-induced productionof proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-6, thus establishing a mechanisticlink between mitoSTAT3 and inflammatory cytokine production.

AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (SDSD) is an important agent ofbovine mastitis. This infection causes an inflammatory reaction in udder tissue, being the most important disease-causing significant impact on the dairyindustry. Therefore, it leads to an increase in dairy farming to meet commercial demands. As a result, there is a major impact on both the dairy industry and the environment including global warming. Recurrent mastitis is often attributed tothe development of bacterial biofilms, which promote survival of sessile cells inhostile environments, and resistance to the immune system defense andantimicrobial therapy. Recently, we described the in vitro biofilm development onabiotic surfaces by bovine SDSD. In that work we integrated microbiology,imaging, and computational methods to evaluate the biofilm production capability of SDSD isolates on abiotic surfaces. Additionally, we reported that bovine SDSD can adhere and internalize human cells, including human epidermal keratinocyte(HEK) cells. We showed that the adherence and internalization rates of bovineSDSD isolates in HEK cells are higher than those of a SDSD DB49998-05 isolatedfrom humans. In vivo, bovine SDSD can cause invasive infections leading tozebrafish morbidity and mortality. In the present work, we investigated for thefirst time the capability of bovine SDSD to develop biofilm in vivo using amurine animal model and ex-vivo on human HEK cells. Bovine SDSD isolates wereselected based on their ability to form weak, moderate, or strong biofilms onglass surfaces. Our results showed that SDSD isolates displayed an increasedability to form biofilms on the surface of catheters implanted in mice whencompared to in vitro biofilm formation on abiotic surface. A greater ability toform biofilm in vitro after animal passage was observed for the VSD45 isolate,but not for the other isolates tested. Besides that, in vitro scanning electronmicroscopy demonstrated that SDSD biofilm development was visible after 4 hoursof SDSD adhesion to HEK cells. Cell viability tests showed an important reductionin the number of HEK cells after the formation of SDSD biofilms. In this study,the expression of genes encoding BrpA-like (biofilm regulatory protein), FbpA(fibronectin-binding protein A), HtrA (serine protease), and SagA (streptolysin Sprecursor) was higher for biofilm grown in vivo than in vitro, suggesting apotential role for these virulence determinants in the biofilm-development, host colonization, and SDSD infections. Taken together, these results demonstrate thatSDSD can develop biofilms in vivo and on the surface of HEK cells causingimportant cellular damages. As SDSD infections are considered zoonotic diseases, our data contribute to a better understanding of the role of biofilm accumulationduring SDSD colonization and pathogenesis not only in bovine mastitis, but theyalso shed some lights on the mechanisms of prosthesis-associated infection andcellulitis caused by SDSD in humans, as well.

AB  - Both, antibiotic persistence and antibiotic resistance characterize phenotypes ofsurvival in which a bacterial cell becomes insensitive to one (or even) moreantibiotic(s). However, the molecular basis for these two antibiotic-tolerantphenotypes is fundamentally different. Whereas antibiotic resistance isgenetically determined and hence represents a rather stable phenotype, antibioticpersistence marks a transient physiological state triggered by variousstress-inducing conditions that switches back to the original antibioticsensitive state once the environmental situation improves. The molecular basicsof antibiotic resistance are in principle well understood. This is not the casefor antibiotic persistence. Under all culture conditions, there is astochastically formed, subpopulation of persister cells in bacterial populations,the size of which depends on the culture conditions. The proportion of persistersin a bacterial population increases under different stress conditions, including treatment with bactericidal antibiotics (BCAs). Various models have been proposedto explain the formation of persistence in bacteria. We recently hypothesizedthat all physiological culture conditions leading to persistence converge in the inability of the bacteria to re-initiate a new round of DNA replication caused byan insufficient level of the initiator complex ATP-DnaA and hence by the lack of formation of a functional orisome. Here, we extend this hypothesis by proposingthat in this persistence state the bacteria become more susceptible tomutation-based antibiotic resistance provided they are equipped with error-prone DNA repair functions. This is - in our opinion - in particular the case when suchbacterial populations are exposed to BCAs.

PG  - 951009
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.951009 [doi]
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a serious threat to human life and property. TheIAV matrix protein 2 (M2) is significant in viral budding. Increasing studieshave proven the important roles of host factors in IAV replication. In thisstudy, immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry revealed that the hostprotein tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation proteingamma (YWHAG), which belongs to the 14-3-3 protein scaffold family, interactswith M2. Their interactions were further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation(Co-IP), immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy of virus-infected HeLacells. Moreover, we constructed YWHAG-KO and YWHAG-overexpressing cells and foundthat YWHAG knockout significantly increased viral production, whereas itsoverexpression reduced the titer of virus progeny. Therefore, YWHAG is a negativeregulatory factor during IAV infection. Further, YWHAG knockout or overexpressionhad no effect on the binding, entry, or viral RNA replication in the early stagesof the virus life cycle. On the contrary, it impaired the release of virions atthe plasma membrane as determined using transmission electron microscopy andsuppressed the M2-mediated budding of the influenza virus. Importantly, the H158Fmutation of YWHAG was found to affect interaction with M2 and its budding.Collectively, our work demonstrates that YWHAG is a novel cellular regulator thattargets and mediates the interaction and release of M2.

AB  - Peganum harmala L. is a perennial herb of the Tribulus family and its aerialparts and seeds can be used as medicine in the traditional medicine of China.However, the differences in chemical components and antibacterial activitybetween different parts have not been reported. In this study, the chemicalcomposition of the different parts of P. harmala was characterized byhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and headspace-solid phasemicroextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). Theantimicrobial activities of the different parts and some isolated components werealso carried out on 12 bacterial strains and phytopathogenic fungi. The HPLCresults revealed that the contents of harmine and harmaline in the seeds werehigher than that in the aerial parts. A total of 94 volatile organic compounds(VOCs) were tentatively identified by HS-SPME-GC-MS for the first time. The majorcomponents were methyl hexadecanoate, p-xylene, octane, (Z)-9-octadecanoate,ethylbenzene, methyl octadecanoate, ethyl hexadecanoate, and methyltetradecanoate. At the concentration of 800 mug.mL(-1), the methanol extracts of seeds showed stronger antimicrobial activities with a wide antimicrobialspectrum, inhibiting Escherichia coli (ATCC 24433), Xanthomonas oryzae (ACCC11602), and Xanthomonas axonopodis with inhibitory rates of more than 90%.Furthermore, harmine and harmaline showed better antibacterial activities againstall the bacteria. These findings indicated that alkaloids from P. harmala couldaccount for antimicrobial activity, which could be used as lead molecules in the development of new antimicrobial drugs.

AB  - This study aims to obtain anaerobic fungi from the rumen and fecal samples andinvestigates their potential for lignocellulosic bioconversion. Multipleanaerobic strains were isolated from rumen contents (CR1-CR21) and fecal samples (CF1-CF10) of Bactrian camel using the Hungate roll tube technique. Afterscreening for fiber degradability, strains from rumen contents (Oontomyces sp.CR2) and feces (Piromyces sp. CF9) were compared with Pecoramyces sp. F1 (earlierisolated from goat rumen, having high CAZymes of GHs) for various fermentationand digestion parameters. The cultures were fermented with different substrates(reed, alfalfa stalk, Broussonetia papyrifera leaves, and Melilotus officinalis) at 39 degrees C for 96 h. The Oontomyces sp. CR2 had the highest total gas andhydrogen production from most substrates in the in vitro rumen fermentationsystem and also had the highest digestion of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber,acid detergent fiber, and cellulose present in most substrates used. The isolatedstrains provided higher amounts of metabolites such as lactate, formate, acetate,and ethanol in the in vitro rumen fermentation system for use in variousindustrial applications. The results illustrated that anaerobic fungi isolatedfrom Bactrian camel rumen contents (Oontomyces sp. CR2) have the highestlignocellulosic bioconversion potential, suggesting that the Bactrian camel rumencould be a good source for the isolation of anaerobic fungi for industrialapplications.

AB  - Nitrification inhibitor (NI) is often claimed to be efficient in mitigatingnitrogen (N) losses from agricultural production systems by slowing downnitrification. Increasing evidence suggests that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) have the genetic potential to producenitrous oxide (N2O) and perform the first step of nitrification, but theircontribution to N2O and nitrification remains unclear. Furthermore, both AOA and AOB are probably targets for NIs, but a quantitative synthesis is lacking toidentify the "indicator microbe" as the best predictor of NI efficiency underdifferent environmental conditions. In this present study, a meta-analysis toassess the response characteristics of AOB and AOA to NI application wasconducted and the relationship between NI efficiency and the AOA and AOB amoAgenes response under different conditions was evaluated. The dataset consisted of48 papers (214 observations). This study showed that NIs on average reduced 58.1%of N2O emissions and increased 71.4% of soil NH 4 + concentrations, respectively.When 3, 4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) was applied with both organic andinorganic fertilizers in alkaline medium soils, it had higher efficacy ofdecreasing N2O emissions than in acidic soils. The abundance of AOB amoA geneswas dramatically reduced by about 50% with NI application in most soil types.Decrease in N2O emissions with NI addition was significantly correlated with AOB changes (R (2) = 0.135, n = 110, P < 0.01) rather than changes in AOA, and there was an obvious correlation between the changes in NH 4 + concentration and AOBamoA gene abundance after NI application (R (2) = 0.037, n = 136, P = 0.014). Theresults indicated the principal role of AOB in nitrification, furthermore, AOBwould be the best predictor of NI efficiency.

AB  - Monitoring the growth of bacterial cultures is one of the most common techniques in microbiology. This is usually achieved by using expensive and bulkyspectrophotometric plate readers which periodically measure the optical densityof bacterial cultures during the incubation period. In this study, we present acompletely novel way of obtaining bacterial growth curves based on theclassification of scanned images of cultures rather than using spectrophotometricmeasurements. We trained a deep learning model with images of bacterial brothscontained in microplates, and we integrated it into a custom-made softwareapplication that triggers a flatbed scanner to timely capture images,automatically processes the images, and represents all growth curves. Thedeveloped tool, ScanGrow, is presented as a low-cost and high-throughputalternative to plate readers, and it only requires a computer connected to aflatbed scanner and equipped with our open-source ScanGrow application. Inaddition, this application also assists in the pre-processing of data to createand evaluate new models, having the potential to facilitate many routinemicrobiological techniques.

AB  - This study investigates the isolation, identification, and fermentationperformance of autochthonous acetic acid bacteria (AAB) from local niche habitatson the Island of Gozo (Malta) and their further use for vinegar production,employing local raw materials. The bacteria were isolated from grapevine berries and vinegar produced in the cottage industry. Following phenotype and genotypeidentification, the AAB were ascribed to the genera Acetobacter, Gluconobacter,and Komagataeibacter. A mixture of selected AAB was tested as an inoculum forvinegar production in bench fermenters, under different conditions andsubstrates, namely, grapes, honey, figs, onions, prickly pear, and tomatoes. The bench fermenters were operated under semi-continuous fermentation where workingvolumes were maintained by discharging and subsequent recharging accordingly tomaintain the acidity in fermenters by adding 30-50 g/l of acetic acid for optimalAcetobacteraceae performance. Finally, the vinegar products obtained from thedifferent substrates were evaluated for their quality, including organolepticproperties, which showed the superior quality of wood-treated vinegar sampleswith respect to neat vinegar samples.

AB  - To achieve energy-efficient shortcut nitrogen removal of wastewater in thefuture, selective elimination of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) while enrichingammonia-oxidizing microorganisms is a crucial step. However, the underlyingmechanisms of partial nitrification are still not well understood, especially thenewly discovered ultrasound-based partial nitrification. To elucidate this issue,in this study two bioreactors were set up, with one established partialnitrification by ultrasonication while the other didn't. During the operation of both reactors, the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbialcommunity were investigated through metagenomics analysis. The result showed thatduring ultrasonic partial nitrification, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA),Nitrososphaerales, was enriched more than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB),Nitrosomonas. The enrichment of microorganisms in the community increased theabundance of genes involved in microbial energy generation from lipid andcarbohydrates. On the other hand, the abundance of NOB, Nitrospira andNitrolancea, and Comammox Nitrospira decreased. Selective inhibition of NOB washighly correlated with genes involved in signal transduction enzymes, such asencoding histidine kinase and serine/threonine kinase. These findings provideddeep insight into partial nitrification and contributed to the development ofshortcut nitrification in wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - Beneficial bacteria promise to promote the health and productivity of farmed fishspecies. However, the impact on host physiology is largely strain-dependent, and studies on Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a commercially farmed salmonidspecies, are lacking. In this study, 10 candidate probiotic strains weresubjected to in vitro assays, small-scale growth trials, and behavioral analysis with juvenile Arctic char to examine the impact of probiotic supplementation onfish growth, behavior and the gut microbiome. Most strains showed high tolerance to gastric juice and fish bile acid, as well as high auto-aggregation activity,which are important probiotic characteristics. However, they neither markedlyaltered the core gut microbiome, which was dominated by three bacterial species, nor detectably colonized the gut environment after the 4-week probiotictreatment. Despite a lack of long-term colonization, the presence of thebacterial strains showed either beneficial or detrimental effects on the hostthrough growth rate enhancement or reduction, as well as changes in fish motilityunder confinement. This study offers insights into the effect of bacterialstrains on a salmonid host and highlights three strains, Carnobacterium divergensV41, Pediococcus acidilactici ASG16, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarumISCAR-07436, for future research into growth promotion of salmonid fish throughprobiotic supplementation.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play vital roles in regulating biogeochemical processes. The composition and function of soil microbial community have been well studied, but little is known about the responses of bacterial and fungal communities todifferent habitats of the same plant, especially the inter-kingdom co-occurrence pattern including bacteria and fungi. Herein, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the bacterial and fungal communities of five Phragmites australis habitats in the Yellow River Delta and constructed their inter-kingdominteraction network by network analysis. The results showed that richness did notdiffer significantly among habitats for either the bacterial or fungalcommunities. The distribution of soil bacterial community was significantlyaffected by soil physicochemical properties, whereas that of the fungal communitywas not. The main functions of the bacterial and fungal communities were toparticipate in the degradation of organic matter and element cycling, both ofwhich were significantly affected by soil physicochemical properties. Networkanalysis revealed that bacteria and fungi participated in the formation ofnetworks through positive interactions; the role of intra-kingdom interactionswere more important than inter-kingdom interactions. In addition, rare speciesacted as keystones played a critical role in maintaining the network structure,while NO 3 - - N likely played an important role in maintaining the networktopological properties. Our findings provided insights into the inter-kingdommicrobial co-occurrence network and response of the soil microbial communitycomposition and function to different P. australis habitats in coastal wetlands, which will deepen our insights into microbial community assembly in coastalwetlands.

AB  - Bacillus cereus is a major food-borne bacterial pathogen in the world, which can cause diarrhea and emetic syndrome. This study aimed to reveal the quantitativeprevalence of B. cereus in ready-to-eat (RTE) rice products in Eastern China and to gain essential information on the characteristics of B. cereus isolates. Atotal of 91 out of the 1071 samples were positive for B. cereus. Thecontamination level of B. cereus in 0.5 % of RTE rice product samples outnumbered10(3) CFU/g. The number of B. cereus attained 10(5)-10(6) CFU/g in one sample.The distribution patterns of virulence genes in B. cereus isolates wereidentified. 84.6% of the B. cereus isolates had at least one enterotoxin oremetic toxin gene. The predominant pattern was XXV. 9.9% of isolates belonged to it and possessed one enterotoxin gene entFM. The occurrence rate of hblACD andnheABC was 36.3% and 47.3%, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility testsrevealed a high resistance rate toward penicillin, and 23.1% of the isolates weremulti-drug resistant. B. cereus isolates were genotyped by using ERIC-PCR. 89genotypes were determined. The Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI) attained0.9995. Relationships analysis revealed that Group A B. cereus isolates tended tocarry hblA, hblC, hblD, nheA, nheB, and show resistance topenicillin/trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This study was useful for updating the knowledge of the contamination status of B. cereus in RTE rice products in China.

AB  - Endophytic bacteria are known to impact the growth and fitness of agriculturally relevant plants. However, there are limited reports describing endophyticbacteria related to mulberry (Morus L.). The present study used Illumina-based16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the endophytic bacterial communities oftwo mulberry cultivars with differing resistance to low temperature, under coldconditions. In most cases, the bacterial communities of endophytes in the rootexhibited higher richness compared with those in the stem, and the communities inresistant cultivar X792 exhibited higher richness compared with those of thesensitive cultivar "Da Shi" (DS). The difference in the proportion of uniqueoperational taxonomic units showed the same trend. The number of genera withsignificant differences in abundance was greater between organs than betweenmonths, and greater between months than between cultivars. Microbial diversityanalysis showed that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla inall samples, while Pseudomonas, Steroidobacter, and Rhodococcus were the dominantgenera in different samples. There were significant differences between cultivarsDS and X792 in the relative abundance of Pseudomonas, Acidibacter,Frigoribacterium, Gaiella, and Pseudokineococcus. PICRUSt predictions indicatedthat the relative abundances of endophytic bacteria in membrane transport andsignal transduction were significantly higher in the stem of resistant cultivarX792 in January compared with that of sensitive cultivar DS. Analysis ofbeta-Diversity also revealed distinct differences in endophytic bacterialcommunities of stem and root, and communities of the stem in January andFebruary. The complex correlation of the endophytic communities was higher insensitive mulberry cultivar DS compared with resistant cultivar X792, in the stemcompared with the root, and in January compared with February. Overall, findings from this study suggested that the diversity and community structure ofendophytic bacteria in mulberry were significantly influenced by organs andmonths, followed by the host cultivar. The study provides insight into thecomplex microbial diversity of mulberry under cold conditions.

TI  - Miscarriage Risk Factors for Pregnant Women: A Cohort Study in Eastern Algeria's Population.
PG  - 109-120
LID - 10.1007/s13224-021-01564-0 [doi]
AB  - Background: Miscarriage is defined as an adverse and unexpected termination ofpregnancy; it is the most frequent pregnancy complication. Here, we aimed toidentify the factors predisposing to miscarriage in pregnant women in EasternAlgeria and the effect of the combination of several factors, including maternal Body Mass Index (BMI), maternal age, concomitant pathologies, and nutrients, and to predict the occurrence of miscarriage. Methods: A total of 786 pregnant women from Eastern Algeria were interviewed between 2011 and 2015. Association between miscarriage exposure and identified risk factors was assessed using a GeneralizedLinear Model (GLM), ANOVA test, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), andHierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA). Throughout this study, we sought to find answers, discuss this association, and predict the occurrence of miscarriage.Results: We developed a predictive model for miscarriage, and we found thatmiscarriage was significantly higher for pregnant women aged over 35 years (1.75;95% CI: 0.75-4.37; p = 0.208), with a high BMI (> 25 kg/m(2)), (1.88; 95%CI:1.28-2.78; p = 0.001). We have highlighted that miscarriage is stronglyassociated with hypertension (1.67; 95% CI: 1.16-2.39; p = 0.006), diet rich inmeat (0.60; 95% CI: 0.33-1.04; p = 0.075), and moderate in fish (2.32; 95% CI:1.18-4.58; p = 0.015). Conclusion: Our study proved that knowing these riskfactors helps to establish predictive models and strategies to prevent tragicpregnancy outcomes and highlights the link between miscarriage and several riskfactors; and thus, will allow protecting mother and fetus health.

TI  - Cytokine Profile in Children with Severe Multisystem Inflammatory SyndromeRelated to the Coronavirus Disease 2019.
PG  - 259-264
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1724101 [doi]
AB  - The multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel andconcerning entity related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although MIS-C has been the subject of intensive researchefforts, its pathophysiology and optimal treatment remain elusive. We studied theclinical features, laboratory findings, and immunoinflammatory profiles of seven children prospectively admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) during the first wave of the pandemic. All patients had immunoglobulin (Ig)-G againstSARS-CoV-2, four of seven patients had both IgM and IgG, and in one of the 7SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a respiratory sample. All patients receivedintravenous fluid boluses (median: 15 mL/kg) and norepinephrine. The most common form of respiratory support was supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. None ofthe patients needed mechanical ventilation. The cardiovascular system wasfrequently involved. All patients had an elevated troponin-I (median: 107.3ng/L). Four out of seven patients had coronary artery abnormalities, and two ofseven had both abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) findings and evidence of leftventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram. Ig levels and complement function werenormal. Peripheral blood phenotyping with flow cytometry showed decreased T-cell numbers at the expense of CD8+ T-cells. Cytokine profiling showed a heterogeneousincrease in interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon(IFN)-gamma, IL-18, IL-2Ra, IL-10, and IL-1Ra that tended to normalize aftertreatment. Our study shows that children with MIS-C have elevated plasma levelsof pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the acute phase of the disease withoutother relevant immunologic disturbances. These findings suggest the presence of amixed antagonist response syndrome (MARS) similar to that present in pediatricsepsis. Combining a meticulous differential diagnosis with cautiously coordinatedimmunomodulatory therapy and high-quality supportive care can help cliniciansavoid causing iatrogenic harm in patients with MIS-C.

TI  - PfSPZ-CVac malaria vaccine demonstrates safety among malaria-experienced adults: A randomized, controlled phase 1 trial.
PG  - 101579
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101579 [doi]
AB  - Background: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) Sporozoite (SPZ) Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine (PfSPZ-CVac) involves concurrently administering infectious PfSPZ and malariadrug, often chloroquine (CQ), to kill liver-emerging parasites. PfSPZ-CVac (CQ)protected 100% of malaria-naive participants against controlled human malariainfection. We investigated the hypothesis that PfSPZ-CVac (CQ) is safe andefficacious against seasonal, endemic Pf in malaria-exposed adults. Methods:Healthy 18-45 year olds were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trialin Bougoula-Hameau, Mali, randomized 1:1 to 2.048 x 10(5) PfSPZ (PfSPZ Challenge)or normal saline administered by direct venous inoculation at 0, 4, 8 weeks.Syringes were prepared by pharmacy staff using online computer-based enrolmentthat randomized allocations. Clinical team and participant masking was assured byidentical appearance of vaccine and placebo. Participants received chloroquine600mg before first vaccination, 10 weekly 300mg doses during vaccination, thenseven daily doses of artesunate 200mg before 24-week surveillance during therainy season. Safety outcomes were solicited adverse events (AEs) and relatedunsolicited AEs within 12 days of injections, and all serious AEs. Pf infectionwas detected by thick blood smears performed every four weeks and during febrile illness over 48 weeks. Primary vaccine efficacy (VE) endpoint was time toinfection at 24 weeks. NCT02996695. Findings: 62 participants were enrolled inApril/May 2017. Proportions of participants experiencing at least one solicitedsystemic AE were similar between treatment arms: 6/31 (19.4%, 95%CI 9.2-36.3) of PfSPZ-CVac recipients versus 7/31 (22.6%, 95%CI 29.2-62.2) of controls (p value =1.000). Two/31 (6%) in each group reported related, unsolicited AEs. Oneunrelated death occurred. Of 59 receiving 3 immunizations per protocol, fewervaccinees (16/29, 55.2%) became infected than controls (22/30, 73.3%). VE was33.6% by hazard ratio (p = 0.21, 95%CI -27.9, 65.5) and 24.8% by risk ratio (p = 0.10, 95%CI -4.8, 54.3). Antibody responses to PfCSP were poor; 28% of vaccinees sero-converted. Interpretation: PfSPZ-CVac (CQ) was well-tolerated. The testeddosing regimen failed to significantly protect against Pf infection in this very high transmission setting.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus patients are prone to cutaneous and subcutaneous fungalinfections due to pathogenic fungi, including dermatophytes, Mucorales, Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium species. Here, we report a case of A. flavus mycetomaconfirmed by isolation and molecular identification. The case was a 38-year-oldmale farmer with a seven-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, living inKhuzestan, southwest of Iran. The patient presented with a right foot swellingassociated with a nodule and multiple discharging sinuses following traumasustained on the foot while working barefoot on the rice farm, a year ago. Thenodule appeared at the site of the trauma two months after the injury. Theinitial diagnosis was based on direct microscopic examination of lesions scrapingusing 20% potassium hydroxide and radiology. Molecular analysis confirmed theisolates to be A. flavus. In vitro susceptibility of the isolate to voriconazole,posaconazole, caspofungin, itraconazole, and amphotericin B was determined.Treatment with voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) stopped the purulent discharge, reduced the swelling, and improved the clinical condition within two months. The study emphasizes the importance of wearing footwear to prevent skin trauma as themain risk factor of patient involvement.

LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2022.07.027 [doi]
AB  - BamA, the core component of the beta-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, is an integral outer membrane protein (OMP) in Gram-negative bacteria that catalyzesthe folding and insertion of OMPs. A key feature of BamA relevant to its functionis a lateral gate between its first and last beta-strands. Opening of thislateral gate is one of the first steps in the asymmetric-hybrid-barrel model ofBamA function. In this study, multiple hybrid-barrel folding intermediates ofBamA and a substrate OMP, EspP, were constructed and simulated to betterunderstand the model's physical consequences. The hybrid-barrel intermediatesconsisted of the BamA beta-barrel and its POTRA5 domain and either one, two,three, four, five, or six beta-hairpins of EspP. The simulation results supportan asymmetric-hybrid-barrel model in which the BamA N-terminal beta-strand forms stronger interactions with the substrate OMP than the C-terminal beta-strand. Aconsistent "B"-shaped conformation of the final folding intermediate wasobserved, and the shape of the substrate beta-barrel within the hybrid matchedthe shape of the fully folded substrate. Upon further investigation,inward-facing glycines were found at sharp bends within the hybrid and fullyfolded beta-barrels. Together, the data suggest an influence of sequence on shapeof the substrate barrel throughout the OMP folding process and of the fullyfolded OMP.

TI  - Isolation and Identification of Bioactive Compounds with Antimicrobial Activityfrom Marine Facultative Anaerobe, Bacillus Subtilis.
LID - 10.2174/1389201023666220801090810 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The marine ecosystem contains many microbial species that produceunique, biologically active secondary metabolites with complex chemicalstructures. We aimed to isolate and identify bioactive compounds withantimicrobial properties produced by a facultative anaerobic strain of Bacillussubtilis (AU-RM-1), isolated from marine sediment. METHODOLOGY: We optimized the AU-RM-1 growth conditions, analyzed its growth kinetics, and its phenotypic andgenotypic characteristics. Extracts of the isolate were studied for antimicrobialactivity against three clinically important microorganisms and the structure ofthe active compound was identified by spectroscopy. RESULTS: Antimicrobialactivity of the AU-RM-1 DMSO extract was evaluated by disc diffusion assay and byserial dilution. The AU-RM-1 DMSO extract showed antimicrobial activity againstCandida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The bioactivefraction of the AU-RM-1 DMSO extract was separated by TLC-bioautography at Rf =0.49. We then used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) to study the morphological changes in the bacterial cellstreated with the isolated compound. It was observed that cells seemed to shrink, and the cell walls appeared to be damaged. A bioactive compound was identified,and its structure was examined by spectroscopic analysis: a LC-MS molecular ionpeak (ESI) m/z (% of relative abundance) was calculated for C19H22O3: 298.38, andfound to be C19H22O3+1: 299.51 [M+1]. The chemical structure of the compound(2-(2-{8-methoxy-5aH,6H,7H,8H,9H,9aH-naphtho[2,1-b]furan-7-yl}ethyl)furan) wasdetermined using 1HNMR and 13CNMR, and its purity was confirmed by HPLC. Fifteen known and previously reported compounds were also identified, in addition to the novel compound; these were lipopeptides, antibiotics and chemical moieties.CONCLUSION: The facultative anaerobic marine organism Bacillus subtilis (AU-RM-1)produces a novel bioactive secondary metabolite with antimicrobial and antifungalactivity.

AB  - Even though the promising therapies against cancer are rapidly improved, theoncology patients population has seen exponential growth, placing cancer in 5thplace among the ten deadliest diseases. Efficient drug delivery systems mustovercome multiple barriers and maximize drug delivery to the target tumors,limiting the side effects simultaneously. Since the first observation of thequantum tunneling phenomenon, many multidisciplinary studies have offeredquantum-inspired solutions to optimized tumor mapping and efficient nanodrugdesign. The property of a wave function to propagate through a potential barrier offer the capability of obtaining 3D surface profiles using imaging of individualatoms on the surface of a material. The application of quantum tunneling on ascanning tunneling microscope offers an exact surface roughness mapping of tumorsand pharmaceutical particles. Critical elements to cancer nanotherapeutics apply the fractal theory and calculate the fractal dimension for efficient tumorsurface imaging at the atomic level. This review study presents the latestbiological approaches to cancer management based on fractal geometry.

LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220801143650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 2,5-Diketopiperazines (DKPs), also called cyclic dipeptides, are the simplest peptide derivatives in nature that are formed by condensation of twoamino acids. They are an important category of bioactive substances with various structures. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the natural sources, syntheticprocesses, biological properties and MS fragmentation regularity of simple DKPs, in order to provide a reference for exploring future scientific and therapeuticpotentials of these compounds. METHOD: Pertinent information was collected andorganized from several electronic scientific databases (e.g., Web of Science,China Knowledge Resource Integrated, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Wanfang Data andGoogle Scholar), PhD and MS dissertations. There are 105 articles published from the early 20th century to 2021 were reviewed in this work. RESULTS: DKPs havebeen obtained from a broad range of natural resources, including fungi, bacteria,plants, and animals, and been synthesized by chemical and biological methods.DKPs have various pharmacological activities, including anticancer,antibacterial, antithrombotic, neuron protective, analgesic, and otheractivities. Mass spectrometry is the most common method for the structuralanalysis of DKPs. DKPs can be quickly screened and identified by MS according to the mass spectrum fragmentation pattern of them. CONCLUSION: As a category ofrelatively unexplored compounds, DKPs have been demonstrated to have variousbioactivities, especially with antitumor and antibacterial activities. However,the existing research of DKPs is still in the early stage, and their application in drug development needs to be further studied.

TI  - Antioxidant, Antibacterial, Antidiabetic Potential, and In silico Analysis ofRhus chinensis from Western Nepal.
LID - 10.2174/1568026622666220803153226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhus chinensis Mill, indigenous wild fruit primarily found in thehilly region of Nepal. The ripe fruit is very sour and considered medicinal as a remedy for colic pain. In addition, their astringent and styptic qualities areused internally to treat illnesses such as diarrhea and hemorrhage. Also, theyare used as a common component of polyherbal medications for diabetic mellitus.OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to determine the total phenolic and flavonoidcontent, antioxidant, antibacterial, alpha-glucosidase, and alpha-amylaseinhibition activity of the crude extract and fractions of Rhus chinensis Mill.Additionally, molecular docking of compounds from Rhus chinensis was performed.METHODS: Folin Ciocalteu's (FC) reagent was used for the estimation of totalphenolic content. Likewise, the aluminium trichloride method was applied for the determination of total flavonoid content. For the antioxidant activity, a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay was performed.Furthermore, the substrate-based enzyme inhibition assay was carried out foralpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibition activity of R. chinensis.P-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG) and2-Chloro-4-Nitrophenyl-alpha-D-Maltotrioside (CNPG3) were used as substrates for alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibition assay, respectively. Similarly,the well-diffusion method was used for the antibacterial activity. Autodock vina was used to perform the molecular docking. RESULTS: The total phenolic andflavonoid content of R. chinensis fruit were found 117.092+/-1.1 mg GAE/g and62.41+/-1.23 mg QE/g, respectively. The IC50 value for antioxidant activity ofthe crude extract and its fractions ranged from 3.12+/-1.15mug/mL to50.85+/-2.10mug/mL. Similarly, the IC50 for alpha-glucosidase inhibition rangedfrom2.33+/-1.01microg/mL to 28.34+/-2.79mug/mL. Likewise, The IC50 of R.chinensis crude methanolic extract against alpha-amylase was120.3+/-1.382microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of R. chinensis was effective against gram-positive bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus (ZOI=11.0) and Bacillussubtilis (ZOI=9.0). Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside and Myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside showed excellent binding to the active site of protein with binding energy -9.4kcal/mol and -9.6kcal/mol, respectively. CONCLUSION: Rhus chinensis Mill is a potentantioxidant and inhibits enzymes; alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. Inaddition, the methanolic extract of this plant shows antibacterial activity.However, further research is required to determine the inhibiting compounds.

TI  - Local assessment of the immunohistochemical expression of Foxp3(+) regulatory Tlymphocytes in the different pathological forms associated with bovineparatuberculosis.
PG  - 299
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03399-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infected animals show avariety of granulomatous lesions, from focal forms with well-demarcatedgranulomas restricted to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), that are seenin the initial phases or latency stages, to a diffuse granulomatous enteritis,with abundant (multibacillary) or scant (paucibacillary) bacteria, seen inclinical stages. Factors that determine the response to the infection,responsible for the occurrence of the different types of lesion, are still notfully determined. It has been seen that regulatory T cells (Treg) play animportant role in various diseases where they act on the limitation of theimmunopathology associated with the immune response. In the case ofparatuberculosis (PTB) the role of Treg lymphocytes in the immunity against Mapis far away to be completely understood; therefore, several studies addressingthis subject have appeared recently. The aim of this work was to assess, byimmunohistochemical methods, the presence of Foxp3(+) T lymphocytes in intestinalsamples with different types of lesions seen in cows with PTB. METHODS:Intestinal samples of twenty cows showing the different pathological forms of PTBwere evaluated: uninfected controls (n = 5), focal lesions (n = 5), diffusepaucibacillary (n = 5) and diffuse multibacillary (n = 5) forms. Foxp3(+)lymphocyte distribution was assessed by differential cell count in intestinallamina propria (LP), gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and mesenteric lymphnode (MLN). RESULTS: A significant increase in the number of Foxp3(+) T cells wasobserved in infected animals with respect to control group, regardless of thetype of lesion. However, when the different categories of lesion were analyzedindependently, all individuals with PTB lesions showed an increase in the amount of Foxp3(+) T lymphocytes compared to the control group but this increase wasonly significant in cows with focal lesions and, to a lesser extent, in animalswith diffuse paucibacillary forms. The former showed the highest numbers,significantly different from those found in cows with diffuse lesions, where nodifferences were noted between the two forms. No specific distribution patternwas observed within the granulomatous lesions in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of Foxp3(+) T cells in focal forms, that have been associated withlatency or resistance to infection, suggest an anti-inflammatory action of these cells at these stages, helping to prevent exacerbation of the inflammatoryresponse, as occurs in diffuse forms, responsible for the appearance of clinical signs.

LID - 10.1186/s12929-022-00837-8 [doi]
AB  - All cells in the changing tumor microenvironment (TME) need a class ofcheckpoints to regulate the balance among exocytosis, endocytosis, recycling and degradation. The vesicular trafficking and secretion pathways regulated by thesmall Rab GTPases and their effectors convey cell growth and migration signalsand function as meditators of intercellular communication and molecular transfer.Recent advances suggest that Rab proteins govern conventional and unconventional vesicular secretion pathways by trafficking widely diverse cargoes and substratesin remodeling TME. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of conventional andunconventional vesicular secretion pathways, their action modes and impacts onthe cancer and stromal cells have been the focus of much attention for the pasttwo decades. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of vesicularsecretion pathways in TME. We begin with an overview of the structure,regulation, substrate recognition and subcellular localization of vesicularsecretion pathways. We then systematically discuss how the three fundamentalvesicular secretion processes respond to extracellular cues in TME. Theseprocesses are the conventional protein secretion via the endoplasmicreticulum-Golgi apparatus route and two types of unconventional protein secretionvia extracellular vesicles and secretory autophagy. The latest advances andfuture directions in vesicular secretion-involved interplays between tumor cells,stromal cell and host immunity are also described.

TI  - Candida auris PCR for high throughput screening.
LID - myac057 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/mmy/myac057 [doi]
AB  - Candida auris has significant implications for infection control due to itsmultidrug resistance and spread in healthcare settings. Current culture-basedscreening methods are laborious and risks muco-cutaneous colonisation oflaboratory staff. We describe the adaptation of a published real-time PCR for theidentification of C. auris in skin swabs for high throughput infection controlscreening. Two published primer and probe sets were analysed utilising serial10-fold dilutions of fifteen C. auris strains to assess the PCR limit ofdetection. One primer and probe set was compatible with our laboratory workflowand was selected for further development yielding a limit of detection of 1colony forming unit (CFU) per reaction. Non-C. auris isolates, as well as routineskin swabs (n = 100) were tested by culture and PCR to assess specificity, where no cross-reactivity was detected. Skin swabs from a proven C. auris case (n = 6) were all both culture positive and PCR positive, while surveillance swabs fromclose contacts (n = 46) were all both culture negative and PCR negative. Finally,use of a lysis buffer comprising 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate renderedswab-equivalent quantities of C. auris non-viable, providing assurance of thesafety benefit of PCR over culture. The development of a PCR assay for highthroughput infection control screening is a promising method for rapid detection of C. auris with utility in an outbreak setting.

TI  - Quantitative microbial population study reveals geographical differences inbacterial symbionts of Ixodes ricinus.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/s40168-022-01276-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ixodes ricinus ticks vector pathogens that cause serious healthconcerns. Like in other arthropods, the microbiome may affect the tick's biology,with consequences for pathogen transmission. Here, we explored the bacterialcommunities of I. ricinus across its developmental stages and six geographiclocations by the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, combined with quantification ofthe bacterial load. RESULTS: A wide range of bacterial loads was found. Accurate quantification of low microbial biomass samples permitted comparisons to highbiomass samples, despite the presence of contaminating DNA. The bacterialcommunities of ticks were associated with geographical location rather than life stage, and differences in Rickettsia abundance determined this association.Subsequently, we explored the geographical distribution of four verticallytransmitted symbionts identified in the microbiome analysis. For that, wescreened 16,555 nymphs from 19 forest sites for R. helvetica, Rickettsiella spp.,Midichloria mitochondrii, and Spiroplasma ixodetis. Also, the infection rates anddistributions of these symbionts were compared to the horizontally transmittedpathogens Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, andNeoehrlichia mikurensis. The infection rates of all vertically transmittedsymbionts differed between the study sites, and none of the symbionts was presentin all tested ticks suggesting a facultative association with I. ricinus. Theproportions in which symbionts occurred in populations of I. ricinus were highly variable, but geographically close study sites expressed similar proportions.These patterns were in contrast to what we observed for horizontally transmitted pathogens. Lastly, nearly 12% of tested nymphs were free of any targetedmicroorganisms, which is in line with the microbiome analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Ourresults show that the microbiome of I. ricinus is highly variable, but changesgradually and ticks originating from geographically close forest sites expresssimilar bacterial communities. This suggests that geography-related factorsaffect the infection rates of vertically transmitted symbionts in I. ricinus.Since some symbionts, such as R. helvetica can cause disease in humans, wepropose that public health investigations consider geographical differences inits infection rates.

LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06594-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from recent clinical trials on bone marrow mononuclear cell(BM-MNC) transplantation show that this intervention can help reduce theincidence of heart failure (HF) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However,no study has evaluated the effect of the transplantation of mesenchymal stemcells (MSCs) on a clinical endpoint such as HF. METHODS: This single-blinded,randomized, multicenter trial aims to establish whether the intracoronaryinfusion of umbilical cord-derived Wharton's jelly MSCs (WJ-MSCs) helps preventHF development after AMI. The study will enroll 390 patients 3 to 7 daysfollowing AMI. Only patients aged below 65 years with impaired LV function (LVEF < 40%) will be included. They will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to either receivestandard care or a single intracoronary infusion of 10(7) WJ-MSCs. The primaryoutcome of this study is the assessment of HF development during long-termfollow-up (3 years). DISCUSSION: Data will be collected until Nov 2024.Thereafter, the analysis will be conducted. Results are expected to be ready byDec 2024. We will prepare and submit the related manuscript following the CONSORTguidelines. This study will help determine whether or not the infusion ofintracoronary WJ-MSCs in patients with AMI will reduce the incidence ofAMI-induced HF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05043610 , Registeredon 14 September 2021 - retrospectively registered.

TI  - Molecular determination of O25b/ST131 clone type among extended spectrumbeta-lactamases production Escherichia coli recovering from urinary tractinfection isolates.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s12941-022-00526-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli (E. coli) O25b/ST131 clone causes urinary tractinfection (UTI) and is associated with a broad spectrum of other infections, suchas intra-abdominal and soft tissue infections, that can be affecting bloodstream infections. Therefore, since O25b/ST131 has been reported in several studies fromIran, in the current study, we have investigated the molecular characteristics,typing, and biofilm formation of O25b/ST131 clone type E. coli collected from UTIspecimens. METHODS: A total of 173 E. coli isolates from UTI were collected. The susceptibility to all fourth generations of cephalosporins (cefazolin,cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime) and ampicillin,ampicillin-sulbactam and aztreonam was determined. Class A ESBLs, class D ESBLand the presence of pabB gene screenings to detect of O25b/ST131 clone type were performed by using of PCR. Biofilm formation was compared between O25b/ST131isolates and non-O25b/ST131 isolates. Finally, ERIC-PCR was used for typing ofESBL positive isolates. RESULTS: Ninety-four ESBL positive were detected of which79 of them were O25b/ST131. Antimicrobial susceptibility test data showed thatmost antibiotics had a higher rate of resistance in isolates of the O25b/ST131clonal type. Biofilm formation showed that there was a weak association betweenO25b/ST131 clone type isolates and the level of the biofilm formation. ERIC-PCRresults showed that E. coli isolates were genetically diverse and classified into14 groups. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the importance and highprevalence of E. coli O25b/ST131 among UTI isolates with the ability to spreadfast and disseminate antibiotic resistance genes.

TI  - Microbial degradation of antibiotic: future possibility of mitigating antibiotic pollution.
PG  - 639
LID - 10.1007/s10661-022-10314-2 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotics are the major pharmaceutical wastes that are being exposed to theenvironment from the pharmaceutical industries and for the anthropogenicactivities. The use of antibiotics for disease prevention and treatment in humanshas been surpassed by the amount used in agriculture, particularly on livestock. It is stipulated that the overuse of antibiotics is the single largest reasonbehind the rise of bacterial anti-microbial resistance (AMR). The development of alternative therapy, like gene therapy, immunotherapy, use of natural products,and various nanoparticles, to control bacterial pathogens might be an alternativeof antibiotics for mankind but the remediation of already exposed antibioticsfrom the lithosphere and hydrosphere needs to be envisioned with priority. Theever-increasing release of antibiotics in the environment makes it one of themajor emerging contaminants (ECs). Decomposition of such antibiotic contaminants is a great challenge to get a cleaner environment. There are reports describingthe degradation of antibiotics by photolysis, hydrolysis, using cathode and metalsalts, or by degradation via microbes. Antimicrobials like sulfonamides arerecalcitrant to natural biodegradation, exhibiting high thermal stability. There are recent reports on microbial degradation of a few common antibiotics and theirderivatives but their applications in waste management are scanty. It couldhowever be a major concern to the scientists whether to use the antibioticdegradation traits of a microbe for the removal of antibiotic wastes. Thecomplexity of the genetic clusters of a microbe that are responsible fordegradation is crucial, as a small genetic cluster might have higher chance ofhorizontal transfer into sensitive species of the normal microbial flora that in turn triggers the rise of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Different Responses of Bacteria and Microeukaryote to Assembly Processes andCo-occurrence Pattern in the Coastal Upwelling.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-022-02093-7 [doi]
AB  - Upwelling may generate unique hydrological and environmental heterogeneity,leading to enhanced diffusion to reshape microbial communities. However, itremains largely unknown how different microbial taxa respond to highly complexand dynamic upwelling systems. In the present study, geographic patterns andco-occurrence network of different microbial communities in response to upwellingwere examined. Our results showed that coastal upwelling shaped prokaryotic andeukaryotic microbial community and decreased their diversity. In addition,bacteria and microeukaryote had similar biogeographical patterns with distinctassembly mechanisms. The impact of stochastic processes on bacteria wassignificantly stronger compared with microeukaryote in upwelling. Lower networkcomplexity but more frequent interaction was found in upwelling microbialco-occurrence. However, the upwelling environment increased the robustness andmodularity of bacterial network, while eukaryotic network was just the opposite. Co-occurrence networks of bacteria and microeukaryote showed significantdistance-decay patterns, while the bacterial network had a stronger spatialvariation. Temperature and salinity were the strongest environmental factorsaffecting microbial coexistence, whereas the topological characteristics ofbacterial and eukaryotic networks had different responses to the upwellingenvironment. These findings expanded our understanding of biogeographic patterns of microbial community and ecological network and the underlying mechanisms ofdifferent microbial taxa in upwelling.

TI  - Fungal Communities Are More Sensitive to the Simulated Environmental Changes thanBacterial Communities in a Subtropical Forest: the Single and Interactive Effectsof Nitrogen Addition and Precipitation Seasonality Change.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-022-02092-8 [doi]
AB  - Increased nitrogen deposition (N factor) and changes in precipitation patterns (Wfactor) can greatly impact soil microbial communities in tropical/subtropicalforests. Although knowledge about the effects of a single factor on soilmicrobial communities is growing rapidly, little is understood about theinteractive effects of these two environmental change factors. In this study, we investigated the responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities to theshort-term simulated environmental changes (nitrogen addition, precipitationseasonality change, and their combination) in a subtropical forest in SouthChina. The interaction between N and W factors was detected significant foraffecting some soil physicochemical properties (such as pH, soil water, andNO3(-) contents). Fungi were more susceptible to treatment than bacteria in avariety of community traits (alpha, beta diversity, and network topologicalfeatures). The N and W factors act antagonistically to affect fungal alphadiversity, and the interaction effect was detected significant for the dryseason. The topological features of the meta-community (containing both bacteria and fungi) network overrode the alpha and beta diversity of bacterial or fungalcommunities in explaining the variation of soil enzyme activities. Theassociations between Ascomycota fungi and Gammaproteobacteria orAlphaproteobacteria might be important in mediating the inter-kingdominteractions. In summary, our results suggested that fungal communities were moresensitive to N and W factors (and their interaction) than bacterial communities, and the treatments' effects were more prominent in the dry season, which may havegreat consequences in soil processes and ecosystem functions in subtropicalforests.

TI  - Bordetella pertussis outer membrane vesicles as virulence factor vehicles thatinfluence bacterial interaction with macrophages.

LID - 10.1093/femspd/ftac031 [doi]
AB  - Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria constitutively shed outer membrane vesicles(OMVs) which play a significant role in the host-pathogen interaction, eventuallydetermining the outcome of the infection. We previously found that Bordetellapertussis, the etiological agent of whooping cough, survives the innateinteraction with human macrophages remaining alive inside these immune cells.Adenylate cyclase (CyaA), one of the main toxins of this pathogen, was foundinvolved in the modulation of the macrophage defense response, eventuallypromoting bacterial survival within the cells. We here investigated whether B.pertussis OMVs, loaded with most of the bacterial toxins and CyaA among them,modulate the macrophage response to the bacterial infection. We observed that thepre-incubation of macrophages with OMVs led to a decreased macrophage defenseresponse to the encounter with the bacteria, in a CyaA dependent way. Our resultssuggest that CyaA delivered by B. pertussis OMVs dampens macrophages protectivefunction by decreasing phagocytosis and the bactericidal capability of these hostcells. By increasing the chances of bacterial survival to the innate encounterwith the macrophages, B. pertussis OMVs might play a relevant role in the course of infection, promoting bacterial persistence within the host and eventually,shaping the whole infection process.

TI  - Autoinducer-fluorophore conjugates enable FRET in LuxR proteins in vitro and incells.
LID - 10.1038/s41589-022-01089-1 [doi]
AB  - Cell-to-cell signaling, or quorum sensing (QS), in many Gram-negative bacteria isgoverned by small molecule signals (N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones, AHLs) and theircognate receptors (LuxR-type proteins). The mechanistic underpinnings of QS inthese bacteria are severely limited due to the challenges of isolating andmanipulating most LuxR-type proteins. Reports of quantitative direct-bindingexperiments on LuxR-type proteins are scarce, and robust and generalizablemethods that provide such data are largely nonexistent. We report herein aForster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay that leverages (1) conservedtryptophans located in the LuxR-type protein ligand-binding site and syntheticfluorophore-AHL conjugates, and (2) isolation of the proteins bound to weakagonists. The FRET assay permits straightforward measurement of ligand-bindingaffinities with receptor-either in vitro or in cells-and was shown to becompatible with six LuxR-type proteins. These methods will advance fundamentalinvestigations of LuxR-type protein mechanism and the development of smallmolecule QS modulators.

TI  - Host taxonomy determines the composition, structure, and diversity of theearthworm cast microbiome under homogenous feeding conditions.
LID - fiac093 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiac093 [doi]
AB  - Host evolutionary history is a key factor shaping the earthworm cast microbiome, although its effect can be shadowed by the earthworm's diet. To untangle dietary from taxon effects, we raised nine earthworm species on a uniform diet of cowmanure and compared cast microbiome across species while controlling for diet.Our results showed that, under controlled laboratory conditions, earthwormmicrobiomes are species-specific, more diverse than that of the controlled diet, and mainly comprised of native bacteria (i.e., not acquired from the diet).Furthermore, diet has a medium to large convergence effect on microbiomecomposition since earthworms shared 16 to 74% of their bacterial ampliconsequence variants (ASV). The inter-species core microbiome included 10 ASVs,while their intra-species core microbiomes were larger and varied in ASV richness(24-48%) and sequence abundance across earthworm species. This specificity incore microbiomes and variable degree of similarity in bacterial compositionsuggest that phylosymbiosis could determine earthworm microbiome assembly.However, lack of congruence between the earthworm phylogeny and the microbiomedendrogram suggests that a consistent diet fed over several generations may have weakened potential phylosymbiotic effects. Thus, cast microbiome assembly inearthworms seem to be the result of an interplay among host phylogeny and diet.

AB  - We aimed to analyze the nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles in pregnant women withand without SARS-CoV-2 infection, considered a vulnerable population duringCOVID-19 pandemic. Pregnant women were enrolled from a multicenter prospectivepopulation-based cohort during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave in Spain (March-June2020 in Barcelona, Spain) in which the status of SARS-CoV-2 infection wasdetermined by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and antibodies in peripheral blood. Womenwere randomly selected for this cross-sectional study on microbiota. DNA wasextracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples, and the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA of bacteria was amplified using region-specific primers. The differentialabundance of taxa was tested, and alpha/beta diversity was evaluated. Among 76women, 38 were classified as positive and 38 as negative for SARS-CoV-2infection. All positive women were diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM/IgAantibodies, and 14 (37%) also had a positive RT-PCR. The overall composition ofthe nasopharyngeal microbiota differ in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies), compared to those without the infection(negative SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) (p = 0.001), with a higher relative abundance ofthe Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes phyla and a higher abundance of thePrevotellaceae family. Infected women presented a different pattern of microbiotaprofiling due to beta diversity and higher richness (observed ASV < 0.001) andevenness (Shannon index < 0.001) at alpha diversity. These changes were alsopresent in women after acute infection, as revealed by negative RT-PCR butpositive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting a potential association betweenSARS-CoV-2 infection and long-lasting shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiota. No significant differences were reported in mild vs. severe cases. This is the firststudy on nasopharyngeal microbiota during pregnancy. Pregnant women withSARS-CoV-2 infection had a different nasopharyngeal microbiota profile comparedto negative cases.

Although inexpensive, straightforward, and requiring a veryshort time commitment, these models recapitulate neither the functionality ofmulti-layered cell types nor the associated microbiome that occurs in a human.Animal models have commonly been used to recreate the complexity of humaninfections. However, extensive modifications of animal models are required torecreate interactions that resemble those in the human reproductive tract.Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models have emerged as alternative means ofreproducing vital elements of human infections at a fraction of the cost ofanimal models and on a scale that allows for replicative experiments. Here wedescribe a new 3D model that utilizes transwells with epithelial cells seededapically and a basolateral extracellular matrix (ECM)-like layer. The modelproduced tissues with morphologic and physiological resemblance to human cervicaland vaginal epithelia, including mucus levels produced by cervical cells.Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was demonstrated, aswell as the growth of bacterial species observed in the human vaginal microbiota.This enabled controlled mechanistic analyses of the interactions between hostcells, the vaginal microbiota and STI pathogens.

AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in childhood (childhood ADHD); two-thirds of affected individualscontinue to have ADHD in adulthood (persistent ADHD), and sometimes ADHD isdiagnosed in adulthood (late-diagnosed ADHD). We evaluated genetic differencesamong childhood (n = 14,878), persistent (n = 1,473) and late-diagnosed (n =6,961) ADHD cases alongside 38,303 controls, and rare variant differences in7,650 ADHD cases and 8,649 controls. We identified four genome-wide significantloci for childhood ADHD and one for late-diagnosed ADHD. We found increasedpolygenic scores for ADHD in persistent ADHD compared with the other two groups. Childhood ADHD had higher genetic overlap with hyperactivity and autism compared with late-diagnosed ADHD and the highest burden of rare protein-truncatingvariants in evolutionarily constrained genes. Late-diagnosed ADHD had a largergenetic overlap with depression than childhood ADHD and no increased burden inrare protein-truncating variants. Overall, these results suggest a geneticinfluence on age at first ADHD diagnosis, persistence of ADHD and the differentcomorbidity patterns among the groups.

AB  - While vaccination against HIV-1 has been so far unsuccessful, recently broadlyneutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein were shown toinduce long-term suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy in patientswith antibody-sensitive viral reservoirs. The requirement of neutralizingantibodies indicates that the antibody mediated removal (clearance) of HIV-1 initself is not efficient enough in these immune compromised patients. Here wepresent a novel, alternative approach that is independent of a functional immune system to clear HIV-1, by capturing the virus and redirecting it to non-targetcells where it is internalized and degraded. We use bispecific antibodies withdomains derived from small single chain Llama antibodies (VHHs). These bind with one domain to HIV-1 envelope proteins and with the other domain direct the virus to cells expressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor that isubiquitously expressed in the body. We show that HIV envelope proteins,virus-like particles and HIV-1 viruses (representing HIV-1 subtypes A, B and C)are efficiently recruited to EGFR, internalized and degraded in the lysosomalpathway at low nM concentrations of bispecific VHHs. This directed degradation innon-target cells may provide a clearance platform for the removal of viruses and other unwanted agents from the circulation, including toxins, and may thusprovide a novel method for curing.

PG  - 785
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03767-1 [doi]
AB  - The envelope glycoprotein GP of the ebolaviruses is essential for host cell entryand the primary target of the host antibody response. GP is heavily glycosylated with up to 17 N-linked sites, numerous O-linked glycans in its disorderedmucin-like domain (MLD), and three predicted C-linked mannosylation sites.Glycosylation is important for host cell attachment, GP stability and fusionactivity, and shielding from neutralization by serum antibodies. Here, we useglycoproteomics to profile the site-specific glycosylation patterns of ebolavirusGP. We detect up to 16 unique O-linked glycosylation sites in the MLD, and twoO-linked sites in the receptor-binding GP1 subunit. Multiple O-linked glycans areobserved within N-linked glycosylation sequons, suggesting crosstalk between the two types of modifications. We confirmed C-mannosylation of W288 in full-lengthtrimeric GP. We find complex glycosylation at the majority of N-linked sites,while the conserved sites N257 and especially N563 are enriched in unprocessedglycans, suggesting a role in host-cell attachment via DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. Ourfindings illustrate how N-, O-, and C-linked glycans together build theheterogeneous glycan shield of GP, guiding future immunological studies andfunctional interpretation of ebolavirus GP-antibody interactions.

AB  - 103 bacterial isolates obtained from 8 ethnomedicinal plants in Manipur, Indiawere studied for antifungal and plant growth promoting (PGP) activities.Forty-six (46), out of 62 antifungal isolates, showed potent activities againstR. solani. Since R. solani (RS), a sheath blight pathogen, threatens rice yields worldwide, the present study was aimed at discovering promising bioinoculantswith anti-RS and PGP potential on rice. Twenty-nine (29) endophytic isolatesexhibiting promising anti-RS and PGP activities were subjected to seed vigorassays on rice (var. Jatra) and 16 were found to enhance rice seedling vigour by 70% or more over the control. Four (4) strains, Streptomyces sp. (AcRz21),Alkalihalobacillus sp. (PtL11), Bacillus sp. (TgIb5), and Priestia sp. (TgIb12)with the highest vigor indices were studied for growth promotion of rice in fieldconditions under pathogen-challenged and pathogen-free conditions. Thesebioactive strains were able to significantly enhance root and shoot biomass andreduce lesion heights caused by R. solani.

AB  - A new positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) mycovirus, Verticillium dahliaemagoulivirus 1 (VdMoV1), was isolated from two strains (2-19 and XLZ70) ofVerticillium dahliae. The complete genome of VdMoV1 is 2303 nucleotides (nt) inlength and has a large open reading frame (nt positions from 61 to 1938) encodingan RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A multiple sequence alignment indicatedthat the central region of the RdRp encoded by VdMoV1 contains eight typicalviral RdRp motifs. BLASTp analysis demonstrated that VdMoV1 has the highestsequence identity (86.88%) to Bremia lactucae associated ourmia-like virus 2(BlaOLV2). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that VdMoV1 is a new member of thegenus Magoulivirus. As far as we know, VdMoV1 is the first reported member of thefamily Botourmiaviridae infecting V. dahliae.

TI  - Immune responses and protective immunity in Pangasius pangasius (Hamilton, 1822) as induced by outer membrane proteins of Edwardsiella tarda and aluminiumhydroxide adjuvant complex.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09978-5 [doi]
AB  - Edwardsiella tarda is considered one of the important bacterial fish pathogens.The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of E. tarda are structurally and functionally conserved, and immunogenic. This study assessed the effects of the OMPs of E.tarda CGH9 as a vaccine without aluminium hydroxide [AH] (T1) and with AHadjuvant (T2) on the respiratory burst (ROB) activity, lymphocyte proliferationof head kidney (HK) leukocytes, and serum antibody production in pangas catfishPangasius pangasius. The ROB activity and lymphocyte proliferation of HKleukocytes increased in both vaccinated groups compared to the control.Nonetheless, the T2 group showed a gradual increase in ROB activity andlymphocyte proliferation of HK leukocytes up to 3-weeks post-vaccination (wpv).The serum antibody production in the T1 group decreased initially for up to 2-wpvand increased from 3-wpv; whereas, in the T2 group, the serum-specific antibodylevels were significantly high from 1-wpv compared to control. Simultaneously,the protective efficacy in terms of relative percentage survival in the T2 group after injecting with a lethal dose of E. tarda CGH9 was high (89.00+/-15.56)compared to the T1 group (78.00+/-0.00). Furthermore, the catfish administeredwith a booster dose of E. tarda OMPs with or without AH adjuvant showed noadditional increase in immune response or protective immunity. These resultssuggested that E. tarda OMPs and AH adjuvant complex has a higher potential toinduce protective immunity, which may be a good choice as a vaccine to combat E. tarda infection in catfish.

TI  - Metagenomic views on taxonomic and functional profiles of the Himalayan Tsomgocold lake and unveiling its deterzome potential.
LID - 10.1007/s00294-022-01247-x [doi]
AB  - Cold habitat is considered a potential source for detergent industry enzymes.This study aims at the metagenomic investigation of Tsomgo lake for taxonomic andfunctional annotation, unveiling the deterzome potential of the residingmicrobiota at this site. The present investigation revealed molecular profilingof microbial community structure and functional potential of the high-altitudeTsomgo lake samples of two different temperatures, harvested during March andAugust. Bacteria were found to be the most dominant phyla, with traces of genomicpieces of evidence belonging to archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were noted to be the most abundant bacterial phyla in the coldlake. In-depth metagenomic investigation of the cold aquatic habitat revealednovel genes encoding detergent enzymes, amylase, protease, and lipase. Further,metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to the psychrophilic bacterium,Arthrobacter alpinus, were constructed from the metagenomic data. The annotation depicted the presence of detergent enzymes and genes for low-temperatureadaptation in Arthrobacter alpinus. Psychrophilic microbial isolates werescreened for lipase, protease, and amylase activities to further strengthen themetagenomic findings. A novel strain of Acinetobacter sp. was identified with thedual enzymatic activity of protease and amylase. The bacterial isolates exhibitedhydrolyzing activity at low temperatures. This metagenomic study divulged novelgenomic resources for detergent industry enzymes, and the bacterial isolatessecreting cold-active amylase, lipase, and protease enzymes. The findingsmanifest that Tsomgo lake is a potential bioresource of cold-active enzymes,vital for various industrial applications.

LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01184-y [doi]
AB  - Early development of the microbiome has been shown to affect general health andphysical development of the infant and, although some studies have beenundertaken in high-income countries, there are few studies from low- andmiddle-income countries. As part of the BARNARDS study, we examined the rectalmicrobiota of 2,931 neonates (term used up to 60 d) with clinical signs of sepsisand of 15,217 mothers screening for blaCTX-M-15, blaNDM, blaKPC andblaOXA-48-like genes, which were detected in 56.1%, 18.5%, 0% and 4.1% ofneonates' rectal swabs and 47.1%, 4.6%, 0% and 1.6% of mothers' rectal swabs,respectively. Carbapenemase-positive bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF MS andshowed a high diversity of bacterial species (57 distinct species/genera) whichexhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae/E. cloacae complex, the mostcommonly found isolates, were subjected to whole-genome sequencing analysis andrevealed close relationships between isolates from different samples, suggesting transmission of bacteria between neonates, and between neonates and mothers.Associations between the carriage of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) andhealthcare/environmental factors were identified, and the presence of ARGs was a predictor of neonatal sepsis and adverse birth outcomes.

TI  - Bacterial communities of hookah tobacco products are diverse and differ acrossbrands and flavors.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12079-7 [doi]
AB  - Young adults are increasingly using non-cigarette products, such as hookahs,since they are perceived as healthier alternatives to cigarette smoking. However,hookah users are exposed to not only carcinogenic compounds but alsomicroorganisms that may play an active role in the development of both infectiousand chronic diseases among users. Nevertheless, existing hookah research in this area has focused only on microorganisms that may be transferred to users through the smoking apparatus and not on bacterial communities associated with hookahtobacco. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted time-series experiments oncommercially available hookah brands (Al Fakher (flavors: two apple, mint, andwatermelon) and Fumari (flavors: white gummy bear, ambrosia, and mint chocolatechill)) stored under three different temperature and relative humidity conditionsover 14 days. To characterize bacterial communities, the total DNA was extracted on days 0, 5, 9, and 14, PCR-amplified for the V3V4 region of the bacterial 16SrRNA gene, sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform, and analyzed using R.Diversity (alpha and beta) analyses revealed that the microbiotas of Fumari andAl Fakher products differed significantly and that flavor had a significanteffect on the hookah microbiota. Overall, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Sphingomonas,and Methylobacterium were the predominant bacterial taxa across all products.Additionally, we observed compositional differences between hookah brands across the 14-day incubation. These data suggest that the bacterial communities ofhookah tobacco are diverse and differ across brands and flavors, which may havecritical implications regarding exposures to specific bacteria among hookahusers. KEY POINTS: * Commercial hookah products harbor diverse bacterialcommunities. * Brands and flavors impact the diversity of these communities. *Research on their viability and transmission to users' respiratory tracts isneeded.

TI  - Nutritional stress induced intraspecies competition revealed by transcriptomeanalysis in Sphingomonas melonis TY.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12097-5 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria have developed various mechanisms by which they can compete or cooperatewith other bacteria. This study showed that in the cocultures of wild-typeSphingomonas melonis TY and its isogenic mutant TYDeltandpD grow with nicotine,the former can outcompete the latter. TYDeltandpD undergoes growth arrest afterfour days when cocultured with wild-type TY, whereas the coculture has justentered a stationary phase and the substrate was nearly depleted, and theinteraction between the two related strains was revealed by transcriptomicanalysis. Analysis of the differential expression genes indicated that wild-type TY inhibited the growth of TYDeltandpD mainly through toxin-antitoxin (TA)systems. The four upregulated antitoxin coding genes belong to type II TA systemsin which the bactericidal effect of the cognate toxin was mainly throughinhibition of translation or DNA replication, whereas wild-type TY withupregulated antitoxin genes can regenerate cognate immunity protein continuously and thus prevent the lethal action of toxin to itself. In addition,colicin-mediated antibacterial activity against closely related species may also be involved in the competition between wild-type TY and TYDeltandpD undernutritional stress. Moreover, upregulation of carbon and nitrogen catabolismrelated-, stress response related-, DNA repair related-, and DNAreplication-related genes in wild-type TY showed that it triggered a series ofresponse mechanisms when facing dual stress of competition from isogenic mutantcells and nutritional limitation. Thus, we proposed that S. melonis TY employedthe TA systems and colicin to compete with TYDeltandpD under nutritional stress, thereby maximally acquiring and exploiting finite resources. KEY POINTS: *Cross-feeding between isogenic mutants and the wild-type strain. * Nutritionstress caused a shift from cooperation to competition. * TYDeltandpD undergogrowth arrest by exogenous and endogenous toxins.

AB  - Various omics-based biomarkers related to the occurrence, progression, andprognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been identified. In this study, weattempted to identify gut microbiome-based biomarkers and detect theirassociation with host gene expression in the initiation and progression of CRC byintegrating analysis of the gut mucosal metagenome, RNA sequencing, andsociomedical factors. We performed metagenome and RNA sequencing on colonicmucosa samples from 13 patients with advanced CRC (ACRC), 10 patients withhigh-risk adenoma (HRA), and 7 normal control (NC) individuals. All participants completed a questionnaire on sociomedical factors. The interaction andcorrelation between changes in the microbiome and gene expression were assessedusing bioinformatic analysis. When comparing HRA and NC samples, which can beconsidered to represent the process of tumor initiation, 28 genes and fivemicrobiome species were analyzed with correlation plots. When comparing ACRC and HRA samples, which can be considered to represent the progression of CRC, sevenbacterial species and 21 genes were analyzed. When comparing ACRC and NC samples,16 genes and five bacterial species were analyzed, and four correlation plotswere generated. A network visualizing the relationship between bacterial and hostgene expression in the initiation and progression of CRC indicated thatClostridium spiroforme and Tyzzerella nexilis were hub bacteria in thedevelopment and progression of CRC. Our study revealed the interactions of andcorrelation between the colonic mucosal microbiome and host gene expression toidentify potential roles of the microbiome in the initiation and progression ofCRC. Our results provide gut microbiome-based biomarkers that may be potentialdiagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in patients with CRC.

TI  - First report of Przhevalskiana silenus derived recombinant hypodermin C basedindirect ELISA for serodiagnosis of goat warble fly myiasis.
PG  - 13440
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17760-5 [doi]
AB  - Goat warble fly infestation (GWFI) is a subcutaneous myiasis caused by larvae of Przhevalskiana silenus, an insect belonging to the order Diptera. The diagnosisof GWFI is challenging in the early larval instars (L1 and L2) as they are occultunder the skin and hair coat causing prolonged economic loss in form of meat and hide damage. This necessitates early diagnosis for disease control at herd level and its prophylactic management to prevent economic losses. Hypodermins, a class of serine proteases from Hypoderminae subfamily have been used as serodiagnostic antigens for the past four decades for diagnosis of warble fly myiasis. In thisstudy,the immunodominant antigen Hypodermin C (HyC) from P. silenus has beenrecombinantly expressed in E. coli and immunogenic characterisation of expressed protein was done. The protein shows hallmark residues in conserved cysteine andcatalytic triad typical of serine proteases along with similar profile ofimmunoreactivity towards Hypoderminae infestation. The present study reports anoptimised indirect-ELISA based on recombinant HyC derived from P. silenus forearly diagnosis of GWFI. The optimised indirect ELISA provides a sensitive andspecific immunodiagnostic for mass surveillance of the GWFI with diagnosticspecificity and sensitivity of 96% and 100%, respectively and not showing anycross reactivity against other important parasitic and bacterial diseases ofgoats. This study presents the first report of indirect ELISA based onrecombinant Hypodermin C antigen derived from P. silenus for the serosurveillanceof goat warble fly disease.

AB  - Plague has caused three worldwide pandemics in history, including the Black Deathin medieval ages. Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague, has evolved apowerful arsenal to disrupt host immune defenses during evolution fromenteropathogenic Y. pseudotuberculosis. Here, we find that two functionallyredundant E3 ligase of Y. pestis, YspE1 and YspE2, can be delivered via type III secretion injectisome into host cytosol where they ubiquitinate multipleguanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) for proteasomal degradation. However, Y.pseudotuberculosis has no such capability due to lacking functional YspE1/2homologs. YspE1/2-mediated GBP degradations significantly promote the survival ofY. pestis in macrophages and strongly inhibit inflammasome activation. Bycontrast, Gbp(chr3-/-, chr5-/-) macrophages exhibit much lowered inflammasomeactivation independent of YspE1/2, accompanied with an enhanced replication of Y.pestis. Accordingly, Gbp(chr3-/-, chr5-/-) mice are more susceptible to Y.pestis. We demonstrate that Y. pestis utilizes E3 ligases to subvert GBP-mediatedhost defense, which appears to be newly acquired by Y. pestis during evolution.

AB  - Immunocompromised patients are predisposed to severe COVID-19. Here we comparehomotypic and heterotypic humoral and cellular immune responses to Omicron BA.1in organ transplant patients across a diverse clinical spectrum. We performvariant-specific pseudovirus neutralization assays for D614G, and Omicron-BA.1,-BA.2, and Delta variants. We also measure poly-and monofunctional T-cellresponses to BA.1 and ancestral SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. We identify thatpartially or fully-vaccinated transplant recipients after infection with Omicron BA.1 have the greatest BA.1 neutralizing antibody and BA.1-specificpolyfunctional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses, with potentcross-neutralization against BA.2. In these patients, the magnitude of theBA.1-directed response is comparable to immunocompetent triple-vaccinatedcontrols. A subset of patients with pre-Omicron infection have heterotypicresponses to BA.1 and BA.2, whereas uninfected transplant patients with threedoses of vaccine demonstrate the weakest comparative responses. These resultshave implications for risk of infection, re-infection, and disease severity amongimmune compromised hosts with Omicron infection.

PG  - 4543
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32174-7 [doi]
AB  - Bites by elapid snakes (e.g. cobras) can result in life-threatening paralysiscaused by venom neurotoxins blocking neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholinereceptors. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structure of the muscle-type Torpedoreceptor in complex with ScNtx, a recombinant short-chain alpha-neurotoxin. ScNtxis pinched between loop C on the principal subunit and a unique hairpin in loop Fon the complementary subunit, thereby blocking access to the neurotransmitterbinding site. ScNtx adopts a binding mode that is tilted toward the complementarysubunit, forming a wider network of interactions than those seen in thelong-chain alpha-Bungarotoxin complex. Certain mutations in ScNtx at thetoxin-receptor interface eliminate inhibition of neuronal alpha7 nAChRs, but not of human muscle-type receptors. These observations explain why ScNtx binds moretightly to muscle-type receptors than neuronal receptors. Together, these dataoffer a framework for understanding subtype-specific actions of short-chainalpha-neurotoxins and inspire strategies for design of new snake antivenoms.

AB  - Ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation are the essential signs of NASH.However, the molecular mechanisms of ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression are not fully understood. Here we reported that hepaticWilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a key integrative regulator ofectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression. Hepaticdeletion of Wtap leads to NASH due to the increased lipolysis in white adiposetissue, enhanced hepatic free fatty acids uptake and induced inflammation, all ofwhich are mediated by IGFBP1, CD36 and cytochemokines such as CCL2, respectively.WTAP binds to specific DNA motifs which are enriched in the promoters andsuppresses gene expression (e.g., Igfbp1, Cd36 and Ccl2) with the involvement of HDAC1. In NASH, WTAP is tranlocated from nucleus to cytosol, which is related to CDK9-mediated phosphorylation. These data uncover a mechanism by which hepaticWTAP regulates ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASHprogression.

AB  - Delineating the origins and properties of antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2infection and vaccination is critical for understanding their benefits andpotential shortcomings. Therefore, we investigate the SARS-CoV-2 spike(S)-reactive B cell repertoire in unexposed individuals by flow cytometry andsingle-cell sequencing. We show that approximately 82% of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive Bcells harbor a naive phenotype, which represents an unusually high fraction oftotal human naive B cells ( approximately 0.1%). Approximately 10% of these naiveS-reactive B cells share an IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing, anenrichment of 18-fold compared to the complete naive repertoire. FollowingSARS-CoV-2 infection, we report an average 37-fold enrichment ofIGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing in the S-reactive memory B cellscompared to the unselected memory repertoire. This class of B cells targets apreviously undefined non-neutralizing epitope on the S2 subunit that becomesexposed on S proteins used in approved vaccines when they transition away fromthe native pre-fusion state because of instability. These findings can help guidethe improvement of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

AB  - The malaria parasite Plasmodium invades a host erythrocyte, multiplies within aparasitophorous vacuole (PV) and then ruptures the PV and erythrocyte membranesin a process known as egress. Both egress and invasion are controlled by effectorproteins discharged from specialized secretory organelles. The aspartic protease plasmepsin X (PM X) regulates activity for many of these effectors, but it isunclear how PM X accesses its diverse substrates that reside in differentorganelles. PM X also autoprocesses to generate different isoforms. The function of this processing is not understood. We have mapped the self-cleavage sites and have constructed parasites with cleavage site mutations. Surprisingly, aquadruple mutant that remains full-length retains in vitro activity, istrafficked normally, and supports normal egress, invasion and parasite growth.The N-terminal half of the prodomain stays bound to the catalytic domain evenafter processing and is required for proper intracellular trafficking of PM X. Wefind that this enzyme cleaves microneme and exoneme substrates before discharge, while the rhoptry substrates that are dependent on PM X activity are cleavedafter exoneme discharge into the PV. The data give insight into the temporal,spatial and biochemical control of this unusual but important aspartic protease.

TI  - Climate windows of opportunity for plant expansion during the Phanerozoic.
PG  - 4530
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32077-7 [doi]
AB  - Earth's long-term climate may have profoundly influenced plant evolution. Localclimatic factors, including water availability, light, and temperature, play akey role in plant physiology and growth, and have fluctuated substantially overgeological time. However, the impact of these key climate variables on globalplant biomass across the Phanerozoic has not yet been established. Linkingclimate and dynamic vegetation modelling, we identify two key 'windows ofopportunity' during the Ordovician and Jurassic-Paleogene capable of supportingdramatic expansions of potential plant biomass. These conditions are driven bycontinental dispersion, paleolatitude of continental area and a lack ofglaciation, allowing for an intense hydrological cycle and greater wateravailability. These windows coincide with the initial expansion of land plantsand the later angiosperm radiation. Our findings suggest that the timing andexpansion of habitable space for plants played an important role in plantevolution and diversification.

LID - 10.1038/s41514-022-00082-1 [doi]
AB  - Mexican Americans (MAs) are the fastest-growing Hispanic population segment inthe US; as this population increases in age, so will the societal burden ofage-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage may be implicated in MA AD risk since metabolic comorbidities are moreprevalent in this group. Oxidative damage to guanosine (8oxoG) is one of the mostprevalent DNA lesions and a putative indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction.Testing blood samples from participants of the Texas Alzheimer's Research andCare Consortium, we found mtDNA 8oxoG mutational load to be significantly higher in MAs compared to non-Hispanic whites and that MA females are differentiallyaffected. Furthermore, we identified specific mtDNA haplotypes that conferincreased risk for oxidative damage and suggestive evidence that cognitivefunction may be related to 8oxoG burden. Our understanding of these phenomenawill elucidate population- and sex-specific mechanisms of AD pathogenesis,informing the development of more precise interventions and therapeuticapproaches for MAs with AD in the future.

PG  - 4471
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-31907-y [doi]
AB  - Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are found widely inbacteria and archaea and consist of three structural domains, a solublesubstrate-binding protein (P-domain), and two transmembrane domains (Q- andM-domains). HiSiaPQM and its homologs are TRAP transporters for sialic acid andare essential for host colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Here, we reconstituteHiSiaQM into lipid nanodiscs and use cryo-EM to reveal the structure of a TRAPtransporter. It is composed of 16 transmembrane helices that are unexpectedlystructurally related to multimeric elevator-type transporters. The idiosyncratic Q-domain of TRAP transporters enables the formation of a monomeric elevatorarchitecture. A model of the tripartite PQM complex is experimentally validatedand reveals the coupling of the substrate-binding protein to the transporterdomains. We use single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)microscopy in solid-supported lipid bilayers and surface plasmon resonance tostudy the formation of the tripartite complex and to investigate the impact ofinterface mutants. Furthermore, we characterize high-affinity single variabledomains on heavy chain (VHH) antibodies that bind to the periplasmic side ofHiSiaQM and inhibit sialic acid uptake, providing insight into how TRAPtransporter function might be inhibited in vivo.

AB  - Bacterial topoisomerase I (TopoI) removes excessive negative supercoiling and is thought to relax DNA molecules during transcription, replication and otherprocesses. Using ChIP-Seq, we show that TopoI of Escherichia coli (EcTopoI) iscolocalized, genome-wide, with transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP). Treatment withtranscription elongation inhibitor rifampicin leads to EcTopoI relocation topromoter regions, where RNAP also accumulates. When a 14 kDa RNAP-binding EcTopoIC-terminal domain (CTD) is overexpressed, colocalization of EcTopoI and RNAPalong the transcription units is reduced. Pull-down experiments directly showthat the two enzymes interact in vivo. Using ChIP-Seq and Topo-Seq, wedemonstrate that EcTopoI is enriched upstream (within up to 12-15 kb) ofhighly-active transcription units, indicating that EcTopoI relaxes negativesupercoiling generated by transcription. Uncoupling of the RNAP:EcTopoIinteraction by either overexpression of EcTopoI competitor (CTD or inactiveEcTopoI Y319F mutant) or deletion of EcTopoI domains involved in the interaction is toxic for cells and leads to excessive negative plasmid supercoiling.Moreover, uncoupling of the RNAP:EcTopoI interaction leads to R-loopsaccumulation genome-wide, indicating that this interaction is required forprevention of R-loops formation.

TI  - BK polyomavirus in Iranian Patients with Papillary Thyroid Cancer: Is It a Major Future Challenge?
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28047 [doi]
AB  - BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a well-known cause of nephropathy in renal transplant recipients. It has recently received much attention from researchers as a majorpredisposing factor for various cancers. This study aimed to investigate howBKPyV affected the advancement of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). A total of1057 samples were tested for BKPyV DNA and RNA, comprising 645 paraffin-embedded PTC biopsy samples (PEBS), 412 fresh biopsy samples (FBS), and 1057 adjacentnon-cancerous samples. The BKPyV DNA was found in 511 (48.3%) of the specimens,including 347 (84.2%) FBS and 164 (25.4%) PEBS. The mean BKPyV copy number wassignificantly lower in patients with PEBS (0.5 x 10(-4) +/- 0.1 x 10(-4)copies/cell) than in FBS (1.3 x 10(-1) +/- 0.2 x 10(-1) copies/cell) and non-PTC normal samples (0.3 x 10(-5) +/- 0.04 x 10(-5) copies/cell). The PEBS had lowerLT-Ag RNA expression than FBS, and no VP1 gene transcript expression wasdetected. In conclusion, although our findings indicated the presence of BKPyV insome Iranian PTC patients, more research is needed to corroborate these findings.This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Increasing seroprevalence but waning herd immunity against measles afterelimination: Longitudinal seroepidemiology of measles in Osaka Prefecture, Japan,2003-2020.
LID - S0264-410X(22)00909-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.07.025 [doi]
AB  - Japan is one of the countries conducting longitudinal serosurveillance ofvaccine-preventable diseases. We conducted surveillance of the localmeasles-specific antibody titer, calculated the effective reproduction number(Re), and compared data of four terms: term 1, 2003-2006 (before the introductionof the second shot of measles-containing vaccine); term 2, 2007-2010 (early term toward measles elimination); term 3, 2011-2014 (later term toward measleselimination); and term 4, 2015-2020 (after elimination of measles in Japan).Approximately 250 sera from volunteers aged 0 to >/= 40 years were collected and examined for measles-specific IgG using the gelatin particle agglutination (PA)method annually from 2003 to 2020. Seroprevalence and the geometric mean of thePA antibody titer were examined by term. Re was calculated using theage-dependent proportion immune and contact matrix for each term. Of the 4,716sera, 886 in term 1, 1,217 in term 2, 1,069 in term 3, and 1,544 in term 4 werecollected. The seroprevalence gradually increased from term 1 (88.3% CI86.0-90.3) to term 4 (95.7% CI 94.6-96.7), and the seroprevalence of term 1 wassignificantly lower than those of other terms (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001),with PA titer >/= 16 as positive. By contrast, PA antibody titers significantlydecreased from term 1 (median 1,024) to term 4 (median 256) (Mann-Whitney U test,p < 0.001). With the protection level (PA titer >/= 128 and >/= 256) as positive,Re gradually increased from term 1 (1.8 and 2.3) to term 4 (2.5 and 4.8,respectively). Waning levels of measles antibodies potentially increase themeasles susceptibility in Osaka, Japan. This trend might imply a limitation ofvaccine-induced immunity in the absence of a natural booster for wild strainsafter measles elimination. This study provides a cue for maintaining continuousmeasles elimination status in the future.

TI  - CpG 1018(R) adjuvant enhances Tdap immune responses against Bordetella pertussis in mice.

LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.07.030 [doi]
AB  - Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of whooping cough (pertussis), asevere respiratory disease that can be fatal, particularly in infants. Despitehigh vaccine coverage, pertussis remains a problem because the currently usedDTaP and Tdap vaccines do not completely prevent infection or transmission. It iswell established that the alum adjuvant is a potential weakness of the acellular vaccines because the immunity provided by it is short-term. We aimed to evaluate the potential of CpG 1018(R) adjuvant to improve antibody responses and enhanceprotection against B. pertussis challenge in a murine model. A titrated range of Tdap vaccine doses were evaluated in order to best identify the adjuvantcapability of CpG 1018. Antibody responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentoushemagglutinin (FHA), or the whole bacterium were increased due to the inclusionof CpG 1018. In B. pertussis intranasal challenge studies, we observed improvedprotection and bacterial clearance from the lower respiratory tract due to addingCpG 1018 to 1/20th the human dose of Tdap. Further, we determined that Tdap andTdap + CpG 1018 were both capable of facilitating clearance of strains that donot express pertactin (PRN(-)), which are rising in prevalence. Functionalphenotyping of antibodies revealed that the inclusion of CpG 1018 induced morebacterial opsonization and antibodies of the Th1 phenotype (IgG2a and IgG2b).This study demonstrates the potential of adding CpG 1018 to Tdap to improveimmunogenicity and protection against B. pertussis compared to the conventional, alum-only adjuvanted Tdap vaccine.

LID - 10.1016/j.jbiosc.2022.07.007 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriocin production in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has always been consideredas a highly desirable trait as it enhances the strain's utility in differentindustrial applications. Bacteriocin producing LAB strains are considered to havehigher bacterial fitness as they are able to easily establish themselves intotarget microbial niche and hence are more effective starter cultures in foodfermentation and/or probiotic strains. The rapid advancement in genomic research revealed the true bacteriocin producing capacity of some select novel LAB strainscapable of producing multiple bacteriocins which further improves their utilityin different application systems. What is common to these novel strains is theremarkable sharing of some elements in the biosynthetic process enabling them to accomplish the extraordinary feat of producing multiple bacteriocins withoutexhausting its energy. Contrary to the common understanding that biosyntheticenzymes are specific to their cognate bacteriocins, multiple bacteriocinproducing strains employ shared biosynthetic elements between their multiplebacteriocins. The quorum-sensing three-component regulatory system, bacteriocinmaturation and transport mechanisms are shared among multiple bacteriocins inthese strains. Nevertheless, although these novel strains possess enormousapplication potential, their safety with regards to their potential virulence andpathogenicity needs to be confirmed through comprehensive genotypiccharacterization. Here, we compile the occurrence of multiple bacteriocinproduction in some novel LAB strains and highlight specific examples of theunique sharing mechanism of its biosynthetic machinery because a goodunderstanding how these novel strains synthesize their multiple bacteriocins can aid in maximizing their application potential.

TI  - Yeast ORC sumoylation status fine-tunes origin licensing.
LID - 10.1101/gad.349610.122 [doi]
AB  - Sumoylation is emerging as a posttranslation modification important forregulating chromosome duplication and stability. The origin recognition complex(ORC) that directs DNA replication initiation by loading the MCM replicativehelicase onto origins is sumoylated in both yeast and human cells. However, thebiological consequences of ORC sumoylation are unclear. Here we report theeffects of hypersumoylation and hyposumoylation of yeast ORC on ORC activity and origin function using multiple approaches. ORC hypersumoylation preferentiallyreduced the function of a subset of early origins, while Orc2 hyposumoylation hadan opposing effect. Mechanistically, ORC hypersumoylation reduced MCM loading in vitro and diminished MCM chromatin association in vivo. Either hypersumoylationor hyposumoylation of ORC resulted in genome instability and the dependence ofyeast on other genome maintenance factors, providing evidence that appropriateORC sumoylation levels are important for cell fitness. Thus, yeast ORCsumoylation status must be properly controlled to achieve optimal origin functionacross the genome and genome stability.

LID - e202201432 [pii]
LID - 10.26508/lsa.202201432 [doi]
AB  - Human milk is important for antimicrobial defense in infants and has welldemonstrated antiviral activity. We evaluated the protective ability of humanmilk against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection in a human fetal intestinal cell culture model. We found that, in this model, human milk blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication, irrespective of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies. Complete inhibition of both envelopedMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human respiratory syncytialvirus infections was also observed, whereas no inhibition of non-envelopedenterovirus A71 infection was seen. Transcriptome analysis after 24 h of theintestinal monolayers treated with human milk showed large transcriptomic changesfrom human milk treatment, and subsequent analysis suggested that ATP1A1down-regulation by milk might be of importance. Inhibition of ATP1A1 blockedSARS-CoV-2 infection in our intestinal model, whereas no effect on EV-A71infection was seen. Our data indicate that human milk has potent antiviralactivity against particular (enveloped) viruses by potentially blocking theATP1A1-mediated endocytic process.

AB  - The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and the limited efficacy of current available antibiotics cause every year approximately 700000 deaths peryear. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect and antibacterialpotential of the ibuprofen derivative Methyl 2-(-4-isobutylphenyl)propanoate(MET-IBU). The molecular structure of MET-IBU was confirmed by Nuclear MagneticResonance (NMR) and, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infraredspectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Our in vivo study using adult zebrafishmodel demonstrated that the ibuprofen derivative MET-IBU also possessesanti-inflammatory effect, and in vitro antibacterial activity assays showed that in the association of ampicillin, norfloxacin, and gentamicin with MET-IBUoccurred reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for MDRbacterial strains of Escherichia coli 06 and Staphylococcus aureus 10, indicatinga potentiating in the growth inhibition of these pathogenic bacteria. Regardingthe strain of Staphylococcus aureus K2068 (overexpressing mepA gene), apotentiation of ethidium bromide was found in the association with MET-IBU,indicating the action of this compound on the efflux pump mechanism present inthis strains result corroborates the molecular docking study that indicated agreater affinity of the MET-IBU with the MepA efflux pump. This resultcorroborates the molecular docking study that indicated a high affinity of theMET-IBU with the MepA efflux pump. It was also noticed an antibiotic potentiatingactivity in the association MET-IBU with norfloxacin against strains ofStaphylococcus aureus 1199B (overexpressing norA gene) when compared to thenorfloxacin control. This enhanced antibiotic effect of MET-IBU is associatedwith a second resistance mechanism, which is due to the modification in thetopoisomerase enzyme. These results bring attention to the ibuprofen derivativeMET-IBU as possible candidate for the development of new options for thetreatment of bacterial infections with protective anti-inflammatory action.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to analyze face touching patterns withand without face mask. METHODS: The behavior of face touching with and without a mask during an interview was assessed in forty individuals. The frequency oftouching in different areas of the face covered by the mask was compared to areasnot covered by the face mask. RESULTS: There was an increase in the number ofindividuals who touched the hair and the eye, when they were not wearing themask. There was an increase in the number of touches on the lips and hair whenindividuals were not wearing the face mask. When analysing the area covered byface mask, no difference was observed on the number of touches while using or notusing masks. However, when area not covered by face mask was analysed, highernumber of touches in individuals without masks was observed when compared toindividuals wearing masks. CONCLUSION: The use of face mask can reduce or change the face touching patterns in normal individuals, especially in areas not coveredby the mask. The use of face mask can possibly reduce the chances of beinginfected by auto-inoculation.

AB  - The small intestine is a highly adaptable organ serving as both a barrier to the external environment and a conduit for nutrient absorption. Enterocytes packagedietary triglycerides (TG) into chylomicrons for transport into circulation; the remaining TGs are stored in cytosolic lipid droplets (CLDs). The current studyaimed to characterize the impact of diet composition on intestinal lipid handlingin male and female wild-type mice. Mice were continued on their grain-based diet (GBD) and switched to a high-fat, high cholesterol Western-style diet (WD) or aketogenic diet (KD) for 3 or 5weeks. KD-fed mice displayed significantly higherplasma TG levels in response to an olive oil gavage than WD- and GBD-fed mice; TGlevels were ~2-fold higher in male KD-fed mice than female KD-fed mice.Poloxamer-407 experiments revealed enhanced intestinal-TG secretion rates in malemice fed a KD upon olive oil gavage, whereas secretion rates were unchanged infemale mice. Surprisingly, jejunal CLD size and TG mass after oil gavage weresimilar among the groups. At fasting, TG mass was significantly higher in thejejunum of male KD-fed mice and the duodenum of female KD-fed mice, providingincreased substrate for chylomicron formation. In addition to greater fastingintestinal TG stores, KD-fed male mice displayed longer small intestinal lengths,while female mice displayed markedly longer jejunal villi lengths. After 5week ofdiet, 12h fasting-2h refeeding experiments revealed jejunal TG levels weresimilar between diet groups in male mice; however, in female mice, jejunal TGmass was significantly higher in KD-fed mice compared to GBD- and WD-fed mice.These experiments reveal that KD feeding promotes distinct morphological andfunctional changes to the small intestine compared to the WD diet. Moreover,changes to intestinal lipid handling in response to carbohydrate and proteinrestriction manifest differently in male and female mice.

AB  - Abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA) is a complex immunological disease with a strong genetic component, and one of the ten leading causes of death of individuals55-74years old worldwide. Strong evidence has been accumulated suggesting thatAAA is an autoimmune specific antigen-driven disease. Mononuclear cellsinfiltrating AAA lesions comprised of T and B lymphocytes and other cellsexpressing early-, intermediate- and late-activation antigens, and the presenceof antigen-presenting cells have been documented, demonstrating an ongoing immuneresponse. The three components of the trimolecular complex, T-cell receptor(TCR)/peptide (antigen)/HLA have been identified in AAA, and specifically: (i)clonal expansions of T-cell clones in AAA lesions; (ii) the association of AAAwith particular HLA Class I and Class II; and (iii) self or nonself putativeAAA-associated antigens. IgG autoantibodies recognizing proteins present innormal aortic tissue have been reported in patients with AAA. Molecular mimicry, defined as the sharing of antigenic epitopes between microorganisms (bacteria,viruses) and self antigens, maybe is responsible for T-cell responses andantibody production in AAA. Also, the frequency and the suppressor activity ofCD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs and the expression of FOXP3 transcripts and protein havebeen reported to be significantly impaired in AAA patients vs normal donors.

AB  - Viral infectious diseases have various neurological manifestations, whether they are epidemic or pandemic in nature. Nonspecific encephalopathy is the most commoncentral nervous system (CNS) manifestation. The spectrum of nervous evidencevaries for viral pathogens. Some infectious viruses, such as the Ebola virus,exhibit direct neurotropism. Others, such as the Rift Valley fever virus, havethe potential for neurotropism. Direct neurotropism is unknown in monkeypoxvirus, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and even smallpox. As seen in the COVID-19, theremay be evidence of para-infectious neurological syndrome. There have only been a few reports of neurological diseases caused by monkeypox infection. Futureefforts to prevent the spread of infectious disease surges can reduce mortalitycomplications, the therapeutic burden on the health-care system, and preventfurther spread. This study describes the clinical and neurological complications of monkeypox infection, particularly encephalitis, as well as the laboratorydiagnosis of these cases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Co-infection of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with otherbacteria is associated with increased frequency of hospitalization and reducedquality of life. However, the clinical significance of co-infection with NTM and other bacteria remains unclear. Here, we investigated the distribution ofalveolar macrophage populations, characterized their phagocytic function inbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and assessed the bactericidal function ofmacrophages infected with NTM using cell lines. METHODS: BALF samples wereprospectively obtained from 30 patients with suspected NTM lung disease toevaluate phagocytic activities of macrophages using immunostaining. Bactericidal activities of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (M. intracellulare)-infected or -non-infected macrophages were evaluated usingmacrophage cell lines. RESULTS: Eleven patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection and 19 patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infectionsexcept for NTM infection (controls) were enrolled. The percentage ofnon-polarized (HLA-DR(+), CD40(-), and CD163(-)) macrophages in patients infectedwith MAC was significantly higher than that in controls; non-polarizedmacrophages demonstrated an impaired ability to phagocytose S. aureus. In vitroexperiments revealed higher intracellular S. aureus colony-forming unit countsand proinflammatory cytokine levels in M. intracellulare-infected macrophagesthan in non-NTM-infected macrophages. Electron microscopy showed morphologically damaged macrophages and M. intracellulare and S. aureus growing in the samephagosome. CONCLUSION: The proportion of alveolar macrophages (HLA-DR(+),CD40(-), and CD163(-)) with impaired phagocytosis increased in MAC-infectedindividuals. M. intracellulare-infected macrophages reduced bactericidal activityin vitro. Dysfunction of alveolar macrophages may contribute to persistentinfection by other bacteria, leading to MAC lung disease progression.

AB  - In the recent decades, there has been increased interest in the study on socialinteractions of pathogenic bacteria and biofilm-forming microbes. Leptospira is azoonotic pathogen that causes human leptospirosis. Biofilm formation bypathogenic and saprophytic Leptospira has been documented in various biotic andabiotic environments. Biofilm supports cell growth and protects them from avariety of environmental stress. Pathogenic bacterial biofilm might increase the virulence and pathogenesis. However, research on the social behaviour and biofilmproduction by Leptospira is limited. This review discusses the interplay between the different species in the biofilm formation of saprophytic and pathogenicLeptospira and potential future applications.

AB  - Neurite outgrowth is an integrated whole-cell response triggered by thecannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R). We sought to identify the many differentbiochemical pathways that contribute to this whole cell response. To understandunderlying mechanisms, we identified subcellular processes composed of one ormore biochemical pathways and their interactions required for this response.Differentially expressed genes and proteins were obtained from bulktranscriptomics and proteomic analysis of extracts from cells stimulated by aCB1R agonist. We then used these differentially expressed genes and proteins tobuild networks of SCPs and their interactions by combining the expression datawith prior pathway knowledge. From these SCP networks, we identified additionalgenes that when ablated, experimentally validated the SCP involvement in neurite outgrowth. Our experiments and informatics modeling allowed us to identifydiverse SCPs such as those involved in pyrimidine metabolism, lipid biosynthesis,and mRNA splicing and stability, along with more predictable SCPs such asmembrane vesicle transport and microtubule dynamics. We find that SCPs requiredfor neurite outgrowth are widely distributed among many biochemical pathwaysrequired for constitutive cellular functions, several of which are termed 'deep',since they are distal to signaling pathways and the key SCPs directly involved inextension of the neurite. In contrast, 'proximal' SCPs are involved inmicrotubule growth and membrane vesicle transport dynamics required for neuriteoutgrowth. From these bioinformatics and dynamical models based on experimentaldata, we conclude that receptor-mediated regulation of subcellular functions for neurite outgrowth is both distributed, i.e., involves many different biochemical pathways, and deep.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are core components of innate immunity to protectinsects against microbial infections. Nuclear receptors (NRs) areligand-dependent transcription factors that can regulate the expression of genes critical for insect development including molting and metamorphosis. However, therole of NRs in host innate immune response to microbial infection remains poorly understood in Tribolium castaneum (T. castaneum). Here, we show thatestrogen-related receptor (ERR), an insect ortholog of the mammalian ERR familyof NRs, is a novel transcriptional regulator of AMP genes for innate immuneresponse of T. castaneum. Tribolium ERR (TcERR) expression was induced by immune deficiency (IMD)-Relish signaling in response to infection by Escherichia coli(E. coli), a Gram-negative bacterium, as demonstrated in TcIMD-deficient beetles.Interestingly, genome-wide transcriptome analysis of TcERR-deficient old larvaeusing RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TcERR expression was positivelycorrelated with gene transcription levels of AMPs including attacins, defensins, and coleoptericin. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed thatTcERR could directly bind to ERR-response elements on promoters of genes encodingdefensin3 and coleoptericin, critical for innate immune response of T. castaneum.Finally, TcERR-deficient old larvae infected with E. coli displayed enhancedbacterial load and significantly less host survival. These findings suggest that TcERR can coordinate transcriptional regulation of AMPs and host innate immuneresponse to bacterial infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based intraoperative infection control measures can reduceStaphylococcus aureus transmission and infections. We aimed to determine whether transmitted S. aureus isolates were associated with increased risk of multidrugresistance and associated traits. METHODS: S. aureus isolates obtained fromintraoperative environmental, patient skin, and provider hand reservoirs among274 operating room case pairs (1(st) and 2(nd) case of the day) across 3 majoracademic medical centers from March 2009 to February 2010 underwentsystematic-phenotypic-genomic analysis to identify clonal transmission events.The association of clonal S. aureus transmission with multidrug resistance andresistance traits was investigated. Transmission dynamics were characterized.RESULTS: Transmitted isolates (N=58) were associated with increased risk ofmulti-drug antibiotic resistance [33% (19/58) transmitted vs. 10% (12/115) other isolates, risk ratio 3.14, 99% CI 1.34-7.38, P=0.0006]. Transmission wasassociated with a significant increase in resistance traits including mecA [40%transmitted isolates vs. 17% other isolates, risk ratio 2.28, P=0.0026] and ant(6)-Ia [26% transmitted isolates vs. 9% other isolates, risk ratio 2.97,P=0.0050]. Provider hands were a frequent reservoir of origin, between-case acommon mode of transmission, and patient skin and provider hands frequenttransmission locations for multidrug resistant pathogens. CONCLUSIONS:Intraoperative S. aureus transmission was associated with multidrug resistanceand resistance traits. Proven infection control measures should be leveraged totarget intraoperative transmission of multidrug resistant pathogens.

AB  - Biomembranes constitute the first lines of defense of cells. While smallmolecules can often permeate cell walls in bacteria and plants, they aregenerally unable to penetrate the barrier constituted by the double layer ofphospholipids, unless specific receptors or channels are present. Antimicrobialor cell-penetrating peptides are in fact highly specialized molecules able tobypass this barrier and even discriminate among different cell types. Thiscapacity is made possible by the intrinsic properties of its phospholipids, theirdistribution between the internal and external leaflet, and their ability tomutually interact, modulating the membrane fluidity and the exposition of keyheadgroups. Although common phospholipids can be found in the membranes of mostorganisms, some are characteristic of specific cell types. Here, we review theproperties of the most common lipids and describe how they interact with eachother in biomembrane. We then discuss how their assembly in bilayers determinessome key physical-chemical properties such as permeability, potential and phasestatus. Finally, we describe how the exposition of specific phospholipidsdetermines the recognition of cell types by membrane-targeting molecules.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 technology has emerged as a promising tool for genetic engineering ofStreptomyces strains. However, in practice, numerous technical hurdles have yetto be overcome when developing robust editing procedures. Here, we developed anextension of the CRISPR-Cas toolbox, a simple and reliable cas9 monitoring toolwith transcriptional fusion of cas9 nuclease to a beta glucuronidase (gusA)visual reporter gene. The Cas9-SD-GusA tool enables in situ identification ofcells expressing Cas9 nuclease following the introduction of the plasmid carryingthe CRISPR-Cas9 machinery. Remarkably, when the Cas9-SD-GusA system was appliedunder optimal conditions, 100% of the colonies displaying GusA activity carriedthe target genotype. In contrast, it was shown that the cas9 sequence hadundergone major recombination events in the colonies that did not exhibit GusAactivity, giving rise to "escaper colonies" carrying unedited genotype. Ourapproach allows a simple detection of "escaper" phenotype and serves as anefficient CRISPR-Cas9 optimisation tool.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) following hip and knee arthroplastyposes serious health and economic burden. AIM: To evaluate SSI managementstrategies and outcomes to help address this problem. METHODS: We performed aretrospective cohort study of adults undergoing primary total hip or kneearthroplasty who were identified to have a complex SSI by infection preventionand control surveillance audit. Audits identified SSI within 90 days ofarthroplasty. Patients at two tertiary referral centres in Edmonton, Alberta,Canada from 2012 to 2019 were included and SSI cases were followed for two years.FINDINGS: We identified 240 SSIs and found that 202 (84%) were managed withdebridement with antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR), of which 71% achieved cure. The use of any topical intra-operative antibiotic in DAIR was notassociated with improved outcome (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 0.91 - 3.10, p-value =0.097). DAIR performed at 31-90 days from arthroplasty had lower chance of curecompared to DAIR performed within 30 days, however this was not statisticallysignificant (60 vs 73%, p-value = 0.123). Initial treatment failures requiringadditional surgery had 51% cure. The majority (78%) of treatment failuresinitially managed with DAIR ultimately required two-stage revision. CONCLUSIONS: We provide insight from a population-based perspective on the surgical managementof SSIs after primary total hip and knee arthroplasty in a large cohort.Additionally, we follow SSIs that had initial management failure. This data caninform future studies such as the economic burden associated with theseinfections, and plan interventions to optimize SSI management.

AB  - In currently, biosynthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are mostwidely used numerous in biological applications such as biosensor, energy,medicine, agriculture, environmental and industrial wastewater treatment. Thehierarchical CuO NPs was synthesized via green chemistry method by using ofAbutilon indicum (A. indicum) leaf extract, its nontoxic, facile and low-costapproaches. Biogenic synthesized CuO NPs was characterized by using a UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field mission scanning electron microscopy(FE-SEM) with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. Thesynthesized CuO NPs was performed antibacterial activity against human pathogenicorganisms of both Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi) and Gram positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria by using agarwell diffusion method. Biological synthesized CuO NPs was showed potentialbactericidal activity against Gram positive bacteria of B. subtilis than comparedto Gram negative bacteria of E. coli. The cytotoxic effect of A. indicum mediatedsynthesized CuO NPs was evaluated against to human lung A549 and breastMDA-MB-231cancer cell lines by determined using of MTT assay. In furthermore,photocatalytic dye degradation was performed that synthesized CuO NPs haveeffectively removed 78% of malachite green dye molecule. Our investigationresults suggested that the green synthesized CuO NPs potential biologicalactivity of antibacterial activity against Gram positive bacterial, anticanceractivity was effectively against MDA-MB-231cancer cell line and best dyedegradation was exhibited in malachite green. The A. indicum aqueous leaf extractmediated synthesized CuO NPs has strongly suggested promising nano-biomaterialsfor fabrication of biomedical applications.

AB  - Intercropping of arsenic (As) hyperaccumulator (Pteris vittata L.) with crops canreduce the As concentration in soil and the resulting ecological and healthrisks, while maintaining certain economic benefits. However, it is still unclear how As-transforming functional bacteria and dominant bacteria in the rhizosphere of P. vittata affect the microbial properties of crop rhizosphere soil, as wellas how As concentration and speciation change in crop rhizosphere soil underintercropping. This is of great significance for understanding the biogeochemicalcycle of As in soil and crops. This study aimed to use high-throughput sequencingand quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to analyze the effects ofdifferent rhizosphere isolation patterns on the bacterial diversity and the copy number of As-transforming functional genes in pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)rhizosphere soil. The results showed that the abundance of bacteria in therhizosphere soil of pomegranate increased by 16.3%, and the soil bacterialcommunity structure significantly changed. C_Alphaproteobacteria ando_Rhizobiales bacteria significantly accumulated in the rhizosphere ofpomegranate. The copy number of As methylation (arsM) gene in pomegranaterhizosphere soil significantly increased by 63.37%. The concentrations ofnonspecifically sorbed As (F1), As associated with amorphous Fe (hydr)oxides(F3), and the total As (FT) decreased; the proportion of As (III) in pomegranate rhizosphere soil decreased; and the proportion of As (V) increased in pomegranaterhizosphere soil. c_Alphaproteobacteria and o_Rhizobiales accumulated in croprhizosphere soil under the intercropping of P. vittata with crops. Also, the copynumber of As methylation functional genes in crop rhizosphere soil significantly increased, which could reduce As (III) proportion in crop rhizosphere soil. Thesechanges favored simultaneous agricultural production and soil remediation. Theresults provided the theoretical basis and practical guidance for the safeutilization of As-contaminated soil in the intercropping of As-hyperaccumulatorand cash crops.

AB  - The remnants of historical industrial contamination can be detected in manyaquatic ecosystems worldwide even at present time. Mreznica is a river in Croatiathat has been, for more than a hundred years, continually exposed to effluents ofvarious industries, which have, in modern time, mostly ceased to operate. Our aimwas to establish the level of current contamination and pollution of the Mreznicariver-water and sediments. The study of river contamination at three sites(reference site; site nearby former cotton industry facility in Duga Resa - DRF; industrial zone of Karlovac town - KIZ) in three sampling campaigns (May 2020,April and September 2021) encompassed analyses of physico-chemical waterparameters, screening of 369 pesticides, measurement of metal (loid)concentrations in the sediments, and in the dissolved and particulate phases ofthe river-water. The sediment pollution was assessed through the analyses oftotal bacteria abundance (by targeting 16S rRNA genes), and their associatedmetal resistance genes (cnrA, pbrT and czcD) and class 1 integrons (intl1). Atthe DRF site, industrial organic contaminants that can be traced to textileproduction were detected (dye and nylon components), as well as increased levels of some metals bound to suspended particulate matter and sediments. At the mostdownstream KIZ site, occasional high level of industrial herbicide neburon wasmeasured in the river-water, and metal contamination of suspended particulatematter and sediments was evident. Although, based on the comparison withlegislation and literature data, the level of contamination was rather mild, the effects on microbial communities were unquestionable, confirmed by increasedabundance of the czcD gene at DRF site and the intI1 gene at both industriallyimpacted sites. Obtained results indicated long-term sediment retention of someindustrial contaminants at the places of historical freshwater contamination,and, thus, the necessity for their monitoring even after the termination ofcontamination sources.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) provide habitats to microorganisms in aquatic environments;distinct microbial niches have recently been elucidated. However, there is littleknown about the microbial communities on MPs under urban riverine conditions, in which environmental factors fluctuate. Therefore, this study investigated MPbiofilm communities under various urban riverine conditions (i.e., organiccontent, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration) and evaluated theprioritized factors affecting plastisphere communities. Nine biofilm-formingreactors were operated under various environmental factors. Under all testingconditions, biofilms grew on MPs with decreasing bacterial diversity.Interestingly, biofilm morphology and bacterial populations were driven by theenvironmental parameters. We found that plastisphere community structures weregrouped according to the environmental conditions; organic content in the waterwas the most significant factor determining MP biofilm communities, followed bysalinity and DO concentration. The principal plastisphere communities wereProteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes phyla. In-depthanalyses of plastisphere communities revealed that biofilm-forming andplastic-degrading bacteria were the predominant microbes. In addition, potential pathogens were majorly discovered in the riverine waters with high organiccontent. Our results suggest that distinct plastisphere communities coexist with MP particles under certain riverine water conditions, implying that the varied MPbiofilm communities may affect urban riverine ecology in a variety of ways.

AB  - Airborne microbe can have impact on regional to global climate as ice nuclei and cloud condensation nuclei. In coastal region, microbial aerosols aresimultaneously contributed by terrestrial and marine sources under the influence of land-sea air exchange. We present a study on the characteristics of airbornebacteria and fungi, including their concentrations and communities, at a land-seatransition site in Southern China from December 2019 to December 2020. Seasonalvariations of microbial communities were observed with evident profiles insummer, especially for fungal aerosols. The significant enhancement ofBasidiomycota abundance in summer was contributed by local biogenic release underthe influence of meteorological factors. Terrestrial sources are suggested as thedominant contributors to both bacterial and fungal aerosols rather than marinesources during the whole year period. Source-tracking analysis identified thatmarine contributions to airborne bacteria and fungi were 3.1-14.2% and 4-24%,respectively. It suggests that airborne fungi should be more suitable forlong-range transport than airborne bacteria. This study improves theunderstanding of the conversional contribution of marine and terrestrial sources to airborne microbes in coastal region and the influencing environmental factors under land-sea exchange.

AB  - This study investigated the impacts of lime addition and further microbialinoculum on gaseous emission and humification during kitchen waste composting.High-throughput sequencing was integrated with Linear Discriminant AnalysisEffect Size (LEfSe) and Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) todecipher bacterial dynamics in response to different additives. Results showedthat lime addition enriched bacteria, such as Taibaiella and Sphingobacterium as biomarkers, to strengthen organic biodegradation toward humification.Furthermore, lime addition facilitated the proliferation of thermophilic bacteria(e.g. Bacillus and Symbiobacterium) for aerobic chemoheterotrophy, leading toenhanced organic decomposition to trigger notable gaseous emission. Such emissionprofile was further exacerbated by microbial inoculum to lime-regulated conditiongiven the rapid enrichment of bacteria (e.g. Caldicoprobacter and Pusillimonas asbiomarkers) for fermentation and denitrification. In addition, microbial inoculumslightly hindered humus formation by narrowing the relative abundance of bacteriafor humification. Results from this study show that microbial inoculum tofeedstock should be carefully regulated to accelerate composting and avoidexcessive gaseous emission.

AB  - AIMS: Several studies have linked gut microbes to human diseases. Most of themechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria have beneficial effects on the humanbody are related to immune modulation. Controlled studies of the ability oflactic acid bacteria to absorb phosphorus directly from the intestine and therebycontrol serum phosphorus level in in vivo uremic animal models are limited.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened lactic acid bacteria living in Koreanfermented foods to identify those that absorb the most phosphorus and notedLactiplantibacillus paraplantarum KCCM 11826P. The mechanism through which betterintracellular absorption of phosphorus occurs in this strain was studied usinggenomic DNA sequencing. After the strain was administered to 5/6 nephrectomizedrats for 6weeks, it was observed whether hyperphosphatemia had improved. KEYFINDINGS: The L. paraplantarum KCCM 11826P strain has a polyP gene cluster; thus,it absorbs phosphorus better than other bacteria and can suppress strains thatproduce indole. Supplementing the diets of 5/6 nephrectomized rats with this L.paraplantarum strain significantly decreased serum phosphate level (by 22%) andreduced blood indoxyl sulphate concentration (by 40%) compared with vehicletreatment. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that Lactiplantibacilluspreparations can be used for multiple purposes, such as the removal of phosphorusand uremic toxins from patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This studyalso demonstrates the novel concept of a probiotic phosphate binder.

AB  - Soils are the final sink for multiple organic pollutants emitted to theenvironment. Some of these chemicals which are toxic, recalcitrant and canbioaccumulate in living organism and biomagnify in trophic chains are classified persistent organic pollutants (POP). Vast areas of arable land have been pollutedby POPs and the only economically possible means of decontamination isbioremediation, that is the utilization of POP-degrading microbes. Especiallyuseful can be non-ligninolytic fungi, as their fast-growing mycelia can reach POPmolecules strongly bond to soil minerals or humus fraction inaccessible tobacteria. The mobilized POP molecules are incorporated into the fungal plasmamembrane where their degradation begins. The presence of POP molecules in themembranes can change their physical properties and trigger toxic effects to thecell. To avoid these phenomena fungi can quickly remodel the phospholipidcomposition of their membrane with employing different phospholipases andacyltransferases. However, if the presence of POP downregulates thephospholipases, toxic effects and the final death of microbial cells are highlyprobable. In our studies we applied multicomponent Langmuir monolayers with theircomposition mimicking fungal plasma membranes and studied their interactions withtwo different microbial phospholipases: phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) andphospholipase A1 (Lecitase ultra). The model membranes were doped with selectedPOPs that are frequently found in contaminated soils. It turned out that most of the employed POPs do not downregulate considerably the activity ofphospholipases, which is a good prognostics for the application ofnon-ligninolytic fungi in bioremediation.

AB  - Total nitrogen (TN) removal from municipal wastewater after organic recovery ischallenging because of the low ratio of chemical oxygen demand (COD) to TN.Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) is promising because it has no organicrequirement, but its performance in treating effluents following COD capturedremains unclear. This study used mainstream partial Anammox to remove nitrogenfrom effluent following magnetic separation within a continuous-flow anoxic-oxic reactor. Compared with traditional nitrification and denitrification, partialAnammox increased TN removal efficiency by 15.0% and contributed 23.6% of TNremoval. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that the copy number of the Anammox gene (hzsB) increased substantially, while those of the nitriteoxidation (nxrA) and denitrification (narG and nirS) genes decreased.High-throughput sequencing identified Candidatus Brocadia as the dominant genusof anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria. These findings demonstrate theeffectiveness of mainstream partial Anammox for treating COD-captured effluentsand its potential in municipal wastewater treatment.

AB  - An eco-friendly strategy for mariculture wastewater treatment using an electricfield attached membrane bioreactor (E-MBR) was evaluated and compared with aconventional membrane bioreactor (C-MBR). The removal efficiencies of totalnitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) increased significantly and themembrane fouling rate reduced by 44.8% in the E-MBR. The underlying mechanismsincluded the enriched nitrifiers and denitrifiers, the enhancedsalinity-resistance, the increased activities and upregulated genes of keyenzymes involved in nitrification and denitrification for improving theperformance of mariculture wastewater treatment, and the enriched extracellularpolymeric substance (EPS)-degrading genera, the downregulated EPS biosynthesisgenes, the repressed biofilm-forming bacteria, the enhanced zeta potentialabsolute value and the generated H2O2 for membrane fouling mitigation byelectrical stimulation. Compared with the C-MBR, the energy consumption, carbonemissions, and nitrogen footprint were reduced. These findings provide novelinsights into mariculture wastewater treatment using an applied electric field.

AB  - Currently, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) with their widespread applications lead to their increasing dosages in wastewater, posing an urgent threat towastewater treatment. Herein, the responses of the emerging microalgal-bacterial granular sludge (MBGS) to ZnO-NPs were investigated. The results showed that the performance of MBGS was significantly affected when the concentration of ZnO-NPs reached 10 mg/L, especially for the removal of ammonia and phosphorus. ZnO-NPs onthe granular surface could affect microalgae photosynthesis by shading, whileantioxidant enzymes could be generated against overproduced reactive oxygenspecies. Specifically, ZnO-NPs addition to MBGS systems altered the microbialcommunity structure (e.g. Cyanobacteria) and function (e.g. biosynthesis) ofprokaryotes rather than eukaryotes. Overall, the MBGS could exhibit multiplemechanisms to alleviate the ZnO-NPs toxicity. This study is expected to addknowledge on MBGS in the treatment of wastewater containing nanoparticles.

AB  - The bioaugmentation potential of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) was investigatedusing heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification (HN-AD) bacterialconsortium to improve nitrogen removal during petroleum wastewater treatment. An efficient HN-AD consortium was constructed by mixing Pseudomonas mendocina K0,Brucella sp. K1, Pseudomonas putida T4 and Paracoccus sp. T9. AGS bioaugmented byimmobilized HN-AD consortium enhanced nitrogen removal, which showed NH4(+)-N andTN removal efficiency of 92.4% and 79.8%, respectively. The immobilizedconsortium addition facilitated larger AGS formation, while granules > 2.0 mmaccounted for 16.7% higher than that of control (6.7%). Further, the abundance ofnapA gene was 4-times higher in the bioaugmented AGS as compared to the control, which demonstrated the long-term stability of HN-AD consortium in the bioreactor.The bioaugmented AGS also showed a higher abundance of xenobiotics biodegradationand nitrogen metabolism. These results highlight that bioaugmentation of AGStechnology could be effectively used for enhanced denitrification of petroleumwastewater.

AB  - Heterologous vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides arational strategy to rapidly increase vaccination coverage in many regions of theworld. Although data regarding messenger RNA (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 vaccinecombinations are available, there is limited information about the combination ofthese platforms with other vaccines widely used in developing countries, such as BBIBP-CorV and Sputnik V. Here, we assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicityof 15 vaccine combinations in 1,314 participants. We evaluate immunoglobulin G(IgG) anti-spike response and virus neutralizing titers and observe that a numberof heterologous vaccine combinations are equivalent or superior to homologousschemes. For all cohorts in this study, the highest antibody response is induced by mRNA-1273 as the second dose. No serious adverse events are detected in any ofthe schedules analyzed. Our observations provide rational support for the use of different vaccine combinations to achieve wide vaccine coverage in the shortestpossible time.

The soft robots were fabricated as tapered,hollow rod-like soft scaffolds by applying a robust and economic moldingtechnique to a polyacrylamide-based hydrogel polymer. Cylindrical micro-magnetswere embedded in both ends of the soft scaffolds, which allowed bending(deformation) and actuation under a uniform rotating magnetic field. Wedemonstrated that the tapered rod-like soft robot in viscous Newtonian fluidscould perform two types of propulsion; boundary rolling was displayed when thesoft robot was located near a boundary, and swimming was displayed far away from the boundary. In addition, we performed numerical simulations to understand theswimming propulsion along the rotating axis and the way in which this propulsion is affected by the soft robot's design, rotation frequency, and fluid viscosity. Our results suggested that a simple geometrical asymmetry would enable therod-like soft robot to perform propulsion in the low Reynolds number (Re<< 1)regime; these promising results provide essential insights into the improvements that must be made to integrate the soft robots into minimally invasiveinvivoapplications.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an important micronutrient that is not readily available topathogens during infection. Hosts resist the invasion of pathogens throughnutritional immunity and oxidative stress. To overcome this nutrient restriction,bacteria utilize high affinity transporters to compete with nutrient-bindingproteins (e.g., calprotectin). Little is known about the role of Mn in thepathophysiology of Streptococcus suis. Here, we revealed that the tolerance of S.suis to calprotectin and oxidative stress was associated with Mn. Inactivation ofMn uptake system, TroABCD, in S. suis decreased the tolerance to calprotectin andoxidative stress. Furthermore, Mn uptake system mutant strains reduced capacityfor bacterial cellular survival, and attenuated virulence in a mouse model. Toexplore the regulatory mechanism, we determined the transcriptional start site oftroABCD using capping rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Furthermore, we revealed that TroR was a transcriptional regulatory repressor of troABCD. In the absenceof troR, transcription levels of troA, troB, troC, and troD were not inhibited bylow or high Mn levels, and intracellular Mn contents of mutant strains werehigher than that of the wild-type strain. Finally, we used electrophoreticmobility shift assay to demonstrate that TroR bound the promoter region oftroABCD. Collectively, this study revealed that Mn acquisition was essential for pathogenesis of S. suis and Mn uptake systems should be targets for thedevelopment of new antimicrobials.

AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most common form of RNA modification, controls CD4(+) T cell homeostasis by targeting the IL-7/STAT5/SOCS signaling pathways.The role of m(6)A modification in unconventional T cell development remainsunknown. Using mice with T cell-specific deletion of RNA methyltransferaseMETTL14 (T-Mettl14(-/-)), we demonstrate that m(6)A modification is indispensablefor iNKT cell homeostasis. Loss of METTL14-dependent m(6)A modification leads to the upregulation of apoptosis in double-positive thymocytes, which in turndecreases Valpha14-Jalpha18 gene rearrangements, resulting in drastic reductionof iNKT numbers in the thymus and periphery. Residual T-Mettl14(-/-) iNKT cellsexhibit increased apoptosis, impaired maturation, and decreased responsiveness toIL-2/IL-15 and TCR stimulation. Furthermore, METTL14 knockdown in mature iNKTcells diminishes their cytokine production, correlating with increased Cishexpression and decreased TCR signaling. Collectively, our study highlights acritical role for METTL14-dependent-m(6)A modification in iNKT cell developmentand function.

AB  - Antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in sewage sludge can causehigh ecotoxicological risks in the environment and public health concerns. Theaims of this study were to establish enzymatic integrated in-situ advancedanaerobic digestion (AAD) by adding cellulase and papain as well as the twoenzymes combined with zero valent iron (ZVI) directly into the anaerobicdigesters to explore the removal of antibiotics and ARGs under the mesophiliccondition (35 degrees C). The methane production potential during in-situ AAD waseffectively improved. Papain and cellulase at 30 mg/gTSS were most effective inimproving antibiotic removal. The removal of sulfamerazine (SMZ) and sulfadiazine(SMR) could reach 89.10 % and 71.75 %. Combined enzymes with ZVI also enhancedthe removal of all target antibiotics, especially roxithromycin (ROX), SMZ andSMR most significantly. Except for sul1, tetA and tetB, the removal of ARGs bypapain reached 6.33 %-82.15 %. The addition of cellulase effectively improvedtetA removal. The combination of biological enzymes further enhanced the removal of qnrS and ermX. The tetG, tetB, sul3, ermX, ermT, qnrS, and aac(6')-IB-CR bycombined enzymes with ZVI could even not be detected after digestion. Addition ofpapain, cellulase, and ZVI caused variations in the dominant bacteria. All targetantibiotics presented significant positive correlations with the generanorank_f__Bacteroidetes_vadinHA17, norank_f__norank_o__SJA-15,norank_f__norank_o__Aminicenantales. Redundancy analysis showed archaeaMethanosaeta and Candidatus_ Methanoacidiosum genera greatly contributed toantibiotics removal with the combination of enzymes and ZVI. Co-occurrencenetwork analysis indicated the removal of ARGs was mainly based on the changes ofexistence of host bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A review of the literature shows there is a dearth of community-basedstudies that evaluated the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its psychosocial correlates among Nigerians. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its psychosocial correlates in a Nigerian community.METHODS: The data presented here is an extract from the IlisanRemo FunctionalBowel Disorder Project, a cross-sectional community-based study of 515 adultsaged 18-70 years. The aspects of the research instrument relevant to this studyinclude the sociodemographic data, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), BeckAnxiety and Depression Inventories, and Short Form 12, version 2 Health Survey(SF-12v2) questionnaire. An overall PSQI score of >5 was defined as poor sleepquality. Data analysis was conducted with appropriate statistical instruments.P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There were adequate data for statistical analysis for 505 participants. The participants' mean age was32.73+/-12.93 years. A total of 212 (42.0%) participants had poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was associated with attainment of at least secondaryschooleducation [AOR = 2.27 (95% CI, 1.17 - 4.41), p = 0.016], increased waistcircumference [AOR = 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01 - 1.04), p < 0.001], coffee consumption[AOR = 2.57 (95% CI, 1.66 - 3.99), p < 0.001], anxiety [AOR = 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03 - 1.09), p < 0.001], and depression [AOR = 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03 - 1.08), p <0.001]. Participants with poor sleep quality had poorer mean SF-12v2 sub-scalesscores compared with those with good sleep quality in Bodily Pain, GeneralHealth, Vitality and Mental Health with statistical significance (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality is common in our study population and needs to be holistically addressed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: As a susceptibility gene for human inflammatory bowel diseases(IBD), how avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog-1 (ETS-1) modulates intestinal mucosal immune response remains unclear. Here we studied the potentialroles of ETS-1 in the pathogenesis of IBD. METHODS: ETS-1 expression was examinedin IBD patients. CD45RB(high)CD4(+) T cell-transfer colitis, dextran sulfatesodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and azomethane (AOM)/DSS-induced colitis-associatedcancer (CAC) models were constructed to probe the function of ETS-1 in vivo.RNA-sequencing of CD4(+) T cells from Ets-1 transgenic (Tg) mice was performed todecipher the key differentially expressed genes. Adenovirus transduction wasconducted to verify the therapeutic potentials of ETS-1 in vivo. RESULTS: ETS-1expression was significantly increased in CD4(+) T cells from active IBD patientscompared with healthy controls, which was upregulated by TNF-alpha but markedlysuppressed by anti-TNF-alpha mAb therapy. More severe colitis was observed inRag1(-/-) mice reconstituted with Ets-1(Tg)CD45RB(high)CD4(+) T cells or in Ets-1Tg mice after DSS exposure compared with controls, characterized by higherTNF-alpha and IFN-gamma expression in inflamed colon. Ets-1 Tg mice were moreprone to develop AOM/DSS-induced CAC, and bone marrow chimeras further provedthat lamina propria immune cells but not intestinal epithelial cells contributed to the development of colitis. RNA-sequencing and luciferase analysis revealedcold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) as a functional target of ETS-1 topromote Th1 cell-driven immune response. Consistently, intraperitonealadministration of adenovirus-m-cirbp-shRNA ameliorated trinitrobenzene sulfonicacid (TNBS)-induced colitis of Ets-1 Tg mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify thatETS-1 is highly expressed in IBD patients and promotes Th1-driven mucosalinflammation through CIRBP. CIRBP may serve as a novel therapeutic target fortreatment of human IBD.

AB  - Recently, developing countries have focused on using innovative feed in poultrynutrition. The plant Moringa oleifera is native to India but grows worldwide intropical and subtropical climates. Moringa is planted on a large scale as it can tolerate severe dry and cold conditions. All parts of this plant can be used for commercial or nutritional purposes, and it has a favorable nutritional profile.Beneficial phytochemicals, minerals, and vitamins are abundant in the leaves. Theleaf extracts can be used to treat malnutrition; they also possess anticancer,antioxidant, antidiabetic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties.Further, moringa contains antinutritional substances, such as trypsin inhibitors,phytates, tannins, oxalates, cyanide, and saponins, which have a harmful effecton mineral and protein metabolism. Previous research suggested that includingmoringa in chicken diets boosts their growth and productivity. Therefore, thisreview focuses on the characterization and application of M. oleifera in poultry nutrition and its potential toxicity. Furthermore, we discuss the nutritionalcontent, phytochemicals, and antioxidants of M. oleifera leaf meal and itsapplicability in poultry rations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising therapy, but it has not been used to treat neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) due toreports of adverse side effects. Probiotics are considered relatively safe withpracticable administrative procedures; however, no systematic research hascompared the results of FMT and probiotic consortium transplantation (PCT) onoxidative stress in the intestines of patients with NEC. We conducted this study to provide a basis for optimizing NEC therapy. METHODS: Eight-day-old newbornC57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the following four groups: the dam-fedgroup (control group); the NEC induction group (NEC group); the NEC induction andtransplantation of Lactobacillus reuteri and Bifidobacterium infantis consortium group (NEC + PCT group); and the NEC induction and the FMT group (NEC + FMT).Intestinal injury, oxidative stress indexes, intestinal barrier function, andinflammatory cytokines were assessed in the terminal ileum. RESULTS: FMT moreeffectively modulates oxidative stress in the intestine than does PCT; however,the difference between the effects of PCT and FMT was not significant. Theprotective effect was associated with enhanced antioxidant capacity, regulationof the main components of the mucus layer, reduced inflammatory reactions, andimproved intestinal integrity. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal dysbiosis affectsoxidative stress, inflammatory response, and mucosal integrity. Although FMT ismore effective than PCT in regulating oxidative stress, PCT may be preferred inpediatrics because the proportion and dose of transplanted bacteria can bestandardized and individualized according to individual conditions.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with the ability to thwart clinical therapies and escalate mortality rates is emerging as one of the most pressing global healthand environmental concerns. Urban rivers as an important subsystem of theenvironment offer galore of ecological services which benefit the city dwellers. However, with increased urbanization, industrialization, and heavy discharge ofanthropogenic waste harboring antibiotics, heavy metals, pesticides, antibioticresistance genes (ARGs), antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), urban rivers arebecoming major reservoirs of ARGs and a hotspot for accelerated selection of ARB.These ARGs in urban rivers have the potential of being transferred to clinically important pathogens. In addition, urban rivers also act as important vectors for AMR spread. This is mainly due to the direct exposure of humans and animals tothe heavily contaminated river water and high mobility of organisms (aquaticanimals, pathogenic, non-pathogenic bacteria) as well as the genetic elementsincluding ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the river. However, in spiteof recent advocacy for comprehensive research programs aimed to investigate theoccurrence, extent and major drivers of AMR in urban rivers globally, suchstudies are missing largely. This review encompasses the issues of AMR, majordrivers and their vital roles in the evolution and spread of ARB with an emphasison sources and hotspots of diverse ARGs in urban rivers contributing toco-occurrence of ARGs and MGEs. Further, the causal factors leading to adverseeffects of antibiotic-load to river organisms with an elaboration on the current measures to eradicate the ARB, ARGs, and remove antibiotics from the urban river ecosystems are also discussed. A perspective review of current and emergingstrategies with potentials of combating AMR in urban river ecosystems includingadvanced water treatment methodologies and floating islands or constructedwetlands.

TI  - Spatial Variability of Bacterial Community Compositions in the Mariana Trench.
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2022-0040 [doi]
AB  - Hadal microorganisms play an important role in the biogeochemical processes inmarine ecosystems and act as a valuable resource for industrial applications.This paper presents the bacterial community analysis of samples taken from theChallenger Deep within the Mariana Trench, which is the deepest site in theocean. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to reveal that the vertically sampled bacterial populations at eight stations varied at thesurface to 10 km depth. The surface water samples harbored a distinct bacterialassemblage, while the mesopelagic and bathyal samples manifested differentbacterial community composition, which was not consistent with previous studies. Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacteria in the bathyal and hadalwater. The hadal bacterial community consisted mostly of Alteromonadales andOceanospirillales. The former was widely spread in the water column, which might suggest habitat partitioning at the genus and OTU levels, while the latter might represent hadal-enriched hydrocarbon degraders. The present work complements the current knowledge and understanding of the bathyal and hadal bacterialcommunities of the Mariana Trench.

TI  - Ultraporous Polyquaternium-Carboxylated Chitosan Composite Hydrogel Spheres with Anticoagulant, Antibacterial, and Rapid Endotoxin Removal Profiles for SepsisTreatment.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00583 [doi]
AB  - Hemoperfusion is an important method to remove endotoxins and save the lives ofpatients with sepsis. However, the current adsorbents for hemoperfusion havedisadvantages of insufficient endotoxin adsorption capacity, poor bloodcompatibility, and so on. Herein, we proposed a novel emulsion templating (ET)method to prepare ultraporous and double-network carboxylated chitosan(CCS)-poly(diallyl dimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) hydrogel spheres (ET-CCSPD),bearing both negative and positive charges. CCS was introduced to balance thestrong positive charges of PDDA to improve hemocompatibility, and emulsiontemplates endowed the adsorbent with an ultraporous structure for enhancedadsorption efficacy. The ET-CCSPDs neither damaged blood cells nor activatedcomplement responses. In addition, the activated partial thromboplastin time(APTT) was prolonged to 8.5 times, which was beneficial for reducing theinjection of anticoagulant in patients. The ET-CCSPDs had excellent scavengingperformance against bacteria and endotoxin, with removal ratios of 96.7% for E.coli and 99.8% for S. aureus, respectively, and the static removal ratio ofendotoxin in plasma was as high as 99.1% (C0 = 5.50 EU/mL, critical illnesslevel). An adsorption cartridge filled with the ET-CCSPDs could remove 84.7% ofendotoxin within 1 h (C0 = 100 EU/mL in PBS). Interestingly, the ET-CCSPDs had a good inhibitory effect on the cytokines produced by endotoxin-mediated septicblood. By developing the ET method to prepare ultraporous and double-networkadsorbents, the problems of low adsorption efficiency and poor bloodcompatibility of traditional endotoxin adsorbents have been solved, thus opening a new route to fabricate absorbents for blood purification.

TI  - Methods of Preparing Nanoscale Vitreous Ice Needles for High-Resolution CryogenicCharacterization.
LID - 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c01495 [doi]
AB  - New high-resolution imaging methods for biological samples such as atom probetomography (APT), facilitated by the invention of laser-pulsed atom probes andcryo-transfer procedures, have recently emerged. However, ensuring the vitreousstate of the fabricated aqueous needle-shaped APT samples remains a challengedespite it being crucial for characterizing biomolecules such as proteins andcellular architectures in their near-native state. Our work investigated threepotential approaches: (1) open microcapillary (OMC) method, (2) high-pressurefreezing method (HPF), and (3) graphene encapsulation method. Diffractionpatterns of the needle specimens acquired by cryo-TEM have demonstrated thevitreous state of the ice needles, although limited to the tip regions, has been achieved with the three proposed approaches. With the capability to preparevitreous ice needles from hydrated samples of up to approximately 200 mumthickness (HPF), combined use of the three approaches opens new avenues forfuture near-atomic imaging of biological cells in their near-native state.

TI  - Medical Counseling on Sexual Enrichment Aids: Women's Preferences and MedicalPractitioner Expertise.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004892 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate women's preferences and experiences regarding healthcounseling of safe sexual enrichment aid use and hygiene and current counselingbehaviors of medical practitioners on this topic. METHODS: This study used mixed methodology, leveraging quantitative data from a cross-sectional survey of 800women and semi-structured qualitative interview data from 24 women across sexual practice groups. Additionally, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 192medical practitioners to understand current counseling behaviors and attitudes.RESULTS: The majority of women (96.2%, 607/631) had never been counseled by apractitioner on safe sexual enrichment aid use and hygiene but would feelcomfortable receiving counseling on the subject under certain circumstances.Overwhelmingly, women indicated the need for a nonjudgmental practitioner. Manycited the importance of having a female practitioner and preferred one withinobstetrics and gynecology. Among medical practitioners, counseling on this topic was infrequent; 27.0% (52/192) stated that they counsel patients on safe sexualenrichment aid use and hygiene when discussing safe sex, and 21.4% (41/192)reported that this topic is included when counseling women after a sexuallytransmitted infection diagnosis. Only 7.4% (14/188) and 6.4% (12/188) hadreceived training on this topic or were aware of any professional guidelines orrecommendations, respectively. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based guidelines should bedeveloped that practitioners can use to counsel patients, ensuring that women areable to engage in sexual enrichment aid use safely.

TI  - Mercury Removal from Contaminated Water by Wood-Based Biochar Depends on Natural Organic Matter and Ionic Composition.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c01554 [doi]
AB  - Biochars can remove potentially toxic elements, such as inorganic mercury[Hg(II)] from contaminated waters. However, their performance in complex watermatrices is rarely investigated, and the combined roles of natural organic matter(NOM) and ionic composition in the removal of Hg(II) by biochar remain unclear.Here, we investigate the influence of NOM and major ions such as chloride(Cl(-)), nitrate (NO3(-)), calcium (Ca(2+)), and sodium (Na(+)) on Hg(II) removalby a wood-based biochar (SWP700). Multiple sorption sites containing sulfur (S)were located within the porous SWP700. In the absence of NOM, Hg(II) removal was driven by these sites. Ca(2+) bridging was important in enhancing removal ofnegatively charged Hg(II)-chloro complexes. In the presence of NOM, formation of soluble Hg-NOM complexes (as seen from speciation calculations), which havelimited access to biochar pores, suppressed Hg(II) removal, but Cl(-) and Ca(2+) could still facilitate it. The ability of Ca(2+) to aggregate NOM, includingHg-NOM complexes, promoted Hg(II) removal from the dissolved fraction (<0.45mum). Hg(II) removal in the presence of Cl(-) followed a stepwise mechanism.Weakly bound oxygen functional groups in NOM were outcompeted by Cl(-), formingsmaller-sized Hg(II)-chloro complexes, which could access additionalintraparticle sorption sites. Therein, Cl(-) was outcompeted by S, which finally immobilized Hg(II) in SWP700 as confirmed by extended X-ray absorption finestructure spectroscopy. We conclude that in NOM containing oxic waters, withrelatively high molar ratios of Cl(-): NOM and Ca(2+): NOM, Hg(II) removal canstill be effective with SWP700.

TI  - Expanding the tolerance of segmented Influenza A Virus genome using a balancecompensation strategy.
PG  - e1010756
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010756 [doi]
AB  - Reporter viruses provide powerful tools for both basic and applied virologystudies, however, the creation and exploitation of reporter influenza A viruses(IAVs) have been hindered by the limited tolerance of the segmented genome toexogenous modifications. Interestingly, our previous study has demonstrated theunderlying mechanism that foreign insertions reduce the replication/transcriptioncapacity of the modified segment, impairing the delicate balance among themultiple segments during IAV infection. In the present study, we developed a"balance compensation" strategy by incorporating additional compensatorymutations during initial construction of recombinant IAVs to expand the toleranceof IAV genome. As a proof of concept, promoter-enhancing mutations wereintroduced within the modified segment to rectify the segments imbalance of areporter influenza PR8-NS-Gluc virus, while directed optimization of therecombinant IAV was successfully achieved. Further, we generated recombinant IAVsexpressing a much larger firefly luciferase (Fluc) by coupling with a muchstronger compensatory enhancement, and established robust Fluc-based live-imagingmouse models of IAV infection. Our strategy feasibly expands the tolerance forforeign gene insertions in the segmented IAV genome, which opens up betteropportunities to develop more versatile reporter IAVs as well as live attenuated influenza virus-based vaccines for other important human pathogens.

AB  - The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, such as the Omicron variants which arehighly transmissible and immune evasive, underscores the need to developtherapeutic antibodies with broad neutralizing activities. Here, we used theLIBRA-seq technology, which identified SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells viaDNA-barcoding and subsequently single cell sequenced BCRs, to identify anantibody, SW186, which could neutralize major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,including Beta, Delta, and Omicron, as well as SARS-CoV-1. The cryo-EM structure of SW186 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike proteinshowed that SW186 interacted with an epitope of the RBD that is not at theinterface of its binding to the ACE2 receptor but highly conserved among SARScoronaviruses. This epitope encompasses a glycosylation site (N343) of the viral spike protein. Administration of SW186 in mice after they were infected withSARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, or Delta variants reduced the viral loads in the lung.These results demonstrated that SW186 neutralizes diverse SARS coronaviruses bybinding to a conserved RBD epitope, which could serve as a target for furtherantibody development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide an analysis of A. baumannii complex (ABC) isolatedfrom blood cultures in South Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ABC surveillance was conducted from 1 April 2017 to 30 September 2019 at 19 hospital sites from blood cultures of any age and sex. Organism identification was performed using theMALDI-TOF MS and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), MicroScan WalkawaySystem. We confirmed colistin resistance with Sensititre, FRCOL panel, andselected for whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: During the study period, weidentified 4822 cases of ABC, of which 2152 cases were from 19 enhancedsurveillance sites were reported during the enhanced surveillance period (1August 2018 to 30 September 2019). Males accounted for 54% (2611/4822). Of thecases with known age, 41% (1968/4822) were infants (< 1-year-old). Seventy-eight percent (1688/2152) of cases had a known hospital outcome, of which 36%(602/1688) died. HIV status was known for 69% (1168/1688) of cases, and 14%(238/1688) were positive. Eighty-two percent (1389/1688) received antimicrobialtreatment in admission. Three percent (35/1389) of cases received singlecolistin. Four percent (75/2033) were resistant to colistin. At least 75% of the isolates (1530/2033) can be classified as extensively drug-resistant (XDR), with resistance to most antibiotics except for colistin. The majority, 83% (20/24), ofthe colistin-resistant isolates were of the sequence type (ST) 1. Resistancegenes, both plasmid- and chromosomal- mediated were not observed. Although allisolates had, nine efflux pump genes related to antimicrobial resistance.CONCLUSION: Our surveillance data contributed to a better understanding of thenatural course of A. baumannii disease, the patient characteristics amonginfants, and the level of resistance. At least two-thirds of the isolates wereextensively drug-resistant, and four percent of isolates were resistant tocolistin.

AB  - Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) reside in a specialized niche that ensures theirregenerative capacity. Although we know that innate immune cells infiltrate theniche in response to injury, it remains unclear how MuSCs adapt to this alteredenvironment for initiating repair. Here, we demonstrate that inflammatorycytokine signaling from the regenerative niche impairs the ability of quiescentMuSCs to reenter the cell cycle. The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylaseJMJD3, but not UTX, allowed MuSCs to overcome inhibitory inflammation signalingby removing trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) marks at the Has2 locus to initiateproduction of hyaluronic acid, which in turn established an extracellular matrix competent for integrating signals that direct MuSCs to exit quiescence. Thus,JMJD3-driven hyaluronic acid synthesis plays a proregenerative role that allowsMuSC adaptation to inflammation and the initiation of muscle repair.

TI  - A conserved Bacteroidetes antigen induces anti-inflammatory intestinal Tlymphocytes.
PG  - 660-666
LID - 10.1126/science.abg5645 [doi]
AB  - The microbiome contributes to the development and maturation of the immunesystem. In response to commensal bacteria, intestinal CD4(+) T lymphocytesdifferentiate into functional subtypes with regulatory or effector functions. Thedevelopment of small intestine intraepithelial lymphocytes that coexpress CD4 andCD8alphaalpha homodimers (CD4IELs) depends on the microbiota. However, theidentity of the microbial antigens recognized by CD4(+) T cells that candifferentiate into CD4IELs remains unknown. We identified beta-hexosaminidase, a conserved enzyme across commensals of the Bacteroidetes phylum, as a driver ofCD4IEL differentiation. In a mouse model of colitis, beta-hexosaminidase-specificlymphocytes protected against intestinal inflammation. Thus, T cells of a single specificity can recognize a variety of abundant commensals and elicit aregulatory immune response at the intestinal mucosa.

TI  - Occurrence of Lymphatic Filariasis infection after 15 years of mass drugadministration in two hotspot districts in the Upper East Region of Ghana.
PG  - e0010129
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) causes chronic morbidity, which usuallymanifests as lymphedema or hydrocele. Mass drug administration (MDA) began inKassena Nankana East Municipal (KNEM) and Nabdam, two hotspot districts in theUpper East Region in Ghana, in 2000 and 2005, respectively. This cross-sectional study evaluated the impact of 15 years of MDA on the control of LF as determined by circulating filarial antigen (CFA) and microfilariae assessment in the KNEMand the Nabdam districts. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 7,453participants from eight sub-districts in the two hotspot districts (KNEM: N =4604; Nabdam: N = 2849) were recruited into the study. The overall CFA prevalenceas determined by the FTS was 19.6% and 12.8% in the KNEM and Nabdam districts,respectively. Manyoro, a sub-district on the border with Burkina Faso, recordedthe highest CFA prevalence of 26% in the KNEM. Assessment of microfilariae andOg4C3 antigen was done from 1009 (KNEM: N = 799 (79.2%); Nabdam: N = 210 (20.8%))randomly selected FTS-positive (N = 885) and FTS-negative (N = 124) individuals. The Og4C3 antigen was found in 22.6%/23.0% of the selected individuals(KNEM/Nabdam), whereas the night blood revealed microfilariae in only 0.7%/0.5%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Using the WHO endorsed FTS, CFA prevalence exceeded thelong-standing <2% threshold-which may need revision and validation. Surprisingly,the Og4C3 ELISA showed positive results in only about one-fifth of the FTSpositive samples. However, even this result would not have met the <2% CFAcriteria for LF elimination. In contrast, projections from the microfilariaeresults revealed a halt in LF transmission. The global elimination target was duein 2020 but has been extended to 2030 since this could not be met. Focused MDAintervention intensification on seasonal migrants and non-compliers, andimplementation of alternative treatment strategies may suffice for theelimination of the disease.

TI  - Computational approach to modeling microbiome landscapes associated with chronic human disease progression.
PG  - e1010373
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010373 [doi]
AB  - A microbial community is a dynamic system undergoing constant change in response to internal and external stimuli. These changes can have significant implicationsfor human health. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining longitudinalsamples, the study of the dynamic relationship between the microbiome and humanhealth remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a novel computational strategythat uses massive cross-sectional sample data to model microbiome landscapesassociated with chronic disease development. The strategy is based on therationale that each static sample provides a snapshot of the disease process, andif the number of samples is sufficiently large, the footprints of individualsamples populate progression trajectories, which enables us to recover diseaseprogression paths along a microbiome landscape by using computational approaches.To demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy, we developed abioinformatics pipeline and applied it to a gut microbiome dataset available froma Crohn's disease study. Our analysis resulted in one of the first working modelsof microbial progression for Crohn's disease. We performed a series ofinterrogations to validate the constructed model. Our analysis suggested that themodel recapitulated the longitudinal progression of microbial dysbiosis duringthe known clinical trajectory of Crohn's disease. By overcoming restrictionsassociated with complex longitudinal sampling, the proposed strategy can provide valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of chronic disease and facilitate the shift of the field from descriptive research tomechanistic studies.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells (PCs), has diverse geneticunderpinnings and in rare cases these include amplification of the lymphotoxin b receptor (Ltbr) locus. LTbetaR has well defined roles in supporting lymphoidtissue development and function through actions in stromal and myeloid cells, butwhether it is functional in PCs is unknown. Here we showed that Ltbr mRNA wasupregulated in mouse PCs compared to follicular B cells, but deficiency in thereceptor did not cause a reduction in PC responses to a T-dependent orT-independent immunogen. However, LTbetaR overexpression (OE) enhanced PCformation in vitro after LPS or anti-CD40 stimulation. In vivo, LTbetaR OE led toincreased antigen-specific splenic and bone marrow (BM) plasma cells responses.LTbetaR OE PCs had increased expression of Nfkb2 and of the NF-kB target genesBcl2 and Mcl1, factors involved in the formation of long-lived BM PCs. Ourfindings suggest a pathway by which Ltbr gene amplifications may contribute to MMdevelopment through increased NF-kB activity and induction of an anti-apoptotictranscriptional program.

AB  - Five endophytic bacterial isolates were studied to identify morphologically andbiochemically, according to established protocols and further confirmed by 16SrDNA Sanger sequencing, as Priestia megaterium, Staphylococcus caprae,Neobacillus drentensis, Micrococcus yunnanensis, and Sphingomonas paucimobiliz,which were then tested for phytohormone, ammonia, and hydrolytic enzymeproduction. Antioxidant compounds total phenolic content (TPC), and totalflavonoid content (TFC) were assessed by using bacterial crude extracts obtained from 24-hour shake-flask culture. Phylogenetic tree analysis of those identified isolates shared sequence similarities with the members of Bacillus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas species, and after GenBank submission, accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences were found to be MW494406, MW494408,MW494401, MW494402, and MZ021340, respectively. In silico analysis was performed to identify their bioactive genes and compounds in the context of bioactivesecondary metabolite production with medicinal value, where nine significantbioactive compounds according to six different types of bioactive secondarymetabolites were identified, and their structures, gene associations, andprotein-protein networks were analyzed by different computational tools andservers, which were reported earlier with their antimicrobial, anti-infective,antioxidant, and anti-cancer capabilities. These compounds were then docked tothe 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of the novel SARS-COV-2. Docking scoreswere then compared with 3CLpro reference inhibitor (lopinavir), and dockedcompounds were further subjected to ADMET and drug-likeness analyses.Ligand-protein interactions showed that two compounds (microansamycin andaureusimine) interacted favorably with coronavirus 3CLpro. Besides, in silicoanalysis, we also performed NMR for metabolite detection whereas threemetabolites (microansamycin, aureusimine, and stenothricin) were confirmed fromthe 1H NMR profiles. As a consequence, the metabolites found from NMR dataaligned with our in-silico analysis that carries a significant outcome of thisresearch. Finally, Endophytic bacteria collected from medicinal plants canprovide new leading bioactive compounds against target proteins of SARS-COV-2,which could be an effective approach to accelerate drug innovation anddevelopment.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can cause some individuals to experience chronic symptoms.Rates and predictors of chronic COVID-19 symptoms are not fully elucidated.OBJECTIVE: To examine occurrence and patterns of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV2infection (PASC) symptomatology and their relationship with demographics, acuteCOVID-19 symptoms and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses. METHODS: Amulti-stage observational study was performed of adults (>/=18 years) from 5 USstates. Participants completed two rounds of electronic surveys (May-July 2020;April-May 2021) and underwent testing to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein IgGantibody testing. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify clusters of chronic COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 390 adults (median [25%ile, 75%ile] age: 42 [31, 54] years) with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies completed the follow-upsurvey; 92 (24.7%) had >/=1 chronic COVID-19 symptom, with 11-month medianduration of persistent symptoms (range: 1-12 months). The most common chronicCOVID-19 symptoms were fatigue (11.3%), change in smell (9.5%) or taste (5.6%),muscle or joint aches (5.4%) and weakness (4.6%). There were significantly higherproportions of >/=1 persistent COVID-19 symptom (31.5% vs. 18.6%; Chi-square, P =0.004), and particularly fatigue (15.8% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.008) and headaches (5.4% vs. 1.0%, P = 0.011) in females compared to males. Chronic COVID-19 symptoms werealso increased in individuals with >/=6 acute COVID-19 symptoms, Latent classanalysis revealed 4 classes of symptoms. Latent class-1 (change of smell andtaste) was associated with lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels; class-2 and 3(multiple chronic symptoms) were associated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and more severe acute COVID-19 infection. LIMITATIONS: Ambulatory cohortwith less severe acute disease. CONCLUSION: Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infectioncommonly experience chronic symptoms, most commonly fatigue, changes in smell or taste and muscle/joint aches. Female sex, severity of acute COVID-19 infection,and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were associated with the highest risk ofhaving chronic COVID-19 symptoms.

TI  - A time-course comparative clinical and immune response evaluation study betweenthe human pathogenic Orientia tsutsugamushi strains: Karp and Gilliam in a rhesusmacaque (Macaca mulatta) model.
PG  - e0010611
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010611 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is a vector-borne febrile illness caused by Orientiatsutsugamushi transmitted by the bite of Trombiculid mites. O. tsutsugamushi has a high genetic diversity and is increasingly recognized to have a wider globaldistribution than previously assumed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Weevaluated the clinical outcomes and host immune responses of the two mostrelevant human pathogenic strains of O. tsutsugamushi; Karp (n = 4) and Gilliam(n = 4) in a time-course study over 80 days post infection (dpi) in astandardized scrub typhus non-human primate rhesus macaque model. We observeddistinct features in clinical progression and immune response between the twostrains; Gilliam-infected macaques developed more pronounced systemic infectioncharacterized by an earlier onset of bacteremia, lymph node enlargement, escharlesions and higher inflammatory markers during the acute phase of infection, whencompared to the Karp strain. C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels, interferongamma (IFN-gamma, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-15 serumconcentrations, CRP/IL10- and IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratios correlated positively withbacterial load in blood, implying activation of the innate immune response andpreferential development of a T helper-type 1 immune response. The O.tsutsugamushi-specific immune memory responses in cells isolated from skin andlymph nodes at 80 dpi were more markedly elevated in the Gilliam-infectedmacaques than in the Karp-infected group. The comparative cytokine responsedynamics of both strains revealed significant up-regulation of IFN-gamma, tumornecrosis factor (TNF), IL-15, IL-6, IL-18, regulatory IL-1ra, IL-10, IL-8 andgranulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). These data suggest that theclinical outcomes and host immune responses to scrub typhus could be associatedwith counter balancing effects of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine-mediatedresponses. Currently, no data on characterized time-course comparisons of O.tsutsugamushi strains regarding measures of disease severity and immune response is available. Our study provides evidence for the strain-specificity of hostresponses in scrub typhus, which supports our understanding of processes at theinitial inoculation site (eschar), systemic disease progression, protectiveand/or pathogenic host immune mechanisms and cellular immune memory function.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study characterised an improved intradermal rhesusmacaque challenge model for scrub typhus, whereby the Gilliam strain infectionassociated with higher disease severity in the rhesus macaque model than theprevious Karp strain infection. Difficulties associated with inoculumquantitation for obligate-intracellular bacteria were overcome by usingfunctional inoculum titrations in outbred mice. The Gilliam-based rhesus macaque model provides improved endpoint measurements and contributes towards theidentification of correlates of protection for future vaccine development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria elimination effort is hampered not only by the lack ofeffective medication but also due to the lack of sensitive diagnostic tools todetect infections with low levels of parasitemia. Therefore, more sensitive andspecific high-throughput molecular diagnostic approaches are needed for accurate malaria diagnosis. METHODS: In the present study, the performance of a novelsingle-tube MC004 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (MRC-Holland,Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was assessed for the detection of infection anddiscrimination of Plasmodium species. Blood samples (n = 150) were collected frommalaria suspected patients at Adama malaria diagnosis and treatment centre,Adama, central Ethiopia. The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictivevalue (NPV), analytical sensitivity and specificity of the assay were assessedagainst the conventional microscopic method. RESULTS: Plasmodium species weredetected in 59 (39.3%) of the samples by microscopy and in 62 (41.3%) by thenovel MC004 RT-PCR. Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and mixed infections with Plasmodium falciparum & Plasmodium vivax accounted for 47.5%, 40.6% and11.9% respectively as detected by microscopy. The MC004 RT-PCR assay identified59.7% and 40.3% of the samples positive for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodiumfalciparum respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the MC004 RT-PCR assay were 95.8%, 97.8%, 92%, and 98.9%, respectively. No mixed infectionswere detected using the MC004 assay. CONCLUSION: The MC004 RT-PCR assay is auseful tool for the early detection of malaria and identification of Plasmodiumspecies with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Due to its highsensitivity, and simplicity (being a single-tube assay), the MC004 is suitablefor use in clinical settings and epidemiological studies.

Although not as prevalent ineukaryotes compared to bacteria, horizontal gene transfer events can also result in key adaptations for insects, especially for those involved in insect-microbeinteractions. In this study we assemble the first chromosomal assembly of thepsyllid Bactericera cockerelli and reveal that the B. cockerelli genome hasexperienced significantly more gene expansion events compared to other Hemipteranrepresentatives with fully sequenced genomes. We also reveal that B. cockerelli'sgenome is the largest psyllid genome (567 Mb) sequenced to date and is ~15%larger than the other two psyllid species genomes sequenced (Pachypsylla venusta and Diaphorina citri). Structurally, B. cockerelli appears to have an additional chromosome compared to the distantly related psyllid species P. venusta due to a previous chromosomal fission or fusion event. The increase in genome size anddynamic nature of the B. cockerelli genome may largely be contributed to thewidespread expansion of type I and type II repeat elements that are rampantacross all of B. cockerelli's. chromosomes. These repeat elements are distributednear equally in both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. Furthermore,significant gene family expansions and gene duplications were uncovered for genesthat are expected to be important in its adaptation to insect-plant and microbeinteractions, which include transcription factors, proteases, odorant receptors, and horizontally transferred genes that are involved in the nutritional symbioseswith their long-term nutritional endosymbiont Carsonella.

TI  - Mapping Strengths and Weaknesses of Different Clustering Approaches toDeciphering Bacterial Chimerism.
LID - 10.1089/omi.2022.0062 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial genomes are chimeras of DNA of different ancestries. Deconstructingchimeric genomes is central to understanding the evolutionary trajectories oftheir disparate components and thus the organisms as a whole in the light oftheir evolutionary contexts. Of specific interest is to delineate and quantifynative (vertically inherited) and alien (horizontally acquired) components ofbacterial genomes and also specify genomic fractions that represent differentdonor sources. An agglomerative clustering procedure that prioritizes grouping ofproximal similar genomic segments has previously been invoked for this purpose inconjunction with a recursive segmentation procedure. Surprisingly, however, therelative strengths and weaknesses of different clustering approaches todeciphering bacterial chimerism have not yet been investigated, despite the need to robustly interpret tens of thousands of completely sequenced bacterial genomesand nearly complete genome assemblies available in the public databases. Tobridge this knowledge gap and develop more robust approaches, we assesseddifferent clustering methods, including segment order based (proximal)clustering, hierarchical clustering, affinity propagation clustering, and a novelnetwork clustering approach on chimeric genomes modeled after bacterial genomesrepresenting a broad spectrum of compositional complexity. Although segmentorder-based clustering and network clustering compared favorably with the otherapproaches in discriminating between native and alien DNA at genome optimizedsettings, network clustering did consistently better than other methods atparametric settings optimized on all test genomes together. Segment order-basedclustering and hierarchical clustering outperformed other methods in alien DNAidentification while preserving donor identity in the genomes. Our studyhighlights the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and suggests how this can be leveraged to achieve a more robust deconstruction of bacterialchimerism.

LID - e157248 [pii]
AB  - Evidence suggests that increased microRNA-155 (miR-155) expression in immunecells enhances anti-tumor immune responses. However, given the reportedassociation of miR-155 to tumorigenesis in various cancers, a debate is provoked on whether miR-155 is oncogenic or tumor suppressive. We aimed to interrogate theimpact of tumor miR-155 expression, particularly cancer cell-derived miR-155, on anti-tumor immunity in breast cancer. We performed bioinformatic analysis ofhuman breast cancer databases, murine experiments, and human specimenexamination. We revealed that higher tumor miR-155 levels correlate with afavorable anti-tumor immune profile and better patient outcomes. Murineexperiments demonstrated that miR-155 overexpression in breast cancer cellsenhanced T cell influx, delayed tumor growth, and sensitized the tumors to immunecheckpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Mechanistically, miR-155 overexpression inbreast cancer cells upregulated their CXCL9/10/11 production, which was mediated by SOCS1 inhibition and increased pSTAT1/pSTAT3 ratio. We further found thatserum miR-155 levels in breast cancer patients correlate with tumor miR-155levels and tumor immune status. Our findings suggest that high serum and tumormiR-155 levels may be a favorable prognostic marker for breast cancer patients,and therapeutic elevation of miR-155 in breast tumors may improve the efficacy ofICB therapy via remodeling the anti-tumor immune landscape.

TI  - A unique global metabolic trait of Pseudomonas bharatica CSV86(T): metabolism of aromatics over simple carbon sources and co-metabolism with organic acids.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001206 [doi]
AB  - Hierarchical utilization of substrate by microbes (utilization of simple carbonsources prior to complex ones) poses a major limitation to the efficientremediation of aromatic pollutants. Aromatic compounds, being complex and reducedin nature, appear to be a deferred choice as the carbon source in the presence ofa plethora of simple organic compounds in the environment. The soil bacteriumPseudomonas bharatica CSV86(T) displays a unique carbon source utilizationhierarchy. It preferentially utilizes aromatics over glucose and co-metabolizesthem with succinate or pyruvate (Basu et al., 2006, Applied and EnvironmentalMicrobiology, 72 : 22226-2230). In the present study, the substrate utilizationhierarchy for strain CSV86(T) was tested for additional simple carbon sourcessuch as glycerol, acetate, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates likealpha-ketoglutarate and fumarate. When grown on a mixture of aromatics (benzoate or naphthalene) plus glycerol, the strain displayed a diauxic growth profile withsignificantly high activity of aromatic utilization enzymes (catechol 1,2- or2,3-dioxygenase, respectively) in the first-log phase. This suggests utilization of aromatics in the first-log phase followed by glycerol in the second-log phase.On a mixture of an aromatic plus organic acid (acetate, alpha-ketoglutarate orfumarate), the strain displayed a monoauxic growth profile, indicatingco-metabolism. Interestingly, the presence of glycerol, acetate,alpha-ketoglutarate or fumarate does not repress metabolism/utilization of thearomatic. Thus, the substrate utilization hierarchy of strain CSV86(T) isaromatics=organic acids>glucose/glycerol, which is unique as compared to otherPseudomonas species, where degradation of aromatics is repressed by glycerol,glucose, acetate or organic acids, including TCA cycle intermediates. This novel substrate utilization hierarchy appears to be a global metabolic phenomenon instrain CSV86(T), thus implying it to be an ideal host for metabolic engineeringas well as for its potential application in bioremediation.

TI  - Mechanisms of beta-adrenergic receptors agonists in mediating pro andanti-apoptotic pathways in hyperglycemic Muller cells.
LID - 10.1007/s11033-022-07816-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study aimed to investigate the stimulatory effect ofbeta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) on brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). METHODS: Human Muller cellswere cultured in low and high glucose conditions. Cells were treated withxamoterol (selective agonist for beta1-AR), salmeterol (selective agonist forbeta2-AR), isoproterenol (beta-ARs agonist) and propranolol (beta-ARsantagonist), at 20 microM concentration for 24 h. Western Blotting assay wasperformed for the gene expression analysis. DNA damage was evaluated by TUNELassay. DCFH-DA assay was used to check the level of reactive oxygen species(ROS). Cytochrome C release was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Xamoterol, salmeteroland isoproterenol showed no effect on Caspase-8 but it reduced the apoptosis and increased the expression of BDNF in Muller cells. A significant change in theexpression of caspase-3 was observed in cells treated with xamoterol andsalmeterol as compared to isoproterenol. Xamoterol, salmeterol and isoproterenol significantly decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) when treated for 24hours. Glucose-induced cytochrome c release was disrupted in Muller cells.CONCLUSION: beta-ARs, stimulated by agonist play a protective role inhyperglycemic Muller cells, with the suppression of glucose-induced caspase-3 andcytochrome c release. B-Ars may directly mediate the gene expression of BDNF.

TI  - Distribution of microbial communities in seasonally frozen soil layers on theTibetan Plateau and the driving environmental factors.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22283-7 [doi]
AB  - Large stocks of carbon and nitrogen stored in permafrost regions can potentially feed back to global biogeochemical cycles under climate warming. To understandthe response of microbial communities to environmental changes, this studyinvestigated the spatial distribution of bacterial communities in the upperlayers (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) of seasonally frozen soil on the TibetanPlateau and their relationships with the environmental factors. A total of 135soil samples were collected from the soils at depths of 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cmin the Lhasa River and Nyang River basins, and the diversity and composition ofbacterial communities in them were identified by high-throughput 16S rRNA genesequencing. Bacterial diversity changed significantly with soil depth in theNyang River basin (p < 0.001), while no obvious change was found in the LhasaRiver basin. The whole bacterial composition exhibited small variations acrossdifferent soil layers (p > 0.05). The relative abundance of aerobic bacteria,Sphingomonas and Arthrobacter, decreased with soil depth, while that of the otheraerobic, facultative anaerobic, and anaerobic bacteria did not exhibit thistrend. Soil pH was the key driving edaphic factor of the whole bacterialcomposition in all three depth layers, while vegetation also had an importantinfluence on bacterial composition. Arthrobacter, Bradyrhizobium, and Bacillushad obvious correlations with soil nutrients or vegetation, while the otherspecies were not significantly correlated with any environmental factors.Structural equation modeling revealed that vegetation and mean annual temperaturehad a key direct impact on the bacterial diversity and composition, respectively.Climate also indirectly affected bacterial communities, mainly through shapingsoil pH and vegetation. These results indicate that the soil depth has adifferent impact on the bacterial alpha-diversity, whole bacterial composition,and specific taxa in the 0-30-cm surface layers of seasonally frozen soil, which were mainly determined by various environmental factors.

TI  - Uncertainty-aware dynamic integration for multi-omics classification of tumors.
LID - 10.1007/s00432-022-04219-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Omics data are crucial for medical diagnosis as it contains intrinsicbiomedical information. Multi-omics integrated analysis has become a newdirection for scientists to explore life mechanisms. Nevertheless, the quality ofcomplex omics data often varies greatly due to different samples or evendifferent omics types, it is challenging to dynamically capture the uncertaintyfor different kinds of omics data. METHODS: This paper proposes auncertainty-aware dynamic integration framework for multi-omics classification.The framework consists of three modules: deep embedding, confidence prediction,and downstream tasks. The deep embedding module extract key information frommulti-omics data to obtain a low-dimensional feature representation which is usedto train downstream tasks. Combined with the deep embedding module, theconfidence prediction module is used to dynamically capture the uncertainty ofthe data. We introduce "confidNet" to assign a confidence value for each type of omics data, which is used for dynamic integration between multi-omics. RESULTS:Compared with other integration methods, the proposed method can contain morecrucial biomedical information in the obtained low-dimensional representation.Our framework realizes reliable integration among multiple omics, and it canstill achieve high accuracy on small sample data sets. We have verified theeffectiveness of the model in a large number of experiments. CONCLUSION: Ourframework can be widely applied to high-dimensional omics data and has greatpotential to facilitate medical decision-making and biological analysis.

AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen, and the cause of nosocomial infections worldwide in recent decades. Efflux pumps are considered asthe important causes of multidrug resistance of A. baumannii. The aim of thisstudy was to determine the frequency of efflux pump genes, and evaluate theantibiotic effect of Tigecycline on the expression of adeB gene in isolates ofmultidrug-resistant. A. baumannii. 70 isolates of A. baumannii were collected andconfirmed by biochemical and molecular tests. Antibiotic resistance(Ciprofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline) was performedbased on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Then, the effect ofCarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone inhibitor (CCCP) on isolates wasinvestigated and the frequency of adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM genes were examinedby PCR for isolates with reduced in MIC titer. Also, the antibiotic effect ofTigecycline on adeB gene expression in A. baumannii isolates was analyzed byReal-Time PCR. The antibiotic resistance for Ciprofloxacin,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline was 97.1%, 95.8% and 37.2%,respectively. Following CCCP inhibitor use, the MIC titer had a decrease in MICtiter containing CCCP inhibitor was 64.3% for Ciprofloxacin, 51.5% forTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 50% for Tigecycline. The frequencies of genesassociated with adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM efflux pump were 100%, 92.8%, 86% and98.5%, respectively. Real-Time PCR results showed a correlation between theantibiotic effects of Tigecycline on adeB gene expression. The antibioticresistance of the isolates was relatively high. The isolates were resistant toCiprofloxacin and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotics, while more sensitiveto Tigecycline. Also, efflux pump genes, which are the antibiotic resistancefactors of A. baumannii, are frequently high in the isolates but it seems thatisolates use other effluxe pumps than RND family to exit tigecycline.

TI  - Cover Crop Amendments and Lettuce Plant Growth Stages Alter RhizobacterialProperties and Roles in Plant Performance.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-022-02090-w [doi]
AB  - Lettuce plants respond differently to cover crop amendments by altering theirbiomass and nitrogen uptake (Nup) at different plant growth stages. Nonetheless, plant-microbe interactions involved in the alterations are scarcely studied. Thisstudy elucidated how the properties of the soil microbial community inhabitingthe rhizosphere associated with lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa "Redfire") change during plant growth stages. Lettuce plants were cultivated incontrol soil and soil with rye, hairy vetch (HV), and rye plus HV (rye + HV)cover crop amendments. Rhizosphere soil samples were collected at the mid-growth and mature stages of plant development. DNA was extracted from the soil, and the 16S rRNA region was amplified using polymerase chain reaction to analyzebacterial genes and community structures and functions. Cover crop amendments andplant growth stages increased or decreased the relative abundances of bacterialtaxa at the genus level. Plant maturity decreased 16S rRNA gene expression andthe number of bacterial operational taxonomic units in all treatments. Theunique, core, and shared taxa with low relative abundances may be associated withimproved lettuce Nup and lettuce shoot and root biomass at each plant growthstage under different cover crop amendments based on multivariate analysisbetween plant indicators and bacterial genera groups. This study revealed theimportance of bacterial groups with low relative abundance in plant-microbeinteractions; such bacteria may promote the cover crop application for highlettuce productivity.

AB  - The human body comprises around 600 lymph nodes as constituents of adecentralized and dispersed immune system. The main task of lymph nodes iscleaning the lymph fluid and defending the organism against outer and innerthreats by bacteria, viruses and tumour cells. The histologic picture of lymphnodes reflects the different strategies of the innate and adaptive immune system,which allocates antigen presenting cells, macrophages, B and Tcell systems andreticulum cells. However, the histological picture, without any additionalinvestigations, usually only allows speculation about the causative agent liketoxoplasmosis, other bacteria or viruses. This chapter describes different lymph node reactions in detail in order to obtain a better understanding of specificimmune reactions allowing a precise diagnosis and a reliable distinction frommalignant processes. The last issue in particular is one of the main tasks ofhaematopathology. In addition to these known principles, we try to integrateresults obtained with the new method of three-dimensional (3D) microscopy offixed lymphoid tissue. At first glance, this seems to be unusual. Nevertheless,we try to apply this approach, since 3D visualization of morphological detailsprovides distinct cellular details as well as new interpretations of cell-cellinteractions and the functions of lymphoid compartments, like germinal centresand Tzones.

TI  - Cell wall deficiency - an alternate bacterial lifestyle?
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001218 [doi]
AB  - Historically, many species of bacteria have been reported to produce viable, cellwall deficient (CWD) variants. A variety of terms have been used to refer to CWD bacteria and a plethora of methods described in which to induce, cultivate andpropagate them. In this review, we will examine the long history of scientificresearch on CWD bacteria examining the methods by which CWD bacteria aregenerated; the requirements for survival in a CWD state; the replicativeprocesses within a CWD state; and the reversion of CWD bacteria into a walledstate, or lack thereof. In doing so, we will present evidence that not all CWDvariants are alike and that, at least in some cases, CWD variants arise throughan adaptive lifestyle switch that enables them to live and thrive without a cell wall, often to avoid antimicrobial activity. Finally, the implications of CWDbacteria in recurring infections, tolerance to antibiotic therapy andantimicrobial resistance will be examined to illustrate the importance of greaterunderstanding of the CWD bacteria in human health and disease.

TI  - Niche differentiation of atmospheric methane-oxidizing bacteria and theircommunity assembly in subsurface karst caves.
LID - 10.1111/1758-2229.13112 [doi]
AB  - Karst caves are recently proposed as atmospheric methane sinks in terrestrialecosystems. Despite of the detection of atmospheric methane-oxidizing bacteria(atmMOB) in caves, we still know little about their ecology and potential abilityof methane oxidation in this ecosystem. To understand atmMOB ecology and theirpotential in methane consumption, we collected weathered rocks and sediments fromthree different caves in southwestern China. We determined the potential methane oxidization rates in the range of 1.25 +/- 0.08 to 1.87 +/- 0.41 ng CH4 g(-1) DW h(-1) , which are comparable to those reported in forest and grassland soils.Results showed that alkaline oligotrophic caves harbour high numbers of atmMOB,particularly upland soil cluster (USC), which significantly correlated withtemperature, CH4 and CO2 concentrations. The absolute abundance of USCgamma washigher than that of USCalpha. USCgamma-OPS (open patch soil) and USCgamma-SS(subsurface soil) dominated in most samples, whereas USCalpha-BFS (boreal forest soil) only predominated in the sediments near cave entrances, indicating nichedifferentiation of atmMOB in caves. Overwhelming dominance of homogenousselection in community assembly resulted in convergence of atmMOB communities.Collectively, our results demonstrated the niche differentiation of USC insubsurface alkaline caves and their non-negligible methane-oxidizing potential,providing brand-new knowledge about atmMOB ecology in subsurface biosphere.

TI  - Correlation between metabolites of lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairytraditional fermented Tunisian products and antifungal and antioxidantactivities.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15763 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study is to identify and investigate the antifungaland antioxidant potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditionalfermented products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this work, a collection of LAB wasisolated from traditional fermented products collected in four Tunisian regions. After first screening using the overlay method, seven bacterial strains wereretained due to their high antifungal effect. Four strains of Limosilactobacillusfermentum were identified, one strain of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, one strainof Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. Theantifungal as well as the antioxidant potential of these bacteria were thenevaluated. Bacterial strains were effective against six fungal strains with aminimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 25 to 100 mg/mL and a minimumfungicidal concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 mg/mL. Cell free supernatants ofLAB were analyzed by HPLC-DAD and LC-MS-qTOF-MS analysis. Results showedsignificant production of organic acids as well as several phenolic compounds.Correlation analysis confirmed that PLA and 1,2-Dihydroxybenzene were positively correlated with antifungal potential. The results of the antioxidant activityhighlighted an ABTS radical cation scavenging activity ranging from 49% to 57%and a DPPH trapping percentage ranging from 80% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore,due to these characteristics, identified lactic acid bacteria strains have shown their effectiveness to perform as antifungal and antioxidant agents. SIGNIFICANCEAND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Since microbial contamination is at the root ofextensive losses in the food sector, the identified strains or their metabolites can potentially be used as additives to limit microorganism spoilage in foodproducts and increase their shelf life.

TI  - Phytochemical profile, bioactivity and prebiotic potential of bound polyphenolsreleased from Rosa roxburghii fruit pomace dietary fiber during in vitrodigestion and fermentation.
LID - 10.1039/d2fo00823h [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate the liberation and phytochemical profileof bound polyphenols present in dietary fiber (RPDF) isolated from Rosaroxburghii fruit pomace during in vitro-simulated digestion and colonicfermentation. The variation in the biological activity and prebiotic potential ofthe released polyphenols from RPDF was investigated. The results showed that the bound polyphenols were released from RPDF at a higher ratio during colonicfermentation than gastrointestinal digestion. The released polyphenols showedantioxidant activity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The in vitrocolonic fermentation assay showed that compared with dephenolized RPDF (DP-RPDF),RPDF exhibited a significantly stronger prebiotic effect by lowering theFirmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio at the phylum level, increasing therelative abundances of beneficial bacteria at the genus level, and improving the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These findings indicate that thebound polyphenols may act as important functional food ingredients that cancontribute to the biological properties of RPDF. In addition, this study providesnew insights into the high-value utilization of Rosa roxburghii fruit pomace,which will reduce the wastage of resources and greatly contribute toenvironmental protection.

TI  - Manipulation and exploitation of host immune system by pathogenic Mycobacteriumtuberculosis for its advantage.
LID - 10.2217/fmb-2022-0026 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can become a long-term infection by evading the host immune response. Coevolution of Mtb with humans has resulted in its ability to hijack the host's immune systems in a variety of ways. So far, every Mtbdefense strategy is essentially dependent on a subtle balance that, if shifted,can promote Mtb proliferation in the host, resulting in disease progression. Inthis review, the authors summarize many important and previously unknownmechanisms by which Mtb evades the host immune response. Besides recently foundstrategies by which Mtb manipulates the host molecular regulatory machinery ofinnate and adaptive immunity, including the intranuclear regulatory machinery,costimulatory molecules, the ubiquitin system and cellular intrinsic immunecomponents will be discussed. A holistic understanding of these immune-evasionmechanisms is of foremost importance for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis and will lead to new insights into tuberculosis pathogenesis and the development of more effective vaccines and treatment regimens.

TI  - Characterization of the (Engineered) Branching Sucrase GtfZ-CD2 fromApilactobacillus kunkeei for Efficient Glucosylation of Benzenediol Compounds.
PG  - e0103122
LID - 10.1128/aem.01031-22 [doi]
AB  - Branching sucrases, a subfamily of Glycoside Hydrolase family (GH70), displaytransglycosidase activity using sucrose as donor substrate to catalyzeglucosylation reaction in the presence of suitable acceptor substrates. In thisstudy, the (alpha1-->3) branching sucrase GtfZ-CD2 from Apilactobacillus kunkeei DSM 12361 was demonstrated to glucosylate benzenediol compounds (i.e., catechol, resorcinol, and hydroquinone) to form monoglucoside and diglucoside products. Theproduction and yield of catechol glucosylated products were significantly higher than that of resorcinol and hydroquinone, revealing a preference for adjacentaromatic hydroxyl groups in glucosylation. Amino residues around acceptorsubstrate binding subsite +1 were targeted for semirational mutagenesis, yieldingGtfZ-CD2 variants with improved resorcinol and hydroquinone glucosylation. MutantL1560Y with improved hydroquinone mono-glucosylated product synthesis allowedenzymatic conversion of hydroquinone into alpha-arbutin. This study thus revealedthe high potential of GH70 branching sucrases for glucosylating noncarbohydratemolecules. IMPORTANCE Glycosylation represents one of the most important ways to expand the diversity of natural products and improve their physico-chemicalproperties. Aromatic polyphenol compounds widely found in plants are reported to exhibit various remarkable biological activities; however, they generally suffer from low solubility and stability, which can be improved by glycosylation. Ourpresent study on the glucosylation of benzenediol compounds by GH70 branchingsucrase GtfZ-CD2 and its semirational engineering to improve the glucosylationefficiency provides insight into the mechanism of acceptor substrates binding andits glucosylation selectivity. The results demonstrate the potential of usingbranching sucrase as an effective enzymatic glucosylation tool.

TI  - Ruminal Microbiota Determines the High-Fiber Utilization of Ruminants: Evidencefrom the Ruminal Microbiota Transplant.
PG  - e0044622
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00446-22 [doi]
AB  - The rumen, which contains a series of prokaryotes and eukaryotes with highabundance, determines the high ability to degrade complex carbohydrates inruminants. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we compared the ruminal microbiota of dairy goats with that in the foregut and colon of mice and found more Bacteroidesidentified in the rumen, which helps ruminants to utilize plant-derivedpolysaccharides, cellulose, and other structural carbohydrates. Furthermore,high-fiber diets did not significantly increase intestinal fiber-degradingbacteria in mice, but did produce higher levels of ruminal fiber-degradingbacteria in dairy goats. Through rumen microbe transplantation (RMT), we foundthat rumen-derived fiber-degrading bacteria can colonize the intestines of miceto exert their fiber-degrading function, but their colonization efficiency isaffected by diet. Additionally, the colonization of these fiber-degradingbacteria in the colon may involve higher content of butyrate in the colon,protecting the colonic epithelial barrier and promoting energy metabolism.Overall, the fiber degradation function of rumen bacteria through RMT wasverified, and our results provide new insights into isolating the functional and beneficial fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen, providing a theoretical basisfor the role of dietary fiber in intestinal health. IMPORTANCE Ruminants have apowerful progastric digestive system that converts structural carbohydrates into nutrients useful to humans. It is well known that this phenomenon is due to thefact that the rumen of ruminants is a natural microbial fermenter, which canferment structural carbohydrates such as cellulose and hemicellulose andtransform them into volatile fatty acids to supply energy for host. However,monogastric animals have an inherent disadvantage in utilizing fiber, soscreening rumen-derived fiber-degrading bacteria as a fermentation strain forbiological feed is needed in an attempt at improving the fiber digestibility ofmonogastric animals. In this study, a ruminal microbiota transplant experimentfrom goats to mice proves that ruminal microbiota could serve as a key factor in utilization of high-fiber diets and provides a new perspective for thedevelopment of probiotics with fiber degradation function from the rumen and the importance of the use of prebiotics during the intake of probiotics.

TI  - Rotavirus VP4 Epitope of a Broadly Neutralizing Human Antibody Defined by ItsStructure Bound with an Attenuated-Strain Virion.
PG  - e0062722
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00627-22 [doi]
AB  - Rotavirus live-attenuated vaccines, both mono- and pentavalent, generate broadly heterotypic protection. B-cells isolated from adults encode neutralizingantibodies, some with affinity for VP5*, that afford broad protection in mice. Wehave mapped the epitope of one such antibody by determining the high-resolutioncryo-EM structure of its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) bound to the virion of a candidate vaccine strain, CDC-9. The Fab contacts both the distal end of a VP5*beta-barrel domain and the two VP8* lectin-like domains at the tip of aprojecting spike. Its interactions with VP8* do not impinge on the likelyreceptor-binding site, suggesting that the mechanism of neutralization is at astep subsequent to initial attachment. We also examined structures of CDC-9virions from two different stages of serial passaging. Nearly all the VP4(cleaved to VP8*/VP5*) spikes on particles from the earlier passage (wild-typeisolate) had transitioned from the "upright" conformation present on fullyinfectious virions to the "reversed" conformation that is probably the end state of membrane insertion, unable to mediate penetration, consistent with the verylow in vitro infectivity of the wild-type isolate. About half the VP4 spikes wereupright on particles from the later passage, which had recovered substantial invitro infectivity but had acquired an attenuated phenotype in neonatal rats. Amutation in VP4 that occurred during passaging appears to stabilize the interfaceat the apex of the spike and could account for the greater stability of theupright spikes on the late-passage, attenuated isolate. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruslive-attenuated vaccines generate broadly heterotypic protection, and B-cellsisolated from adults encode antibodies that are broadly protective in mice.Determining the structural and mechanistic basis of broad protection cancontribute to understanding the current limitations of vaccine efficacy indeveloping countries. The structure of an attenuated human rotavirus isolate(CDC-9) bound with the Fab fragment of a broadly heterotypic protective antibody shows that protection is probably due to inhibition of the conformationaltransition in the viral spike protein (VP4) critical for viral penetration,rather than to inhibition of receptor binding. A comparison of structures ofCDC-9 virus particles at two stages of serial passaging supports a proposedmechanism for initial steps in rotavirus membrane penetration.

TI  - Proteolytic Processing of the Coronavirus Replicase Nonstructural Protein 14Exonuclease Is Not Required for Virus Replication but Alters RNA Synthesis andViral Fitness.
PG  - e0084122
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00841-22 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) initiate replication by translation of the positive-senseRNA genome into the replicase polyproteins connecting 16 nonstructural proteindomains (nsp1-16), which are subsequently processed by viral proteases to yieldmature nsp. For the betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV), totalinhibition of translation or proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteinsresults in rapid cessation of RNA synthesis. The nsp5-3CLpro (Mpro) processesnsps7-16, which assemble into functional replication-transcription complexes(RTCs), including the enzymatic nsp12-RdRp and nsp14-exoribonuclease(ExoN)/N7-methyltransferase. The nsp14-ExoN activity mediates RNA-dependent RNAproofreading, high-fidelity RNA synthesis, and replication. To date, the solvedpartial RTC structures, biochemistry, and models use or assume completelyprocessed, mature nsp. Here, we demonstrate that in MHV, engineered deletion ofthe cleavage sites between nsp13-14 and nsp14-15 allowed recovery ofreplication-competent virus. Compared to wild-type (WT) MHV, the nsp13-14 andnsp14-15 cleavage deletion mutants demonstrated delayed replication kinetics,impaired genome production, altered abundance and patterns of recombination, and impaired competitive fitness. Further, the nsp13-14 and nsp14-15 mutant virusesdemonstrated mutation frequencies that were significantly higher than with theWT. The results demonstrate that cleavage of nsp13-14 or nsp14-15 is not requiredfor MHV viability and that functions of the RTC/nsp14-ExoN are impaired whenassembled with noncleaved intermediates. These data will inform future genetic,structural, biochemical, and modeling studies of coronavirus RTCs and nsp 13, 14,and 15 and may reveal new approaches for inhibition or attenuation of CoVinfection. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus replication requires proteolytic maturation of the nonstructural replicase proteins to form the replication-transcriptioncomplex. Coronavirus replication-transcription complex models assume maturesubunits; however, mechanisms of coronavirus maturation and replicase complexformation have yet to be defined. Here, we show that for the coronavirus murinehepatitis virus, cleavage between the nonstructural replicase proteins nsp13-14and nsp14-15 is not required for replication but does alter RNA synthesis andrecombination. These results shed new light on the requirements for coronavirusmaturation and replication-transcription complex assembly, and they may revealnovel therapeutic targets and strategies for attenuation.

LID - 10.1128/jvi.00758-22 [doi]
AB  - Ancestral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lacks the intrinsic ability to bind to the mouse ACE2 receptor, and therefore establishmentof SARS-CoV-2 mouse models has been limited to the use of mouse-adapted virusesor genetically modified mice. Interestingly, some of the variants of concern,such as the Beta B.1.351 variant, show an improved binding to the mouse receptor and hence better replication in different wild-type (WT) mouse species. Here, we describe the establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 Beta B.1.351 variant infection modelin male SCID mice as a tool to assess the antiviral efficacy of potentialSARS-CoV-2 small-molecule inhibitors. Intranasal infection of male SCID mice with10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the Beta B.1.351 variantresulted in high viral loads in the lungs and moderate signs of lung pathology onday 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with the antiviral drugsmolnupiravir (200 mg/kg, twice a day [BID]) or nirmatrelvir (300 mg/kg, BID) for 3 consecutive days significantly reduced the infectious virus titers in the lungsby 2 and 3.9 log10 TCID50/mg of tissue, respectively, and significantly improved lung pathology. Together, these data demonstrate the validity of this SCID mouse Beta B.1.351 variant infection model as a convenient preclinical model forassessment of potential activity of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCEUnlike the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, the Beta (B.1.351) variant of concern hasbeen reported to replicate to some extent in WT mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Wedemonstrate here that infection of SCID mice with the Beta variant resulted inhigh viral loads in the lungs on day 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir for 3 consecutive days markedly reduced theinfectious virus titers in the lungs and improved lung pathology. The SARS-CoV2SCID mouse infection model, which is ideally suited for antiviral studies, offersan advantage in comparison to other SARS-CoV2 mouse models, in that there is noneed for the use of mouse-adapted virus strains or genetically modified mice.Mouse models also have advantages over hamster models because (i) lower amountsof test drugs are needed, (ii) more animals can be housed in a cage, and (iii)reagents to analyze mouse samples are more readily available than those forhamsters.

TI  - Pandemic 1918 Influenza Virus Does Not Cause Lethal Infection in Rhesus orCynomolgus Macaques.
PG  - e0072822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00728-22 [doi]
AB  - The 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic was among the most severe in history, taking thelives of approximately 50 million people worldwide, and novel prophylacticvaccines are urgently needed to prevent another pandemic. Given that macaques arephysiologically relevant preclinical models of human immunology that haveadvanced the clinical treatment of infectious diseases, a lethal pandemicinfluenza challenge model would provide a stringent platform for testing newinfluenza vaccine concepts. To this end, we infected rhesus macaques andMauritian cynomolgus macaques with highly pathogenic 1918 H1N1 influenza virusand assessed pathogenesis and disease severity. Despite infection with a highdose of 1918 influenza delivered via multiple routes, rhesus macaquesdemonstrated minimal signs of disease, with only intermittent viral shedding.Cynomolgus macaques infected via intrabronchial instillation demonstrated mildsymptoms, with disease severity depending on the infection dose. Cynomolgusmacaques infected with a high dose of 1918 influenza delivered via multipleroutes experienced moderate disease characterized by consistent viral shedding,pulmonary infiltrates, and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. However, 1918influenza was uniformly nonlethal in these two species, demonstrating that thisisolate is insufficiently pathogenic in rhesus and Mauritian cynomolgus macaques to support testing novel prophylactic influenza approaches where protection from severe disease combined with a lethal outcome is desired as a highly stringentindication of vaccine efficacy. IMPORTANCE The world remains at risk of aninfluenza pandemic, and the development of new therapeutic and preventativemodalities is critically important for minimizing human death and sufferingduring the next influenza pandemic. Animal models are central to the development of new therapies and vaccine approaches. In particular, nonhuman primates likerhesus and cynomolgus macaques are highly relevant preclinical models given theirphysiological and immunological similarities to humans. Unfortunately, thereremains a scarcity of macaque models of pandemic influenza with which to testnovel antiviral modalities. Here, we demonstrate that even at the highest dosestested, 1918 influenza was not lethal in these two macaque species, suggestingthat they are not ideal for the development and testing of novel pandemicinfluenza-specific vaccines and therapies. Therefore, other physiologicallyrelevant nonhuman primate models of pandemic influenza are needed.

AB  - Previous studies show high agreement between MIC spectrophotometric readings and visual inspection of azoles and amphotericin B against Aspergillus fumigatusisolates. Here, we tested and compared the in vitro activity of a novelantifungal, olorofim, against Aspergillus spp., Scedosporium spp., andLomentospora prolificans by visual inspection and spectrophotometric readings.Clinical isolates of Aspergillus (n = 686) and Scedosporium (n = 36) spp. and L. prolificans (n = 13) were tested. Olorofim MICs were evaluated-following theEUCAST E.Def 9.4 procedure-by visual inspection or spectrophotometric readings(combinations of either >/=90% or >/=95% fungal growth inhibition endpointscompared to drug-free control endpoints and different wavelengths [405 nm, 450nm, 492 nm, 540 nm, and 620 nm]). We observed high in vitro activity of olorofim against all tested Aspergillus spp. (MICs up to 0.06 mg/L), except for A.calidoustus, and against L. prolificans and Scedosporium spp. (MICs up to 0.125mg/L). The combination of >/=90% fungal growth inhibition endpoints atwavelengths of >/=492 nm resulted in high essential agreements with A. fumigatus and lesser agreement with non-fumigatus Aspergillus, Scedosporium spp., and L.prolificans, although the number of isolates studied was low. This single-center study shows high agreement among olorofim MICs against A. fumigatus by visualinspection and spectrophotometric readings (>/=90% fungal growth inhibitionendpoints and wavelengths of >/=492 nm) and encouraging results againstnon-fumigatus Aspergillus spp., Scedosporium spp., and L. prolificans.

LID - 10.1128/aac.00527-22 [doi]
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria cause infectionsassociated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, a leadingregimen to treat infections caused by MBL-producing bacteria is aztreonamcombined with ceftazidime-avibactam. The purpose of the present study was toevaluate and rationally optimize the combination of aztreonam andceftazidime-avibactam with and without polymyxin B against a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate producing NDM-1 and CTX-M by use of the hollow fiber infectionmodel (HFIM). A novel de-escalation approach to polymyxin B dosing was alsoexplored, whereby a standard 0-h loading dose was followed by maintenance dosesthat were 50% of the typical clinical regimen. In the HFIM, the addition ofpolymyxin B to aztreonam plus ceftazidime-avibactam significantly improvedbacterial killing, leading to eradication, including for the novel de-escalation dosing strategy. Serial samples from the growth control and monotherapies wereexplored in a Galleria mellonella virulence model to assess virulence changes.Weibull regression showed that low-level ceftazidime resistance and treatmentwith monotherapy resulted in increased G. mellonella mortality (P < 0.05). Aneutropenic rabbit pneumonia model demonstrated that aztreonam plusceftazidime-avibactam with or without polymyxin B resulted in similar bacterialkilling, and these combination therapies were statistically significantly better than monotherapies (P < 0.05). However, only the polymyxin B-containingcombination therapy produced a statistically significant decrease in lung weights(P < 0.05), indicating a decreased inflammatory process. Altogether, addingpolymyxin B to the combination of aztreonam plus ceftazidime-avibactam for NDM-and CTX-M-producing K. pneumoniae improved bacterial killing effects, reducedlung inflammation, suppressed resistance amplification, and limited virulencechanges.

TI  - alpha2,3-Linked Sialic Acids Are the Potential Attachment Receptor for ShaanVirus Infection in MARC-145 Cells.
PG  - e0125622
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01256-22 [doi]
AB  - Shaan virus (ShaV), a novel species of the genus Jeilongvirus, familyParamyxoviridae, was isolated from an insectivore bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Korea in 2016. ShaV particles contain a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN)glycoprotein in their envelope that allows the virus to target cells. Typically, diverse paramyxoviruses with HN glycoprotein are reported to interactpredominantly with sialic acids, but there are no studies of receptors for ShaV. In this study, the identification of potential receptors for ShaV wasdemonstrated using sialidase treatments, glycan microarray, magnetic bead-basedvirus binding assay, and neuraminidase inhibitor treatments. Pretreatment ofMARC-145 cells with sialidase, which cleaves alpha2,3-linked sialic acids, showedhigher inhibition of viral infection than alpha2,6-linked-specific sialidase.These data were supported by the binding of ShaV to predominantly alpha2,3-linkedsialylated glycans in the screening of sialyl linkage patterns through glycanmicroarray. To further confirm the direct interaction between ShaV andalpha2,3-linked sialic acids, ShaV was incubated with alpha2,3- oralpha2,6-linked sialylated glycans conjugated to magnetic beads, and bindingsignals were detected only for alpha2,3-linked sialylated glycans. In addition,the potential of sialic acids as a receptor was demonstrated by the viralreplication inhibitory effect of the neuraminidase inhibitor2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminicacid (DANA) in the mature virion releasesteps. Collectively, these results support that alpha2,3-linked sialic acids are the potential receptor for ShaV infection in MARC-145 cells. IMPORTANCE Bats hostmajor mammalian paramyxoviruses, and novel paramyxoviruses are increasingly beingreported around the world. Shaan virus (ShaV), from the genus Jeilongvirus,family Paramyxoviridae, has a potential attachment glycoprotein, HN. Here, weidentify that ShaV binds to sialic acid and demonstrate that alpha2,3-linkedsialic acids are the potential receptor for ShaV infection. The presented dataregarding ShaV receptor specificity will enable studies into the viral tropismfor the host and contribute to the development of new antiviral strategiestargeting viral receptors.

TI  - Metabolism in the Niche: a Large-Scale Genome-Based Survey Reveals InositolUtilization To Be Widespread among Soil, Commensal, and Pathogenic Bacteria.
PG  - e0201322
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02013-22 [doi]
AB  - Phytate is the main phosphorus storage molecule of plants and is thereforepresent in large amounts in the environment and in the diet of humans andanimals. Its dephosphorylated form, the polyol myo-inositol (MI), can be used by bacteria as a sole carbon and energy source. The biochemistry and regulation ofMI degradation were deciphered in Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica, but a systematic survey of this catabolic pathway has been missing until now. For acomprehensive overview of the distribution of MI utilization, we analyzed 193,757bacterial genomes, representing a total of 24,812 species, for the presence,organization, and taxonomic prevalence of inositol catabolic gene clusters(IolCatGCs). The genetic capacity for MI degradation was detected in 7,384(29.8%) of all species for which genome sequences were available.IolCatGC-positive species were particularly found among Actinobacteria andProteobacteria and to a much lesser extent in Bacteroidetes. IolCatGCs are verydiverse in terms of gene number and functions, whereas the order of core genes ishighly conserved on the phylum level. We predict that 111 animal pathogens, more than 200 commensals, and 430 plant pathogens or rhizosphere bacteria utilize MI, underscoring that IolCatGCs provide a growth benefit within distinct ecologicalniches. IMPORTANCE This study reveals that the capacity to utilize inositol isunexpectedly widespread among soil, commensal, and pathogenic bacteria. We assumethat this yet-neglected metabolism plays a pivotal role in the microbial turnoverof phytate and inositols. The bioinformatic tool established here enablespredicting to which extent and genetic variance a bacterial determinant ispresent in all genomes sequenced so far.

TI  - The evolution of a counter-defense mechanism in a virus constrains its hostrange.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.79549 [doi]
LID - e79549 [pii]
AB  - Bacteria use diverse immunity mechanisms to defend themselves against their viralpredators, bacteriophages. In turn, phages can acquire counter-defense systems,but it remains unclear how such mechanisms arise and what factors constrain viralevolution. Here, we experimentally evolved T4 phage to overcome a phage-defensivetoxin-antitoxin system, toxIN, in E. coli. Through recombination, T4 rapidlyacquires segmental amplifications of a previously uncharacterized gene, now namedtifA, encoding an inhibitor of the toxin, ToxN. These amplifications subsequentlydrive large deletions elsewhere in T4's genome to maintain a genome sizecompatible with capsid packaging. The deleted regions include accessory genesthat help T4 overcome defense systems in alternative hosts. Thus, our resultsreveal a trade-off in viral evolution; the emergence of one counter-defensemechanism can lead to loss of other such mechanisms, thereby constraining hostrange. We propose that the accessory genomes of viruses reflect the integratedevolutionary history of the hosts they infected.

TI  - Investigating Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathways in Tannerella forsythia withN-Acetylmuramic Acid Bioorthogonal Probes.
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.2c00333 [doi]
AB  - The human oral microbiome is the second largest microbial community in humans,harboring over 700 bacterial species, which aid in digestion and protect fromgrowth of disease-causing pathogens. One such oral pathogen, Tannerellaforsythia, along with other species, contributes to the pathogenesis ofperiodontitis. T. forsythia is unable to produce its own N-acetylmuramic acid(NAM) sugar, essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis and therefore must scavengeNAM from other species with which it cohabitates. Here, we explore the recycling potential of T. forsythia for NAM uptake with a bioorthogonal modification intoits peptidoglycan, allowing for click-chemistry-based visualization of the cellwall structure. Additionally, we identified NAM recycling enzyme homologues in T.forsythia that are similar to the enzymes found in Pseudomonas putida. Thesehomologues were then genetically transformed into a laboratory safe Escherichiacoli strain, resulting in the efficient incorporation of unnatural NAM analogues into the peptidoglycan backbone and its visualization, alone or in the presenceof human macrophages. This strain will be useful in further studies to probe NAM recycling and peptidoglycan scavenging pathways of T. forsythia and othercohabiting bacteria.

TI  - Mucosal Immune Profiles Associated with Diarrheal Disease Severity in Shigella-and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli-Infected Children Enrolled in the GlobalEnteric Multicenter Study.
PG  - e0053822
LID - 10.1128/mbio.00538-22 [doi]
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Shigella are etiologic agents ofdiarrhea in children <5 years old living in resource-poor countries. Repeatedbouts of infection lead to lifelong morbidity and even death. The goal of thisstudy was to characterize local mucosal immune responses in Shigella- andEPEC-infected children <5 years of age with moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD)enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS). We hypothesized thatinfection with each of these pathogens would induce distinct gut mucosal immuneprofiles indicative of disease etiology and severity. To test this hypothesis,innate and adaptive immune markers were measured in stools from children withdiarrhea due to EPEC, Shigella, or other organisms and in children who had nodiarrhea. Shigella-positive diarrhea evoked robust proinflammatory and TH1/TH2cytokine responses compared to diarrhea caused by EPEC or other organisms, withthe exception of interleukin 5 (IL-5), which was associated with EPEC infection. The presence of IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-16, and tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF-beta) was associated with the absence of dysentery. EPEC-positive diarrhea evoked high levels of IL-1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and IL-10.Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) had opposing roles indisease severity, being associated with absence of diarrhea in EPEC-infectedchildren and with dysenteric Shigella infection. High levels of antigen-specific antibodies were detected in the controls and children with Shigella withoutdysentery, which suggests a protective role against severe disease. In summary,this study identified distinct local immune responses associated with twoclinically relevant diarrheagenic pathogens, Shigella and EPEC, in children andidentified protective immune phenotypes that can inform the development ofpreventive measures. IMPORTANCE Shigella and enteropathogenic Escherichia coliare primary agents of moderate to severe diarrhea in children <5 years of ageliving in resource-poor countries. Repeated bouts of illness lead to lifelonghealth impairment and even death. Aiming to understand the local host immunity tothese pathogens in relation to disease prognosis and to identify prophylaxis and therapeutic targets, we investigated innate and adaptive immune profiles instools from children infected with EPEC with and without diarrhea, Shigella with and without dysentery, and controls in well characterized clinical samplesobtained during the Global Enteric Multicenter Study. For the first time, wereport pathogen-specific mucosal immune profiles associated with severity orabsence of disease in children <5 years of age that can inform prevention andtreatment efforts.

TI  - TREM2 Promotes Immune Evasion by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Human Macrophages.
PG  - e0145622
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01456-22 [doi]
AB  - Macrophage surface receptors are critical for pathogen defense, as they are thegatekeepers for pathogen entry and sensing, which trigger robust immuneresponses. TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is atransmembrane surface receptor that mediates anti-inflammatory immune signaling. A recent study showed that TREM2 is a receptor for mycolic acids in themycobacterial cell wall and inhibits macrophage activation. However, theunderlying functional mechanism of how TREM2 regulates the macrophageantimycobacterial response remains unclear. Here, we show that Mycobacteriumtuberculosis, the causative agent for tuberculosis, specifically binds to humanTREM2 to disable the macrophage antibacterial response. Live but not killedmycobacteria specifically trigger the upregulation of TREM2 during macrophageinfection through a mechanism dependent on STING (the stimulator of interferongenes). TREM2 facilitated uptake of M. tuberculosis into macrophages and isresponsible for blocking the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and reactive oxygen species (ROS),while enhancing the production of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and IL-10.TREM2-mediated blockade of ROS production promoted the survival of M.tuberculosis within infected macrophages. Consistent with this, genetic deletion or antibody-mediated neutralization of TREM2 reduced the intracellular survivalof M. tuberculosis through enhanced production of ROS. Importantly, inhibition oftype I IFN signaling in TREM2-overexpressing macrophages restored the ability of these cells to produce inflammatory cytokines and ROS, resulting in normal levelsof intracellular bacteria killing. Collectively, our study identifies TREM2 as anattractive host receptor for host-directed antimycobacterial therapeutics.IMPORTANCE Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most ancient bacterialpathogens and remains the leading cause of death from a single bacterial agent.The success of M. tuberculosis relies greatly on its ability to parasitize anddisable its host macrophages. Previous studies have found that M. tuberculosisuses its unique cell wall lipids to manipulate the immune response by binding to specific surface receptors on macrophages. Our study reveals that M. tuberculosisbinds to TREM2, an immunomodulatory receptor expressed on macrophages, tofacilitate a "silent" mode of entry. Increased levels of TREM2 triggered byintracellular sensing of M. tuberculosis promoted the intracellular survival ofM. tuberculosis through type I IFN-driven inhibition of reactive oxygen species(ROS) and proinflammatory cytokine production. Importantly, deletion of TREM2reversed the effects of "silent" entry and resulted in increased production ofinflammatory cytokines, generation of ROS, and cell death. As such,antibody-mediated or pharmacological targeting of TREM2 could be a promisingstrategy for novel treatments against M. tuberculosis infection.

TI  - A Salvaging Strategy Enables Stable Metabolite Provisioning among Free-LivingBacteria.
PG  - e0028822
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00288-22 [doi]
AB  - All organisms rely on complex metabolites such as amino acids, nucleotides, andcofactors for essential metabolic processes. Some microbes synthesize thesefundamental ingredients of life de novo, while others rely on uptake to fulfilltheir metabolic needs. Although certain metabolic processes are inherently"leaky," the mechanisms enabling stable metabolite provisioning among microbes inthe absence of a host remain largely unclear. In particular, how can metaboliteprovisioning among free-living bacteria be maintained under the evolutionarypressure to economize resources? Salvaging, the process of "recycling andreusing," can be a metabolically efficient route to obtain access to requiredresources. Here, we show experimentally how precursor salvaging in engineeredEscherichia coli populations can lead to stable, long-term metaboliteprovisioning. We find that salvaged cobamides (vitamin B12 and related enzymecofactors) are readily made available to nonproducing population members, yetsalvagers are strongly protected from overexploitation. We also describe apreviously unnoted benefit of precursor salvaging, namely, the removal of thenonfunctional, proliferation-inhibiting precursor. As long as compatibleprecursors are present, any microbe possessing the terminal steps of abiosynthetic process can, in principle, forgo de novo biosynthesis in favor ofsalvaging. Consequently, precursor salvaging likely represents a potent, yetoverlooked, alternative to de novo biosynthesis for the acquisition andprovisioning of metabolites in free-living bacterial populations. IMPORTANCERecycling gives new life to old things. Bacteria have the ability to recycle and reuse complex molecules they encounter in their environment to fulfill theirbasic metabolic needs in a resource-efficient way. By studying the salvaging(recycling and reusing) of vitamin B12 precursors, we found that metabolitesalvaging can benefit others and provide stability to a bacterial community atthe same time. Salvagers of vitamin B12 precursors freely share the result oftheir labor yet cannot be outcompeted by freeloaders, likely because salvagersretain preferential access to the salvaging products. Thus, salvaging mayrepresent an effective, yet overlooked, mechanism of acquiring and provisioningnutrients in microbial populations.

TI  - Detection and Quantification of the Capsular Polysaccharide of Burkholderiapseudomallei in Serum and Urine Samples from Melioidosis Patients.
PG  - e0076522
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00765-22 [doi]
AB  - Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, alife-threatening disease common in Southeast Asia and northern Australia.Melioidosis often presents with nonspecific symptoms and has a fatality rate ofupwards of 70% when left untreated. The gold standard for diagnosis is culturing B. pseudomallei from patient samples. Bacterial culture, however, can take up to 7 days, and its sensitivity is poor, at roughly 60%. The successfuladministration of appropriate antibiotics is reliant on rapid and accuratediagnosis. Hence, there is a genuine need for new diagnostics for this deadlypathogen. The Active Melioidosis Detect (AMD) lateral flow immunoassay (LFI)detects the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of B. pseudomallei. The assay isdesigned for use on various clinical samples, including serum and urine; however,there are limited data to support which clinical matrices are the best candidatesfor detecting CPS. In this study, concentrations of CPS in paired serum and urinesamples from melioidosis patients were determined using a quantitative antigencapture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In parallel, samples were tested with the AMD LFI, and the results of the two immunoassays were compared. Additionally,centrifugal concentration was performed on a subset of urine samples to determineif this method may improve detection when CPS levels are initially low orundetectable. The results indicate that while CPS levels varied within the twomatrices, there tended to be higher concentrations in urine. The AMD LFI detectedCPS in 40.5% of urine samples, compared to 6.5% of serum samples, suggesting thaturine is a preferable matrix for point-of-care diagnostic assays. IMPORTANCEMelioidosis is very challenging to diagnose. There is a clear need for apoint-of-care assay for the detection of B. pseudomallei antigen directly frompatient samples. The Active Melioidosis Detect lateral flow immunoassay detectsthe capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of B. pseudomallei and is designed for use onvarious clinical samples, including serum and urine. However, there are limiteddata regarding which clinical matrix is preferable for the detection of CPS. Thisstudy addresses this question by examining quantitative CPS levels in pairedserum and urine samples and relating them to clinical parameters. Additionally,centrifugal concentration was performed on a subset of urine samples to determinewhether this might enable the detection of CPS in samples in which it wasinitially present at low or undetectable levels. These results provide valuableinsights into the detection of CPS in patients with melioidosis and suggestpotential ways forward in the diagnosis and treatment of this challengingdisease.

TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae Rapidly Translocate from the Nasopharynx through theCribriform Plate to Invade the Outer Meninges.
PG  - e0102422
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01024-22 [doi]
AB  - The entry routes and translocation mechanisms of microorganisms or particulatematerials into the central nervous system remain obscure We report here thatStreptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), or polystyrene microspheres of similarsize, appear in the meninges of the dorsal cortex of mice within minutes ofinhaled delivery. Recovery of viable bacteria from dissected tissue andfluorescence microscopy show that up to at least 72 h, pneumococci andmicrospheres were predominantly found in the outer of the two meninges: thepachymeninx. No pneumococci were found in blood or cerebrospinal fluid.Intravital imaging through the skull, aligned with flow cytometry showedrecruitment and activation of LysM(+) cells in the dorsal pachymeninx at 5 and 10hours following intranasal infection. Imaging of the cribriform plate suggestedthat both pneumococci and microspheres entered through the foramina via an inwardflow of fluid connecting the nose to the pachymeninx. Our findings bring newinsight into the varied mechanisms of pneumococcal invasion of the centralnervous system, but they are also pertinent to the delivery of drugs to the brainand the entry of airborne particulate matter into the cranium. IMPORTANCE Usingtwo-photon imaging, we show that pneumococci translocate from the nasopharynx to the dorsal meninges of a mouse in the absence of any bacteria found in blood orcerebrospinal fluid. Strikingly, this takes place within minutes of inhaleddelivery of pneumococci, suggesting the existence of an inward flow of fluidconnecting the nasopharynx to the meninges, rather than a receptor-mediatedmechanism. We also show that this process is size dependent, as microspheres ofthe same size as pneumococci can translocate along the same pathway, while largersize microspheres cannot. Furthermore, we describe the host response to invasion of the outer meninges. Our study provides a completely new insight into the keyinitial events that occur during the translocation of pneumococci directly fromthe nasal cavity to the meninges, with relevance to the development of intranasaldrug delivery systems and the investigations of brain damage caused by inhaledair pollutants.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has become a global pandemic sinceDecember 2019. Most of the patients are mild or asymptomatic and recovered wellas those suffered from other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection issupposed to demonstrate more sequelae. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among COVID-19 patients and is associated with disease severity and outcomes. Only afew studies focused on a detailed analysis of kidney damage in asymptomatic ormildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Whether any minor viral infection is likelyto exhibit similar minor effect on renal function as COVID-19 is still unclear,and the definite pathophysiology of viral invasion is not fully understood.Currently, the proposed mechanisms of AKI include direct effects of virus onkidney, dysregulated immune response, or as a result of multi-organs failure havebeen proposed. This study will discuss the difference between COVID-19 and other viruses, focusing on proposed mechanisms, biomarkers and whether it matters with clinical significance.

LID - 10.17392/1500-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To evaluate clinical and epidemiological characteristics and outcome ofpatients with COVID-19, and impact of vaccine against COVID-19 on them. MethodsThis retrospective study included 225 patients treated from COVID-19 in theperiod from 1 to 30 September 2021 at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases,University Clinical Centre Tuzla (UCC Tuzla). For the diagnosis confirmation ofCovid-19, RTPCR was used. Patients were divided in two groups: fully vaccinatedwith two doses of vaccine, and non-vaccinated or partially vaccinated. Results Of225 patients, 120 (53.3%) were females, and 105 (46.7%) males. Mean age was 65.6 years. There were 26 (11.6%) fully vaccinated patients. Most common symptoms inunvaccinated patients were fatigue (70.9%), cough (70.4%) and fever (69.8%), and in vaccinated fever (76.9%), fatigue (69.2%) and cough (46.2%). Cough was morecommon in unvaccinated patients (p=0.013). Fatal outcome happened in 84 (37.3%)patients. Transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and older age had a higherrisk of death (p<0.001). Older age patients were more likely to havecomorbidities like atrial fibrillation (p=0.017), hypertension (p<001) anddiabetes mellitus (p=0.002). Atrial fibrillation (p<0.001), hypertension(p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.009) and history of stroke (p=0.026), wererelated to fatal outcome in unvaccinated patients, also did a shorter duration ofillness prior to hospitalization (p<0.001) and shorter length of hospitalization (p=0.002). Conclusion Older patients with comorbidities, as well as those whowere not vaccinated against COVID-19, were at higher risk for severe form of the disease and poor outcome.

TI  - Calcicoptosis induced by purple sweet potato anthocyanins through the nonosmotic regulation of the NFAT5/S100A4-S100A9 pathway in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202200447 [doi]
AB  - Purple sweet potato is considered an abundant, inexpensive, and ideal source ofanthocyanins. Purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPAs) have been shown to possesshigh antimutagenicity and antitumor effects due to the abundance of acylatedanthocyanins. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of PSPA effects inacute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially T-cell acute lymphoblasticleukemia (T-ALL), remain unclear. In this study, the antileukemic effects ofPSPAs and the underlying molecular mechanisms were evaluated by in vitro and insilico assays. PSPAs extracted from ten cultivars were analyzed and quantified.Anthocyanins from Nanzi 018, which showed the best antileukemic effect, wereselected to analyze the underlying mechanism. First, the PSPAs potently reducedcell viability and induced apoptosis. Additionally, the PSPAs sharply increasedintracellular Ca 2+ levels, which resulted in calcium overload in T-ALL cells.Furthermore, on the basis of bioinformatics analyses, we focused on anosmotically regulated transcription factor, NFAT5. Molecular dockingpreliminarily indicated that PSPA molecules bound and interacted with the NFAT5protein. Western blot analyses confirmed that PSPAs elicited calcium overload by nonosmotic regulation of NFAT5/S100A4-S100A9 pathway activation. Moreover,pretreatment with a NFAT5 inducer confirmed that PSPAs targeted NFAT5 andaffected p38/NF-kappaB/Bcl-2/Caspase-3 axis activation. This study demonstratesthat PSPAs exert their antileukemic effects through calcicoptosis induction bytargeting NFAT5.

TI  - Plastic structures for diverse substrates: a revisit of human ABC transporters.
LID - 10.1002/prot.26406 [doi]
AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is one of the largest groups of primaryactive transporters that could be found in all kingdoms of life from bacteria to humans. In human, ABC transporters can selectively transport a wide spectrum ofsubstrates across membranes, thus playing a pivotal role in multiplephysiological processes. In addition, due to the ability of exporting clinictherapeuticals, some ABC transporters were originally termed multidrug resistanceproteins. Increasing investigations of human ABC transporters in recent yearshave provided abundant information for elucidating their structural features,based on the structures at distinct states in a transport cycle. This reviewfocuses on the recent progresses in human ABC structural analyses, substratebinding specificities and translocation mechanisms. We dedicate to summarize the common features of human ABC transporters in different subfamilies, and todiscuss the possibility to apply the fast-developing techniques, such ascryogenic electron microscopy, artificial intelligence-assisted structureprediction, for future studies.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) andvancomycin-intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) are among theWHO's high priority pathogens. Among these two, MRSA is the most globallydocumented pathogen that necessitates the pressing demand for new classes ofanti-MRSA drugs. Bacterial gyrase targeted therapeutics are unique strategies to overcome cross-resistance as they are present only in bacteria and absent inhigher eukaryotes. The GyrB subunit is essential for the catalytic functions ofthe bacterial enzyme DNA Gyrase, thereby constituting a promising druggabletarget. The current study performed a structure-based virtual screening todesigning GyrB target-specific candidate molecules. The de novo ligand design of novel hit molecules was performed using a rhodanine scaffold. Through asystematic in silico screening process, the hit molecules were screened for theirsynthetic accessibility, drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics properties inaddition to its target specific interactions. Of the 374 hit molecules obtainedthrough de novo ligand design, qsl-304 emerged as the most promising ligand. The molecular dynamic simulation studies confirmed the stable interaction between thekey residues and qsl-304. qsl-304 was synthesized through a one-step chemicalsynthesis procedure, and the in vitro activity was proven, with an IC50 of 31.23 microg/mL against the novobiocin resistant clinical isolate, Staphylococcusaureus sa-P2003. Further studies on time-kill kinetics showed the bacteriostatic nature with the diminished recurrence of resistance. The on-target gyrBinhibition further proved the efficacy of qsl-304.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.Sarma.

AB  - One of the most important requirements for the personnel of microbiologicallaboratories working with pathogenic and infectious agents is the observance ofprecautionary measures and the implementation of a set of preventive measures,collectively interpreted as biological safety (biosafety). To a large extent,biosafety problems are also relevant for all clinical laboratories working withbiosubstrates, with the potential threat of containing pathogens of bloodborneinfections in them. On December 30, 2020, the President of the Russian Federationsigned Federal Law numero sign 492 <<On the Biological Safety of the RussianFederation>> (numero sign 492-FZ), which regulates the basic legal norms andregulation of biosafety issues, as well as a list of measures to prevent therisks of the spread of infections due to accidents, bioterrorist acts andsabotage. The current pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 hasdemonstrated, on the one hand, the epidemiological vulnerability of the singleworld space, and on the other hand, the decisive influence of biologicalemergencies on the emergence of negative political and economic processes in the world community. In this regard, the issues of ensuring biosafety in the work of microbiological laboratories in the context of protecting personnel and theenvironment from accidental or unintentional spread of infections are relevant.Working with pathogenic biological agents in microbiological laboratories isconstantly associated with the risk of accidents and possible laboratoryinfection (laboratory-acquired infections) of employees, environmental pollution if the requirements of regulatory documents on biological safety are not met. In accordance with the requirements of numero sign 492-FZ, in order to preventbiological threats, it is necessary to create a system for monitoring biological risks in microbiological laboratories when working with any infected material.

AB  - The development of mycotic colonization of the base surface with furtherbiodegradation of acrylic plastics is currently of undoubted interest. The oralcavity is a favorable ecological niche for colonization by fungi and theirsubsequent possible invasion into the epithelium of the oral mucosa. The methodof modulation interference laser microscopy is of considerable interest toresearchers in medicine in the context of obtaining the necessary informationabout the morphological characteristics of microbial cells and the microbiomecommunity as a whole during the colonization of a certain ecological niche in thehuman body. Purpose of the study: to analyze the microrelief of the biofilm ofyeast-like fungi of the species Candida albicans of base plastics of the hot typeof polymerization using the method of laser modulation interference microscopy.An experimental study was carried out in order to study biofilms of yeast-likefungi of the genus Candida on samples of basic plastics, an image of a biofilm ofyeast-like fungi of the species Candida albicans was obtained on the surface of aplastic of a hot type of polymerization (polymethyl methacrylate) in thevisualization of the phase portrait, a description of its horizontal and verticalbioprofile. As a result of the research, the heterogeneous structure of thebiofilm was determined, due to the different density and accumulation of cellsalong the surface, the characteristics of the surface were established inaccordance with the roughness criteria. The microrelief parameters on aseparately arbitrarily selected section line allow one to determine thecharacteristics of the biofilm in the required area and make it possible to judgethe nature of its formation in a certain biological niche.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the main Candida species isolated fromblood of cancer patients, to compare the taxonomic structure of strains obtained from children and adults with candidemia. In total, during the study period,candidemia was microbiologically proven by blood culture in 81 patients(duplicates were excluded). Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) accountedfor 35,8%. The total number of isolates elaborated was 82 strains of 10 Candidaspecies. In general, in the taxonomic structure of candidemias, C. parapsilosis(61.0%) predominates, C. albicans (20.7%) is in the second place, followed by C. glabrata and C. lusitaniae (3.7% each); C. krusei, C. guilliermondii and C.tropicalis (2.4% each). C. parapsilosis was statistically significantly oftenisolated from blood compared to C. albicans (61.0% versus 20.7%, respectively,p<0.0001). Candidemia was statistically significantly more often detected inadults than in children (63.0% versus 37.0%, respectively, p<0.002). Moreover, inadults, C. parapsilosis was statistically significantly more often isolated from blood than C. albicans (70.6% versus 15.7%, respectively, p<0.0001). In children,there were no significant differences in the frequency of isolation of C.parapsilosis and C. albicans: the proportion of C. parapsilosis was 45.2%, C.albicans - 29.0%. Rare species were identified in 7.8% of cases in adults, and in12.9% of cases in children without statistical difference (p>0.05). Theproportion of Candida non-albicans during the study period was 79.3%, and C.parapsilosis is the main species in this group (76.9%).

AB  - Cerclage wiring may be used for fracture fixation or osteotomy stabilization inrevision arthroplasty. There is a lack of evidence regarding the potential riskof bacterial colonization for the different types of cerclages. The objective of our research is to study the adhesion and biofilm formation of S. epidermidis, S.aureus, and P. aeruginosa on two different cerclage cable models, comparing apolymer cable and a stainless steel metal cable. A two-cm cerclage piece of each material was submerged in 2 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) inoculated with 10 muL of a 0.5 McFarland bacterial culture, and incubated at 37 degrees C during 2 hfor adhesion and 48 h for biofilm formation. The cerclages were washed with 1xPBSand sonicated in a new culture medium. Aliquots of several dilutions of eachsonicated culture were spread in TSB agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h.The number of colonies was counted. The colony-forming units per ml (CFU/mL) and the percentage of reduction were calculated. Experiments were triplicated. For P.aeruginosa, a statistically significant reduction in biofilm formation was found on the polymer cerclage cable, compared to the metal cerclage cable. Reductionsof 59% and 88%, after 2 h and 48 h, respectively, were observed. For S. epidermisand S. aureus, there was a trend towards lower bacterial adhesion and biofilmformation for the polymer cerclage cable. In summary, these results demonstratethat the braided polymer cerclage cable may be less prone to bacterial adherence and biofilm formation compared to the braided metal cerclage cable.

TI  - Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria forModulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis.
PG  - e2204650
LID - 10.1002/adma.202204650 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategiesto alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormalexpansion of E. coli during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteriaoccupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, wedevelop a bionic regulator (CaWO4 @YCW) to efficiently and precisely regulate thegut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of E. coliduring colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of E. coli strains to the mannose-rich yeast cell wall (YCW), we chose YCW as the bionicshell to encapsulate CaWO4 . We demonstrate that the YCW shell endows CaWO4 with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract andadheres to the abnormally expanded E. coli in colitis, specifically as apositioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis sitetriggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO4 , thusinhibiting E. coli growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth.Consequently, CaWO4 @YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gutmicrobiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resultingin an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS-induced colitis.

TI  - Knowledge and practice of dentists in processing polishing points: Across-sectional study.
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12951 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequately processing polishing points used to polish composite resinrestorations is necessary for microbiological control in dentistry, but there is no specific protocol to guide professionals. Therefore, this study aimed toassess the knowledge and practice of dentists in processing these instruments.METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study included the application of an online questionnaire via Google Forms and social media promotion. The studyevaluated the association of field of activity, time since graduation, age, andsex of professionals with processing practice. The statistical analysis wasperformed with absolute and relative frequencies and logistic and Poissonregressions at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Overall, 473 questionnaires wereanalyzed. A rate of 51% of professionals reported using inadequate processingmethods, and almost 68% claimed to have good knowledge of the topic. Bothregression analyses were significantly associated, showing a direct effect of ageand time since graduation on adequate processing practices. CONCLUSIONS: Althoughmost professionals reported understanding the processing of polishing points,they do not perform it most adequately. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: An expressivenumber of dentists process polishing points improperly. The topic is significant for representing a semi-critical instrument extensively used in estheticrestorations.

AB  - Bacteria biofilm formation and its complications are of special concern inisolated structures, such as offshore stations, manned submarines and spacehabitats, as maintenance and technical support are poorly accessible due to costsand/or logistical challenges. In addition, considering that future explorationmissions are planned to adventure farther and longer in space, unlocking biofilm formation mechanisms and developing new antifouling solutions are key goals inorder to ensure spacecraft's efficiency, crew's safety and mission success. Inthis work, we explored the interactions between Cupriavidus metallidurans, aprevalently identified contaminant onboard the International Space Station, andaerospace grade materials such as the titanium alloy TiAl6V4, the stainless steelAISI 316 (SS316) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or Teflon. Borosilicate glasswas used as a control and all surfaces were investigated at two different pHvalues (5.0 and 7.0). Biofilms were almost absent on stainless steel and thetitanium alloy contrary to Teflon and glass that were covered by an extensivebiofilm formed via monolayers of scattered matrix-free cells and complexmultilayered clusters or communities. Filamentous extracellular DNA structureswere observed specifically in the complex multilayered clusters adherent toTeflon, indicating that the employed attachment machinery might depend on thephysicochemical characteristics of the surface.

TI  - Pre-dialysis levels of inflammation and endotoxin in people receivinghemodialysis are not associated with blood pressure variability.
LID - 10.5414/CN110656 [doi]
AB  - There are multiple risk factors for inflammation in dialysis. One potential causeis the presence of circulating levels of Gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxinwhich is a strong inducer of inflammation. Gut-associated endotoxin may enter thecirculation via a defective blood-gut barrier during episodes of hypotension orreduced perfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 165 patients receivingoutpatient-based hemodialysis in a facility (FHD) or at home (HHD), were studied.Levels of inflammation were quantified by developing an inflammatory scorederived from the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, high-sensitivityC-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) andinterleukin 6 (IL-6). Intradialytic blood pressure (BP) variability andhypotension events were recorded. This included the final session of dialysis, atthe commencement of which the blood samples were drawn, as well as the fivepreceding sessions. RESULTS: The median inflammatory score was 2 (range 0 - 3),and 30% of patients had an inflammatory score of three suggesting significantlevels of inflammation. Only 8.5% had an inflammatory score of 0. Endotoxin wasmeasured in all participants and was only positive in N = 3. The mean systolicblood pressure (SBP) was 134 +/- 20 mmHg and the BP variability was 11.7 +/- 3.5.In a multivariable ordinal regression model, a higher inflammatory score wassignificantly associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.95 - 0.99, p =0.03), higher ultrafiltration volume (OR 1.62, CI 1.04 - 2.54, p = 0.03) andlower body mass index (OR 0.9, CI 0.86 - 0.96, p = 0.01). There was noassociation between inflammatory score and dialysis modality, access type, kidneyreplacement therapy (KRT), BP variability, or endotoxin. Endotoxin was detectedin only 3 of 165 patients and was not associated with inflammation. CONCLUSION:Pre-dialysis levels of inflammation are prevalent in the hemodialysis population after the long break but are not related to intradialytic BP variability orhypotension in the preceding 2 weeks. However, endotoxemia is uncommon andunlikely to be a significant driver of inflammation.

TI  - Model-informed Rationale for Early Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Colistin inCritically Ill Patients.
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2130 [doi]
AB  - Adequate colistin exposure is important for microbiological clearance. This studywas performed in critically ill patients >18 years old, to develop a simplifiednon-parametric pharmacokinetic (PK) model of colistin for routine clinical useand to determine the role of dose optimization. The Non-Parametric Adaptive Grid algorithm within the Pmetrics(TM) software package for R was used to develop PKmodel from 47 patients and external validation of the final model was performedin 13 patients. A one compartment multiplicative gamma error model with zeroorder input and first order elimination of colistin was developed with creatinineclearance and serum albumin as covariates on elimination rate constant. An R(2)for observed vs individual predicted colistin concentrations of 0.92 was obtainedin the validation cohort. High inter-individual variability in colistin steadystate AUC120-144 (CV = 80.1%) and a high inter-occasion variability (median CV%of AUC8h predicted every 8h for initial 96 hours after starting colistin = 23.8) was predicted in patients who received this antibiotic for a period of over 152hours (n = 22). With the model suggested dose regimen, only 20% of simulatedprofiles achieved AUC0-24 in the range of 50 - 60 mg.h/L due to high variability in population pharmacokinetics. In these group of patients, steady state colistinconcentrations were predicted to be achieved after 96 hours post initiation ofcolistimethate sodium (CMS). This study advocates the need for early and repeatedTherapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) and dose optimization, in critically illpatients, to achieve adequate therapeutic concentration of colistin.

AB  - Detailed information on specific species of non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) hasbecome a necessity for effective udder health control programs in South Africa.The main objective of this preliminary study was to identify the different NASspecies and strains present in dairy herds in South Africa using a cost-effectivemethod. A further objective was to investigate the effects of cow risk factorsand farming systems on the NAS isolates identified. A total of 214 NAS, isolated from milk collected from 17 South African dairy herds, were identified usingthree diagnostic tests (API Staph test, MALDI-TOF and 16s rRNA). There was a goodobserved agreement between the MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA sequencing (92.2%) and apoor observed agreement between the MALDI-TOF and API Staph (25.7%). The genetic relatedness within species was investigated in 128 of these isolates using randompolymorphic amplified deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (RAPD), verified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and phylogenetic analysis and cow risk factors wereinvestigated on species level. The main NAS species isolated were Staphylococcus chromogenes (75.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.4%) and Staphylococcushaemolyticus (8.9%). The RAPD test identified 34 Staphylococcus chromogenes, 13Staphylococcus epidermidis and nine Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains,indicating genetic diversity amongst strains and herds. The presence of NASintramammary infections was found to be significantly related to the farmingsystems, composite cow milk somatic cell count (SCC), parity and days in milk(DIM). Significantly more NAS were isolated from primiparous and from older cows.This knowledge could assist with the management of NAS on dairy farms.

PG  - 306-312
LID - 10.1107/S2053230X22007555 [doi]
AB  - Elizabethkingia bacteria are globally emerging pathogens that cause opportunisticand nosocomial infections, with up to 40% mortality among the immunocompromised. Elizabethkingia species are in the pipeline of organisms for high-throughputstructural analysis at the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for InfectiousDisease (SSGCID). These efforts include the structure-function analysis ofpotential therapeutic targets. Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) is essential for tRNA aminoacylation and is under investigation as a bacterial drug target. TheSSGCID produced, crystallized and determined high-resolution structures of GluRS from E. meningosepticum (EmGluRS) and E. anopheles (EaGluRS). EmGluRS wasco-crystallized with glutamate, while EaGluRS is an apo structure. EmGluRS sharesapproximately 97% sequence identity with EaGluRS but less than 39% sequenceidentity with any other structure in the Protein Data Bank. EmGluRS and EaGluRShave the prototypical bacterial GluRS topology. EmGluRS and EaGluRS have similar binding sites and tertiary structures to other bacterial GluRSs that arepromising drug targets. These structural similarities can be exploited for drugdiscovery.

AB  - Levansucrases are biotechnologically interesting fructosyltransferases due totheir potential use in the enzymatic or chemo-enzymatic synthesis of glycosidesof non-natural substrates relevant to pharmaceutical applications. The structure of Erwinia tasmaniensis levansucrase in complex with (S)-1,2,4-butanetriol andits biochemical characterization suggests the possible application of shortaliphatic moieties containing polyols with defined stereocentres infructosylation biotechnology. The structural information revealed that(S)-1,2,4-butanetriol mimics the natural substrate. The preference of the proteintowards a specific 1,2,4-butanetriol enantiomer was assessed using microscalethermophoresis binding assays. Furthermore, the results obtained and thestructural comparison of levansucrases and inulosucrases suggest that thefructose binding modes could differ in fructosyltransferases from Gram-positiveand Gram-negative bacteria.

TI  - Phytochemical compound PB125 attenuates skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunctionand impaired proteostasis in a model of musculoskeletal decline.
LID - 10.1113/JP282273 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Aside from exercise, there are no effective interventions formusculoskeletal decline, which begins in the fifth decade of life and contributesto disability and cardiometabolic diseases. Targeting both mitochondrialdysfunction and impaired protein homeostasis (proteostasis), which contribute to the age and disease process, may mitigate the progressive decline in overallmusculoskeletal function (e.g. gait, strength). A potential intervention totarget disease drivers is to stimulate Nrf2 activation, which leads to thetranscription of genes responsible for redox homeostasis, proteome maintenance,and mitochondrial energetics. Here, we tested a purported phytochemical Nrf2activator, PB125, to improve mitochondrial function and proteostasis in male and female Hartley guinea pigs, which are a model for musculoskeletal aging. PB125improved mitochondrial respiration and attenuated disease- and age-relateddeclines in skeletal muscle protein synthesis, a component of proteostasis, inboth male and female Hartley guinea pigs. ABSTRACT: Impaired mitochondrialfunction and disrupted proteostasis contribute to musculoskeletal dysfunction.However, few interventions simultaneously target these two drivers to preventmusculoskeletal decline. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)activates a transcriptional program promoting cytoprotection, metabolism, andproteostasis. We hypothesized daily treatment with a purported Nrf2 activator,PB125, in Hartley guinea pigs, a model of musculoskeletal decline, wouldattenuate the progression of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction andimpaired proteostasis and preserve musculoskeletal function. We treated 2-month- and 5-month-old male and female Hartley guinea pigs for 3 and 10 months,respectively, with the phytochemical compound PB125. Longitudinal assessments of voluntary mobility were measured using Any-Maze(TM) open-field enclosuremonitoring. Cumulative skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates were measuredusing deuterium oxide over the final 30 days of treatment. Mitochondrial oxygenconsumption in soleus muscles was measured using high resolution respirometry. Inboth sexes, PB125 1) increased electron transfer system capacity; 2) attenuatedthe disease/age-related decline in coupled and uncoupled mitochondrialrespiration; and 3) attenuated declines in protein synthesis in the myofibrillar,mitochondrial, and cytosolic subfractions of the soleus. These effects were notassociated with statistically significant prolonged maintenance of voluntarymobility in guinea pigs. Collectively, treatment with PB125 contributed tomaintenance of skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and proteostasis in apre-clinical model of musculoskeletal decline. Further investigation is necessaryto determine if these documented effects of PB125 are also accompanied by slowed progression of other aspects of musculoskeletal dysfunction. Abstract figurelegend Musculoskeletal decline is an age-related multifactorial syndrome that is characterized by joint degeneration and loss of skeletal muscle function.Mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired protein turnover are two causative factorsof musculoskeletal decline. 10 months of daily oral PB125 supplementationattenuated disease-related declines in mitochondrial respiration and proteinsynthesis in both male and female Hartley guinea pigs, which are a preclinicalmodel of spontaneous and progressive musculoskeletal decline. Despite theattenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired protein turnover, there wasnot a statistically significant effect on the maintenance of mobility over the10-month trial.

TI  - Predictors of Septic Shock or Bacteremia in Children Experiencing FebrileNeutropenia Post-Chemotherapy.
LID - piac080 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jpids/piac080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an early indicator of infection inoncology patients post-chemotherapy. We aimed to determine clinical predictors ofseptic shock and/or bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients experiencing FN andto create a model that classifies patients as low-risk for these outcomes.METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis with clinical data of a cohort ofpediatric oncology patients admitted during July 2015 to September 2017 with FN. One FN episode per patient was randomly selected. Statistical analyses includedistribution analysis, hypothesis testing, and multivariate logistic regressionto determine clinical feature association with outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 865 episodes of FN occurred in 429 subjects. In the 404 sampled episodes that wereanalyzed, 20.8% experienced outcomes of septic shock and/or bacteremia.Gram-negative bacteria count for 70% of bacteremias. Features with statistically significant influence in predicting these outcomes were hematological malignancy (P < .001), cancer relapse (P = .011), platelet count (P = .004), and age (P =.023). The multivariate logistic regression model achieves AUROC = 0.66 (95% CI0.56-0.76). The optimal classification threshold achieves sensitivity = 0.96,specificity = 0.33, PPV = 0.40, and NPV = 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: This model, based onsimple clinical variables, can be used to identify patients at low-risk of septicshock and/or bacteremia. The model's NPV of 95% satisfies the priority to avoiddischarging patients at high-risk for adverse infection outcomes. The model will require further validation on a prospective population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive role of dynamic changes of plasmabiomarkers in patients with viral and mycoplasma community-acquired pneumonia(CAP). METHODS: From January 2020 to June 2020, 141 patients with viral andmycoplasma CAP in People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region wereenrolled. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores [grade I-II (PSI score </= 70),grade III (PSI score 71-90) and grade IV-V (PSI score >/= 91)], serum amyloid A(SAA), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), procalcitonin (PCT),erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and white blood cell (WBC) on the 1 dayafter admission were compared between the different pathogens (viral andmycoplasma) or different disease severity. The change in level of SAA, hs-CRP on the third day (Delta3 d = 1 d-3 d) were compared among different disease outcome groups (patients were divided into improved group, stable group and exacerbation group based on PSI scores or lung CT images on the third day). The change in the level of SAA, hs-CRP on the seventh day (Delta7 d = 1 d-7 d) were compared among different disease prognosis groups (patients were divided into survival group anddeath group based on 28-day survival data). The receiver operating characteristiccurve (ROC) were drawn to evaluate the value of SAA in the evaluation of disease and prediction prognosis. RESULTS: The level of SAA in mycoplasma group (43cases) was significantly higher than that in virus group (98 cases) on the 1 day after admission. There were no significant differences in other plasma biomarkersbetween the two groups. The more severe the illness, the higher the SAA level on the 1 day after admission. The trends of other plasma biomarkers in the twogroups were consistent with SAA. The levels of SAA in the patients withexacerbation of the virus group and mycoplasma group (12 cases, 9 cases) weresignificantly higher than those of the improved group (57 cases, 26 cases) andthe stable group (29 cases, 8 cases). SAA increased gradually in the exacerbationgroup, decreased gradually in the improved group, and slightly increased in thestable group. DeltaSAA3 d were differences among three groups. The change trendof hs-CPR was consistent with SAA. The level of SAA in the death group was higherthan that in the survival group on the seventh day. SAA increased in the deathgroup and decreased in survival group with time from hospital admission. Therewere differences according to DeltaSAA7 d between death group and survival group.The change trend of hs-CPR was consistent with SAA. ROC curve showed that thevalue of SAA was better than hs-CRP in assessing the severity of patients onadmission day, and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was respectively 0.777 [95%confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.669-0.886], 0.729 (95%CI was 0.628-0.830). The value of DeltaSAA3 d was better than SAA on the third day predicting diseasetrends, and AUC was respectively 0.979 (95%CI was 0.921-1.000), 0.850 (95%CI was 0.660-1.000). hs-CRP on the third day and Deltahs-CRP3 d had no predictive value.Both SAA on the seventh day and DeltaSAA7 d have predictive value for prognosis. AUC was respectively 0.954 (95%CI was 0.898-0.993) and 0.890 (95%CI was0.689-1.000). SAA on the seventh day and DeltaSAA7 d were better than hs-CRP onthe seventh day. Deltahs-CRP7 d have no predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: SAA is asensitive and valuable indicator for CAP patients with viruses and mycoplasma.Dynamic monitoring of SAA can evaluate the patient's progression, prognosis, and assist diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationshipbetween lung involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and antibody levels of COVID-19 patients 3and 6 months from the disease. Methods: A total of 156 participants were divided into two groups, Group 1: lung involvement (LI)-positive and Group 2:LI-negative. Biochemical parameters and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were measured. Results: The results showed that mean levels of urea, LDH, CRP,ferritin, neutrophil count and D-dimer were significantly higher in theLI-positive group. In addition, mean antibody levels in the 3rd and 6th monthswere higher in the LI-positive group (p < 0.005). Discussion: High antibodylevels in LI-positive patients correlated with some immunologic and biochemicalparameters. Further studies should be performed to determine protective antibody levels against reinfection, how long protective titers last and the mechanisms bywhich COVID-19 symptoms, demographics and comorbidities may drive higher antibodylevels.

TI  - The root-associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal assemblages of exotic alienplants are simplified in invaded distribution ranges, but dominant species areretained: A trans-continental perspective.
LID - 10.1111/1758-2229.13108 [doi]
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) provide crucial support for the establishment of plants in novel environments. We hypothesized that the OTU/genus richness and diversity of soil- and root-associated AMF associated with alien plant species intheir exotic ranges are lower than those in their native ranges. We examined the root-associated and soil-dwelling AMF of 11 invasive plant species in theirnative and exotic ranges in the United States and Europe by DNA sequencing of theITS2 locus. Examined root-associated AMF assemblages were simplified, whichmanifested as the loss of several AMF genera in the exotic ranges of the plants. These fungal assemblages were also characterized by greater dominance andsimplification of the fungal assemblages. The dominant fungal genera were presentregardless of whether their host plants were in their native or exotic ranges.Interestingly, both the native and invaded soils hosted diverse local AMFassemblages. Therefore, alien plant invasions were not limited to soils with low AMF diversity. Some AMF taxa could be context-dependent passengers rather thandrivers of alien plant invasions. Further studies should identify functions ofAMF missing or less abundant in roots of plants growing in exotic ranges.

TI  - BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination Against COVID-19 is Associated with DecreasedLikelihood of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in U.S. Children Ages 5-18 Years.
LID - ciac637 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), linked toantecedent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection, is associated with considerable morbidity. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by vaccination might alsodecrease MIS-C likelihood. METHODS: In a multicenter case-control public healthinvestigation of children ages 5-18 years hospitalized from July 1, 2021 to April7, 2022, we compared the odds of being fully vaccinated (two doses of BNT162b2vaccine >/=28 days before hospital admission) between MIS-C case-patients andhospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. These associationswere examined by age group, timing of vaccination, and periods of Delta andOmicron variant predominance using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Wecompared 304 MIS-C case-patients (280 [92%] unvaccinated) with 502 controls (346 [69%] unvaccinated). MIS-C was associated with decreased likelihood ofvaccination (aOR, 0.16 95% CI, 0.10-0.26), including among children ages 5-11years (aOR, 0.22 95% CI, 0.10-0.52), ages 12-18 years (aOR, 0.10 95% CI,0.05-0.19), and during the Delta (aOR, 0.06 95% CI, 0.02-0.15) and Omicron (aOR, 0.22 95% CI, 0.11-0.42) variant-predominant periods. This association persistedbeyond 120 days after the second dose (aOR, 0.08, 95% CI, 0.03-0.22) in 12-18year-olds. Among all MIS-C case-patients, 187 (62%) required intensive care unit admission and 280 (92%) vaccine-eligible patients were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS:Vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 is associated with reduced likelihood ofMIS-C in children ages 5-18 years. Most vaccine eligible hospitalized patientswith MIS-C were unvaccinated.

AB  - Enzymes play a powerful role as catalysts with high specificity and activityunder mild environmental conditions. Significant hurdles, such as reducedsolubility, reduced shelf-life, aggregate formation, and toxicity, are stillongoing struggles that scientists come across when purifying recombinantproteins. Over the past three decades, PEGylation techniques have been utilizedto significantly overcome low solubility; increased protein stability,shelf-life, and bioactivity; and prevented protein aggregate formation. Thisreview seeks to highlight the impact of PEG-based formulations that aresignificantly utilized to obtain favourable protein physiochemical properties.The authors further discuss other techniques that can be employed such ascoexpression studies and nanotechnology-based skills to obtaining favourableprotein physiochemical properties.

AB  - Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, and the pathogenesis of thedisease is complex with both bacterial and host factors contributing toinflammatory responses. Lyme disease affects different organs including jointsand results in arthritis. Immune responses stimulated by B. burgdorferi throughtoll-like receptors cause infiltration of leukocytes, which produce inflammatory cytokines and facilitate spirochete clearance. However, arthritic manifestations and chronic fatigue syndrome-like symptoms persist long after completion ofantibiotic treatment regimens in a significant number of patients. To counter theeffects of inflammation, treatment by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,hydroxychloroquine, or synovectomy to eradicate inflammatory arthritis in theinvolved joint could be employed; however, they often have long-termconsequences. Acupuncture has been used for a long time in Asian medicine todiminish pain during various ailments, but the effects and its mechanism are justbeginning to be explored. Control of inflammation by neuronal stimulation hasbeen exploited as a systemic therapeutic intervention to arrest inflammatoryprocesses. Our objective was to determine whether activation of the sciatic-vagalnetwork by electroacupuncture on ST36 acupoint, which is used to control systemicinflammation in experimental models of infectious disorders such as endotoxemia, can also alleviate Lyme arthritis symptoms in mice. This aim was furtherstrengthened by the reports that sciatic-vagal neuronal network stimulation canlead to dopamine production in the adrenal medulla and moderate the production ofinflammatory factors. We first assessed whether electroacupuncture affectsspirochete colonization to attenuate Lyme arthritis. Interestingly,bioluminescent B. burgdorferi burden detected by live imaging and qPCR weresimilar in electroacupuncture- and mock-treated mice, while electroacupunctureinduced a lasting anti-inflammatory effect on mice. Despite the discontinuationof treatment at 2 weeks, the simultaneous decrease in neutrophils in the jointsand inflammatory cytokine levels throughout the body at 4 weeks suggests asystemic and persistent effect of electroacupuncture that attenuates Lymearthritis. Our results suggest that electroacupuncture-mediated anti-inflammatoryresponses could offer promising healthcare benefits in patients suffering fromlong-term Lyme disease manifestations.

AB  - Individuals infected with P. falciparum develop antibody responses tointra-erythrocytic gametocyte proteins and exported gametocyte proteins presenton the surface of infected erythrocytes. However, there is currently limitedknowledge on the immunogenicity of gametocyte antigens and the specificity ofgametocyte-induced antibody responses. In this study, we assessed antibodyresponses in participants of two controlled human malaria infection (CHMI)studies by ELISA, multiplexed bead-based antibody assays and protein microarray. By comparing antibody responses in participants with and without gametocyteexposure, we aimed to disentangle the antibody response induced by asexual andsexual stage parasites. We showed that after a single malaria infection, asignificant anti-sexual stage humoral response is induced in malaria-naiveindividuals, even after exposure to relatively low gametocyte densities (up to~1,600 gametocytes/mL). In contrast to antibody responses to well-characterisedasexual blood stage antigens that were detectable by day 21 after infection,responses to sexual stage antigens (including transmission blocking vaccinecandidates Pfs48/45 and Pfs230) were only apparent at 51 days after infection. Wefound antigens previously associated with early gametocyte or anti-gameteimmunity were highly represented among responses linked with gametocyte exposure.Our data provide detailed insights on the induction and kinetics of antibodyresponses to gametocytes and identify novel antigens that elicit antibodyresponses exclusively in individuals with gametocyte exposure. Our findingsprovide target identification for serological assays for surveillance of themalaria infectious reservoir, and support vaccine development by describing theantibody response to leading vaccine antigens after primary infection.

PG  - e1407
LID - 10.1002/cti2.1407 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Crohn's disease (CD) initiation and pathogenesis are believed toinvolve an environmental trigger in a genetically susceptible person that resultsin an immune response against commensal gut bacteria, leading to a compromisedintestinal epithelial barrier and a cycle of inflammation. However, it has beendifficult to study the contribution of all factors together in a physiologically relevant model and in a heterogenous patient population. Methods: We developed anautologous colonic monolayer model that incorporated the immune response from thesame donor and a commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.Two-dimensional monolayers were grown from three-dimensional organoids generated from intestinal biopsies, and the epithelial integrity of the epithelium wasmeasured using transepithelial electrical resistance. We determined the effect ofimmune cells alone, bacteria alone and the co-culture of immune cells andbacteria on integrity. Results: Monolayers derived from CD donors had impairedepithelial integrity compared to those from non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) donors. This integrity was further impaired by culture with bacteria, but notimmune cells, despite a higher frequency of inflammatory phenotype peripheral Tcells in CD donors. Variability in epithelial integrity was higher in CD donorsthan in non-IBD donors. Conclusion: We have developed a new autologous model tostudy the complexity of CD, which allows for the comparison of the barrierproperties of the colonic epithelium and the ability to study how autologousimmune cells directly affect the colonic barrier and whether this is modified by luminal bacteria. This new model allows for the study of individual patients and could inform treatment decisions.

PG  - 883805
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.883805 [doi]
AB  - Vaginal cancer is a rare and uncommon disease that is rarely discussed. Although vaginal cancer traditionally occurs in older postmenopausal women, the incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers is increasing in younger women. Cervical cancer cells contain high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 proteins and inhibiting HPV gene expression leads the cells to stopproliferating and enter senescence. As E6, and E7 protein promoted thecarcinogenesis mechanism, and here not only regulate the cellular degradation of P53, and pRb but also enhances the cell proliferation along with E6 proteintargets the p53 for breakdown and subsequently promote the apoptotic cell death, and DNA repair inhibition, that is indispensable to the continue the lifecycle ofthe HPV. As a synchronous or metachronous tumor, vaginal cancer is frequentlyfound in combination with cervical cancer. It is uncertain what causes invasivefemale vaginal organ cancer. HPV type 16 is the most often isolated HPV type infemale vaginal organ cancers. Due to cancer's rarity, case studies have provided the majority of etiologic findings. Many findings demonstrate that ringpessaries, chronic vaginitis, sexual behavior, birth trauma, obesity, vaginalchemical exposure, and viruses are all risk factors. Because of insufficientunderstanding and disease findings, we are trying to find the disease's mechanismwith the available data. We also address different risk factors, therapy atvarious stages, diagnosis, and management of vaginal cancer in this review.

PG  - 924696
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.924696 [doi]
AB  - Hepatobiliary tumors, which include cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and gallbladder cancer, are common cancers that have high morbidity andmortality rates and poor survival outcomes. In humans, the microbiota iscomprised of symbiotic microbial cells (10-100 trillion) that belong to thebacterial ecosystem mainly residing in the gut. The gut microbiota is acomplicated group that can largely be found in the intestine and has a dual role in cancer occurrence and progression. Previous research has focused on thecrucial functions of the intestinal microflora as the main pathophysiologicalmechanism in HCC development. Intestinal bacteria produce a broad range ofmetabolites that exhibit a variety of pro- and anticarcinogenic effects on HCC.Therefore, probiotic alteration of the gut microflora could promote gut florabalance and help prevent the occurrence of HCC. Recent evidence from clinical andtranslational studies suggests that fecal microbiota transplant is one of themost successful therapies to correct intestinal bacterial imbalance. We reviewthe literature describing the effects and mechanisms of the microbiome in the gutin the context of HCC, including gut bacterial metabolites, probiotics,antibiotics, and the transplantation of fecal microbiota, and discuss thepotential influence of the microbiome environment on cholangiocarcinoma andgallbladder cancer. Our findings are expected to reveal therapeutic targets forthe prevention of hepatobiliary tumors, and the development of clinical treatmentstrategies, by emphasizing the function of the gut microbiota.

AB  - Objective: Cefoperazone/sulbactam is a commonly used antibiotic combinationagainst the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing bacteria. Theobjective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a newcefoperazone/sulbactam combination (3:1) for Enterobacteriaceae infection viamodel-informed drug development (MIDD) approaches. Methods: Sulperazon[cefoperazone/sulbactam (2:1)] was used as a control. Pharmacokinetic (PK) datawas collected from a clinical phase I trial. Minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) were determined using two-fold broth microdilution method. The percenttime that the free drug concentration exceeded the minimum inhibitoryconcentration (%fT>MIC) was used as the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic indicatorcorrelated with efficacy. Models were developed to characterize the PK profile ofcefoperazone and sulbactam. Monte Carlo simulations were employed to determinethe investigational regimens of cefoperazone/sulbactam (3:1) for the treatment ofinfections caused by Enterobacteriaceae based on the probability of targetattainment (PTA) against the tested bacteria. Results: Two 2-compartment modelswere developed to describe the PK profiles of cefoperazone and sulbactam.Simulation results following the single-dose showed that the regimens ofcefoperazone/sulbactam combinations in the ratios of 3:1 and 2:1 achieved similarPTA against the tested bacteria. Simulation results from the multiple-dose showedthat the dosing regimen of cefoperazone/sulbactam (4 g, TID, 3 g:1 g) showedslightly better antibacterial effect than cefoperazone/sulbactam (6 g, BID, 4 g:2g) against the Escherichia coli (ESBL(-)) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL(-)).For the other tested bacteria, the above regimens achieved a similar PTA.Conclusions: Cefoperazone/sulbactam (3:1) showed similar bactericidal activity tosulperazon [cefoperazone/sulbactam (2:1)] against the tested bacteria. For theESBL-producing and cefoperazone-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae,Cefoperazone/sulbactam (3:1) did not exhibit advantage as anticipated. Our study indicated that further clinical trials should be carried out cautiously to avoid the potential risks of not achieving the expected target.

AB  - Primary liver cancer is the third most common malignancy, and hepatocellularcarcinoma is its main subtype, with a high recurrence rate and high mortality.Intestinal microflora and metabolic disorders are present in most HCC patients.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in the composition of intestinal microorganisms and the transformation of active metabolites. Manyscholars are trying to develop related drugs to assist in the treatment of liver cancer. In the preliminary study of the research group, it was found that theJiawei Xiaoyao San has a certain therapeutic effect on liver cancer, but thespecific mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, this study constructed a livercancer rat model with liver stagnation and spleen deficiency, to explore theregulatory effect of Jiawei Xiaoyao San on plasma metabolites and intestinalmicroflora and to find the potential mechanism of Jiawei Xiaoyao San in thetreatment of liver cancer. Plasma samples and fecal samples were collected fromliver cancer rats with liver depression and spleen deficiency for microbiome 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolic ESI-QTRAP-MS/MS analysis. Various bioinformaticsmethods were used to analyze the dataset individually and in combination. Theanalysis and identification of plasma metabolomics showed that the interventioneffect of Jiawei Xiaoyao San on liver cancer rats with liver depression andspleen deficiency was related to 11 differential metabolites and signal pathways such as primary bile acid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, pantothenateand COA biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, cholesterol metabolism, and bilesecretion. Combined with fecal microbiological analysis, it was found that JiaweiXiaoyao San could significantly change the composition of intestinal flora inliver cancer rates, increase beneficial bacteria, and reduce the composition ofharmful bacteria. This study provides some experimental basis for the traditionalChinese medicine theory and clinical application of Jiawei Xiaoyao San in theadjuvant treatment of liver cancer. The potential mechanism may be to regulatemetabolism and intestinal flora to play the role of regulating liver depression, activating blood, and detoxifying, to achieve the purpose of adjuvant treatmentof liver cancer.

AB  - Aim: To determine the antibiotic resistance patterns, detection of carbapenemase genes in uropathogenic bacilli belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family and to correlate it with clinical data. Materials and Methods: Identification andantibiotic sensitivity testing of the uropathogenic Enterobacteriaceae was doneby using VITEK2 Compact (C) system. Multiplex PCR was used to detect blaIMP,blaKPC, blaNDM1, blaOXA -48, and blaVIM genes. Results: Out of 1602 urinesamples, 417 (26%) showed significant growth, and in these 311 (74.6%) belongedto the Enterobacteriaceae family. Escherichia coli showed a relatively low rateof resistance to nitrofurantoin (17/205; 8.3%), with the majority of the isolatesshowing a MIC value of </=16 microg/mL when compared to Klebsiella spp. (55/86;64%), with MIC values for the majority of isolates being 128 microg/mL.Klebsiella spp. showed a relatively low rate of resistance to nalidixic acid(48/86; 55.8%) when compared with E. coli isolates (179/205; 87.3%). Out of 145isolates tested, we found blaNDM in 11 (7.58%), bla OXA -48 in 8 (5.51%), bla VIMin 4 (2.75%), bla KPC in one (0.6%) and blaIMP in none of the isolates. Of these 3 isolates were carbapenem sensitive, the rest were resistant. Conclusion: Mostof the isolates were sensitive to fosfomycin, carbapenems and resistant tocephalosporins and nalidixic acid. We detected carbapenemase genes in 13 (59%)out of 22 carbapenem resistant isolates and 3 (2.4%) out of 123 carbapenemsensitive isolates.

AB  - Background: Antibiotic resistance is becoming a global issue, with estimated 2.8 million people in the United States developing antibiotic-resistant diseases eachyear. The carriage of ESBL and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae amonghospitalized patients is a threat to the future of antibiotic treatment.Objective: Multi-drug resistance profile, prevalence of extended-spectrumbeta-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli among admittedpatients after surgery with suspected surgical site nosocomial infection northeast Ethiopia. Material and Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study wasconducted from April 2021 to February 2022. Socio-demographic and clinical datawere assessed using a structured questionnaire. A total of 384 relevant clinical samples (pus, pus aspirates, and wound swabs) were collected aseptically andprocessed within 30 min by placing the swabs into the sterile test tubes having0.5 mL of sterile normal saline. The samples were cultured on MacConkey agar,chocolate agar and blood agar, and species identification was done using standardbiochemical tests. Disk diffusion antimicrobial sensitivity test was done onMueller-Hinton agar. All the cefoxitin resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates werechecked for the presence of AmpC beta-lactamase using four cartridges of diskdiffusion tablets. ESBL output validation was conducted by the combination disktest. The production of Carbapenemase was checked using modified carbapeneminactivation method. Results: The prevalence of significant bacterial nosocomial infection among surgical site infection 343 (89.32%). S. aureus 125 (36.4%) waspredominant followed by E. coli 80 (23.3%) P. aeruginosa 31 (9.03%). The overall MDR rate of isolated bacteria was 251 (73.3%). About 150 (73.9%) bacteria weresuspected for ESBL production and 67 (33%) AmpC beta-lactamase and 27 (13.3%)Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacterial, respectively. Conclusions andRecommendations: The severity of ESBL-PE was critical, and the CPE was alarming. Meropenem and imipenem were the most effective antibiotics against ESBL-producingEnterobacteriaceae. Therefore, strict infection prevention and control measuresare needed.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution and drugresistance of pathogenic bacteria and the prognosis of patients with sepsisbloodstream infection with renal insufficiency. Methods: One hundred and twelvepatients with septicemic bloodstream infection with renal insufficiency and 112patients with septic bloodstream infection without renal insufficiency wereselected as study group and control group, respectively. We compare thedistribution of pathogenic bacteria, analyze the drug resistance of majorbacteria, and compare the efficacy, the incidence of septic shock, duration ofmechanical ventilation, hospitalization time, and duration of antimicrobial drug administration between the two groups. Results: A total of 140 pathogenic strainswere isolated from blood cultures in the study group, and 136 strains wereisolated from blood cultures in the control group. The sepsis bloodstreaminfection was mainly caused by Gram-negative bacteria, accounting for 59.42%(164/276). Among the gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichiacoli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii had higher resistancerates to levofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin sodium tazobactam, and amikacin.Among the gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, andStaphylococcus aureus had high resistance rates to clindamycin, cefazolin,penicillin G, gentamicin, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. The rate of extendedspectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs)-producing enterobacteria and multi-drug resistantPseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) infection was significantly higher in the studygroup than in the control group; there was no difference in multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), andmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) between the two groups. Theduration of hospitalization and the duration of antimicrobial drug administrationwere longer in the study group than in the control group. Conclusion: Thepathogenic bacteria in patients with sepsis bloodstream infection with renalinsufficiency are mainly Gram-negative bacteria, are more difficult to be cured, have a longer course of treatment, and need to use antibacterial drugs for a longtime.

LID - 10.2147/IDR.S347545 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Chikungunya is caused by an alpha virus transmitted to humans by aninfected mosquito. Infection is generally considered to be self-limiting andnon-critical. Chikungunya infection may be diagnosed by severe joint pain withfever, but it is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of chikungunya arecommon to many pathogens, including dengue fever. Diagnosis mainly depends onviral culture, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and IgM ELISA. Early and accurate diagnosis of the virus can be achieved by theapplication of PCR methods, but the high cost and the need for a thermal cyclerrestrict the use of such methods. On the other hand, antibody-based IgM ELISA is considered to be inexpensive, but antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV)only develop after 4 days of infection, so it has limited application in theearlier diagnosis of viral infection and the management of patients. Because ofthese challenges, a simple antigen-based sensitive, specific, and rapid detectionmethod is required for the early and accurate clinical diagnosis of chikungunya. Methods: The amino acid sequence of CHIKV ectodomain E1 and E2 proteins wasanalyzed using bioinformatics tools to determine the antigenic residues,particularly the B-cell epitopes and their characteristics. Recombinant E2-E1CHIKV antigen was used for the development of polyclonal antibodies in hamstersand IgG was purified. Serological tests of 96 CHIKV patients were conducted byantigen-capture ELISA using primary antibodies raised against rCHIKV E2-E1 inhamsters and human anti-CHIKV antibodies. Results: We observed high specificityand sensitivity, of 100% and 95.8%, respectively, and these values demonstratethe efficiency of the test as a clinical diagnostic tool. There was nocross-reactivity with samples taken from dengue patients. Discussion: Our simple and sensitive sandwich ELISA for the early-phase detection of CHIKV infection maybe used to improve the diagnosis of chikungunya.

AB  - Observational findings achieved that gut microbes mediate human metabolic health and disease risk. The types of intestinal microorganisms depend on the intake of food and drugs and are also related to their metabolic level and genetic factors.Recent studies have shown that chronic inflammatory pain is closely related tointestinal microbial homeostasis. Compared with the normal intestinal flora, the composition of intestinal flora in patients with chronic inflammatory pain hadsignificant changes in Actinomycetes, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, etc. At the sametime, short-chain fatty acids and amino acids, the metabolites of intestinalmicroorganisms, can regulate neural signal molecules and signaling pathways, thusaffecting the development trend of chronic inflammatory pain. Glucocorticoids andnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of chronic inflammatorypain, the main mechanism is to affect the secretion of inflammatory factors andthe abundance of intestinal bacteria. This article reviews the relationshipbetween intestinal microorganisms and their metabolites on chronic inflammatorypain and the possible mechanism.

AB  - Background: Pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection has become apublic health concern in China and around the world. The objective of this study was to describe the longitudinal changes in the frequency and diversity of NTM innorthern China. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data on mycobacteriumspecies in Beijing Chest Hospital from January 2014 to December 2021. Theisolates were identified to species level by targeted DNA sequencing. Results:After excluding duplicates, 1,755 NTM strains were analyzed, which were from 27provinces in China over 8 years. Among all mycobacteria, the proportion of NTMincreased each year, from 4.24% in 2014 to 12.68% in 2021. Overall, 39 different NTM species were identified, including 23 slow growing mycobacteria (SGM) and 16 rapid growing mycobacteria (RGM). The most common species were M. intracellulare (51.62%), M. abscessus (22.22%), M. kansasii (8.32%), M. avium (7.75%) and M.fortuitum (2.05%). The number of NTM species identified also increased each year from 9 in 2014 to 26 in 2021. Most species showed stable isolation rates over theyears; however, the proportion of M. avium increased from 3.85 to 10.42% duringthe study period. Besides, 81 non-mycobacteria strains, including Gordonia (21isolates), Nocardia (19 isolates) and Tsukamurella (17 isolates), etc., were alsodiscovered. Conclusion: The proportion of NTM and species diversity increasedconsiderably in northern China from 2014 to 2021. M. intracellulare was the most common NTM isolated among respiratory specimens, followed by M. abscessus and M. kansasii. Rare NTM species and non-mycobacteria pathogens also need attention.

PG  - 4251-4260
LID - 10.2147/JIR.S369986 [doi]
AB  - Background: Purpura fulminans (PF), a rare, life-threatening disorder, is ahematological emergency in which there is skin necrosis, disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIC), and protein C deficiency. In PF, the skinnecrosis and DIC are secondary to protein C deficiency. This may progress rapidlyto multiorgan failure caused by the thrombotic occlusion of small- andmedium-sized blood vessels. Case Report: This article presents the case of a22-year-old male with fever as well as necrotic and purpuric skin lesions. Theultrasound and computed tomography scans revealed infections in the skin woundsas well as venous microthrombosis and thrombosis in multiple intracranial andpulmonary vessels. The laboratory tests showed signs of sepsis, thrombocytopenia,an abnormal decrease in protein C and antithrombin III, DIC, multiple organ andsystem failures, gastric varices, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The blood,sputum, and secretions under the skin lesions were cultured and were positive forKlebsiella pneumoniae. The results of the high-throughput genetic testing of the pathogenic microorganism DNA were consistent. In addition, human herpesvirus type5 was detected. The histopathological examination of the skin lesions revealedpathological features consistent with PF. After successful treatment by thedepartments of Dermatology, Emergency Critical Care Medicine, and the IntensiveCare Unit, the patient was discharged after 67 days of hospitalization.Conclusion: Adults with acquired protein C and/or S deficiency states, including certain bacterial and viral infections, who drink alcohol and take varieties ofnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics at the same time, may develop acuteinfectious PF. Clinicians should be aware of this for early diagnosis andtreatment.

TI  - IFN-gamma and LPS Induce Synergistic Expression of CCL2 in Monocytic Cells viaH3K27 Acetylation.
PG  - 4291-4302
LID - 10.2147/JIR.S368352 [doi]
AB  - Background: Overexpression of CCL2 (MCP-1) has been implicated in pathogenesis ofmetabolic conditions, such as obesity and T2D. However, the mechanisms leading toincreased CCL2 expression in obesity are not fully understood. Since bothIFN-gamma and LPS levels are found to be elevated in obesity and shown to beinvolved in the regulation of metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance, weinvestigated whether these two agents could synergistically trigger theexpression of CCL2 in obesity. Methods: Monocytes (Human monocytic THP-1 cells)were stimulated with IFN-gamma and LPS. CCL2 gene expression was determined byreal-time RT-PCR. CCL2 protein was determined by ELISA. Signaling pathways wereidentified by using epigenetic inhibitors and STAT1 siRNA. Acetylation of H3K27was analyzed by Western blotting. The acetylation level of histone H3K27 in thetranscriptional initiation region of CCL2 gene was determined by ChIP-qPCR.Results: Our results show that the co-incubation of THP-1 monocytes withIFN-gamma and LPS significantly enhanced the expression of CCL2, compared totreatment with IFN-gamma or LPS alone. Similar results were obtained usingprimary monocytes and macrophages. Interestingly, IFN-gamma priming was found to be more effective than LPS priming in inducing synergistic expression of CCL2.Moreover, STAT1 deficiency significantly suppressed this synergy for CCL2expression. Mechanistically, we showed that IFN-gamma priming induced acetylationof lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27ac) in THP-1 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) assay followed by qRT-PCR revealed increased H3K27ac at the CCL2 promoter proximal region, resulting in stabilized gene expression. Furthermore, inhibitionof histone acetylation with anacardic acid suppressed this synergistic response, whereas trichostatin A (TSA) could substitute IFN-gamma in this synergy.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that IFN-gamma, in combination with LPS, has thepotential to augment inflammation via the H3K27ac-mediated induction of CCL2 inmonocytic cells in the setting of obesity.

AB  - The microbes in the rhizosphere (or mycorrhizosphere) could promote plant growth,however, it is unclear whether mycorrhizosphere microbes could fight multiplefungal pathogens. In this study, twenty-one bacterial strains distributed in 6genera, including 5 Pseudomonas strains, were isolated from mycorrhizal samplesof Polyporus umbellatus that rely on other fungi during their life cycles.Further screening and pot experiments showed that the Pseudomonas strain ZL8 not only inhibited the growth of phytopathogenic fungi, but also promoted the growth of Salvia miltiorrhiza through inhibiting its wilting. In addition, strain ZL8was found to have the ability to dissolve phosphate, produce IAA and siderophore.Nineteen compounds were identified from the fermentation broth of strain ZL8, of which 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) had a significant inhibitory effect onphytopathogenic fungi with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 3.12-25 mug/mL. Molecular docking predicted that DAPG could bind to myosin I at two unique sites,which may be responsible to the inhibition of fungal growth. The evaluationresults showed that strain ZL8 can be used to develop a dual-purpose biocontrolagents and biofertilizer. These results also provide new insights into thediscovery and utilization of new resources for biocontrol agents andbiolfertilizers.

AB  - Environmental extremes such as hypersaline conditions are significant threats to agricultural productivity. The sustainable use of halophilic microbial strainswas evaluated in plant in a salt stress environment. Oxygen-evolving complex(OEC), energy compartmentalization, harvesting efficiencies (LHE), specificenergy fluxes (SEF), and nitrogen assimilation of oilseed crops (Sunflowercultivars) in a suboptimal environment was examined. Plants were grown in aplastic pot (15 x18 cm(2)) containing sterilized (autoclaved at 120 degrees C for1 h) soil. Twenty-five ml suspension (10(7) CFU/ml) each of Bacillus cereusstrain KUB-15 and KUB-27 (accession number NR 074540.1) and Bacilluslicheniformis strain AAB9 (accession number MW362506), were applied via drenchingmethod. Month-old plants were subjected to salt stress via gradual incrementmethod. The energy compartmentalization of microbial inoculated plants exposed tosalt stress revealed higher photosystem II (PSII) activity at the donor side,lesser photo-inhibition, and increased performance of oxygen-evolving complexcompared to control. High potassium (K(+)) and low sodium (Na(+)) ions in treatedleaves with the activated barricade of the antioxidant system stimulated byBacillus strains favored enhanced photochemical efficiency, smooth electrontransport, and lesser energy dissipation in the stressed plants. Moreover, theresults reveal the increased activity of nitrite reductase (NiR) and nitratereductase (NR) by microbial inoculation that elevated the nitrogen availabilityin the salt-stressed plant. The current research concludes that the applicationof bio-inoculants that reside in the hyper-saline environment offers substantial potential to enhance salt tolerance in sunflowers by modulating their wateruptake, chlorophyll, nitrogen metabolism, and better photochemical yield.

PG  - 925773
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.925773 [doi]
AB  - Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by Brucella spp. which can lead toheavy economic losses and severe human diseases. Thus, controlling brucellosis isvery important. Due to humans easily gaining brucellosis from animals, animalbrucellosis control programs can help the eradication of human brucellosis. Thereare two popular vaccines against animal brucellosis. Live attenuated Brucellaabortus strain 19 (S19 vaccine) is the first effective and most extensively used vaccine for the prevention of brucellosis in cattle. Live attenuated Brucellamelitensis strain Rev.1 (Rev.1 vaccine) is the most effective vaccine againstcaprine and ovine brucellosis. Although these two vaccines provide good immunity for animals against brucellosis, the expense of persistent serological responses is one of the main problems of both vaccines. The advantages and limitations ofBrucella vaccines, especially new vaccine candidates, have been less studied. In addition, there is an urgent need for new strategies to control and eradicatethis disease. Therefore, this narrative review aims to present an updatedoverview of the available different types of brucellosis vaccines.

TI  - Evidence of Neutralizing and Non-Neutralizing Anti-Glucosaminidase Antibodies in Patients With S. Aureus Osteomyelitis and Their Association With Clinical OutcomeFollowing Surgery in a Clinical Pilot.
PG  - 876898
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.876898 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis remains a very challenging condition; recent clinical studies have shown infection control rates following surgery/antibioticsto be ~60%. Additionally, prior efforts to produce an effective S. aureus vaccinehave failed, in part due to lack of knowledge of protective immunity. Previously,we demonstrated that anti-glucosaminidase (Gmd) antibodies are protective inanimal models but found that only 6.7% of culture-confirmed S. aureusosteomyelitis patients in the AO Clinical Priority Program (AO-CPP) Registry had basal serum levels (>10 ng/ml) of anti-Gmd at the time of surgery (baseline). We identified a small subset of patients with high levels of anti-Gmd antibodies andadverse outcomes following surgery, not explained by Ig class switching tonon-functional isotypes. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that clinical curefollowing surgery is associated with anti-Gmd neutralizing antibodies in serum.Therefore, we first optimized an in vitro assay that quantifies recombinant Gmdlysis of the M. luteus cell wall and used it to demonstrate the 50% neutralizing concentration (NC50) of a humanized anti-Gmd mAb (TPH-101) to be ~15.6 mug/ml. Wealso demonstrated that human serum deficient in anti-Gmd antibodies can becomplemented by TPH-101 to achieve the same dose-dependent Gmd neutralizingactivity as purified TPH-101. Finally, we assessed the anti-Gmd physical titerand neutralizing activity in sera from 11 patients in the AO-CPP Registry, whowere characterized into four groups post-hoc. Group 1 patients (n=3) had highanti-Gmd physical and neutralizing titers at baseline that decreased withclinical cure of the infection over time. Group 2 patients (n=3) had undetectableanti-Gmd antibodies throughout the study and adverse outcomes. Group 3 (n=3) had high titers +/- neutralizing anti-Gmd at baseline with adverse outcomes. Group 4 (n=2) had low titers of non-neutralizing anti-Gmd at baseline with delayed hightiters and adverse outcomes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that bothneutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-Gmd antibodies exist in S. aureusosteomyelitis patients and that screening for these antibodies could have a valuefor identifying patients in need of passive immunization prior to surgery. Futureprospective studies to test the prognostic value of anti-Gmd antibodies to assessthe potential of passive immunization with TPH-101 are warranted.

PG  - 956417
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.956417 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systematical autoimmune disease, characterized by chronic synovial joint inflammation and hurt. Porphyromonas gingivalis(P.gingivalis) can cause life-threatening inflammatory immune responses in humanswhen the host pathogenic clearance machinery is disordered. Some epidemiological studies have reported that P. gingivalis exposure would increase the prevalenceof RA. However, the results remain inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis wasdone to systematically analyze the relationship between P. gingivalis exposureand the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis. Database including Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE were searched for published epidemiologicalarticles assessed the relationship between P. gingivalis and RA. Obtained studieswere screened based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Theoverall Odds Ratios (ORs) of incorporated articles were pooled by random-effectmodel with STATA 15.1 software. The literature search returned a total of 2057studies. After exclusion, 28 articles were included and analyzed. The pooled ORs showed a significant increase in the risk of RA in individuals with P. gingivalisexposure (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.43-2.43). Subgroup analysis revealed that pooledORs from populations located in Europe (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.46-3.22) and NorthAmerica (OR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.23-5.08) were significantly higher than that frompopulation in Asia (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20). Substantial heterogeneity was observed but did not significantly influence the overall outcome. In conclusion, our results indicated P. gingivalis exposure was a risk factor in RA. Promptdiagnosis and management decisions on P. gingivalis antimicrobial therapy wouldprevent rheumatoid arthritis development and progression.

Mouse models of infection provide advantages due to genetic tractability, so developing murine models of Leptospira infection iscrucial for further understanding the biology of this organism. Previously ourlaboratory developed a short-term murine model of Borrelia burgdorferihematogenous dissemination to investigate the role of adhesion proteins onbacterial survival and dissemination within a host. Here we adapt this model toLeptospira. C3H/HeJ mice are anesthetized, inoculated intravenously, and thenbacteria are allowed to circulate for up to twenty-four hours. Mice areeuthanized, perfused with saline, and tissues are harvested for culture and DNApurification. Bacterial burdens are determined by quantitative PCR. Reproducible burdens of bacteria were found in tissues upon inoculation with pathogens andnon-pathogens, demonstrating the utility of this model to probe differentLeptospira species and strains. Pathogenic L. interrogans has a significantlyhigher burden in blood, liver, kidney, and bladder at one-hour post-inoculationwhen compared to non-pathogenic L. biflexa. Colonization of the kidney isessential to the life cycle of pathogenic Leptospira in nature. Measurableburdens of non-pathogenic L. biflexa were found in numerous organs and liveleptospires were recovered from blood samples for at least three hourspost-inoculation, contrary to the previous belief that non-pathogenic leptospiresare rapidly cleared. This short-term murine model of Leptospira hematogenousdissemination will allow for the interrogation of virulence factors potentiallyimportant for tissue colonization and evasion of host defenses, and represents a novel animal model for investigating determinants of Leptospira infection.

AB  - Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 13 (IL13)gene are associated with vulnerability to allergic diseases, such as asthma andallergic conjunctivitis (AC). Periostin, as an IL13-induced protein, has emerged as a novel biomarker in several allergic diseases. Data among Egyptian patientsare still scarce. Aim: To find out the association of IL13 rs20541 genepolymorphism and serum levels of periostin with asthma and AC among Egyptianpatients. Patients and Methods: Eighty-one Egyptian allergic patients withasthma, AC, and both asthma and AC (27 each), were enrolled in this case-control study. Twenty-seven age and gender-matched healthy volunteers served as controls.All participants were tested for IL13 rs20541 SNP by real-time polymerase chainreaction, TaqMan method. Serum levels of periostin and IL13 were assessed byELISA. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, asthmatic patients had a higherfrequency of the homozygous adenine/adenine (AA) genotype at IL13 rs20541 SNP(14.8% vs 3.7%) and a lower frequency of the guanosine/guanosine (GG) genotype(51.9% vs 55.6%), while AC patients had higher GG genotype (70.4% vs 55.6%) with no AA genotype detected, yet no significant difference was noticed (p = 7.053). Asignificantly higher serum periostin in asthmatic patients compared to controlswas found (p = 0.005). Higher levels of serum periostin, although nonsignificant,were recorded in AC patients compared to controls (22.88 +/- 10.01ng/mL and 17.51+/- 3.17ng/mL, respectively). Periostin was significantly higher in patients withIL13 AA and GA genotypes compared to those with GG genotype (p = 0.016). Asignificant positive correlation between serum periostin and serum IL13 amongallergic patients was recorded (r = 0.352, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Among Egyptianpatients, serum level of periostin is significantly associated with asthma andpositively correlates with IL13 level supporting its utility as a diagnosticbiomarker. IL13 rs20541 gene polymorphism does not seem to play an obvious rolein asthma and AC, which requires further evaluation.

The ribosome is one of the maintargets for antibiotics in bacterial cells. Even if the molecule does not suitthe clinical application for whatever reasons, an investigation of its mechanism of action can deepen our understanding of the ribosome function. Such data caninform us on how the already used translational inhibitors can be modified. Inthis study, we demonstrate that 1-(2-oxo-2-((4-phenoxyphenyl).

AB  - Age-associated changes in the structure of the intestinal microbiome and in itsinteraction with the brain via the gut-brain axis are increasingly beingimplicated in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Intestinal microbialdysbiosis and translocation of microbes and microbial products including fungalspecies into the brain have been implicated in the development of dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Using germ-free mice, we investigated if the fungal gutcommensal, Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen in humans, can traversethe gastrointestinal barrier and disseminate to brain tissue and whether ageingimpacts on the gut mycobiome as a pre-disposing factor in fungal brain infection.C. albicans was detected in different regions of the brain of colonised germ-freemice in both yeast and hyphal cell forms, often in close association withactivated (Iba-1(+)) microglial cells. Using high-throughput ITS1 ampliconsequencing to characterise the faecal gut fungal composition of aged and youngSPF mice, we identified several putative gut commensal fungal species withpathobiont potential although their abundance was not significantly differentbetween young and aged mice. Collectively, these results suggest that althoughsome fungal species can travel from the gut to brain where they can induce aninflammatory response, ageing alone is not correlated with significant changes ingut mycobiota composition which could predispose to these events. These resultsare consistent with a scenario in which significant disruptions to the gutmicrobiota or intestinal barrier, beyond those which occur with natural ageing,are required to allow fungal escape and brain infection.

AB  - Background: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is one of the most common cancer typesworldwide. The disease is responsible for about 200,000 deaths annually, thusimproved diagnostics and therapy is needed. A large body of evidence reveal that small RNAs of less than 40 nucleotides may act as tumor suppressors, oncogenes,and disease biomarkers, with a major focus on microRNAs. However, the role ofother families of small RNAs is not yet deciphered. Recent results suggest thatsmall RNAs and their modification status, play a role in BLCA development and arepromising biomarkers due to their high abundance in the exomes and body fluids(including urine). Moreover, free modified nucleosides have been detected atelevated levels from the urine of BLCA patients. A genome-wide view of smallRNAs, and their modifications, will help pinpoint the molecules that could beused as biomarker or has important biology in BLCA development. Methods: BLCAtumor tissue specimens were obtained from 12 patients undergoing transurethralresection of non-muscle invasive papillary urothelial carcinomas. Genome-wideprofiling of small RNAs less than 40 bases long was performed by a modifiedprotocol with TGIRT (thermostable group II reverse transcriptase) to identifynovel small RNAs and their modification status. Results: Comprehensive analysisidentified not only microRNAs. Intriguingly, 57 +/- 15% (mean +/- S.D.) ofsequencing reads mapped to non-microRNA-small RNAs including tRNA-derivedfragments (tRFs), ribosomal RNA-derived fragments (rRFs) and YRNA-derivedfragments (YRFs). Misincorporation (mismatch) sites identified potential basemodification positions on the small RNAs, especially on tRFs, corresponding tom(1)A (N(1)-methyladenosine), m(1)G (N(1)-methylguanosine) and m(2) 2G (N(2),N(2)-dimethylguanosine). We also detected mismatch sites on rRFs corresponding toknown modifications on 28 and 18S rRNA. Conclusion: We found abundantnon-microRNA-small RNAs in BLCA tumor samples. Small RNAs, especially tRFs andrRFs, contain modifications that can be captured as mismatch by TGIRT sequencing.Both the modifications and the non-microRNA-small RNAs should be explored as abiomarker for BLCA detection or follow-up.

AB  - Qualitative and quantitative PCR-based tests are widely used in both diagnostics and research to assess the prevalence of disease-causing pathogens in veterinary medicine. The efficacy of these tests, usually measured in terms of sensitivityand specificity, is critical in confirming or excluding a clinical diagnosis. We undertook a meta-analysis to assess the inherent value of published PCRdiagnostic approaches used to confirm and quantify bacteria and virusesassociated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in cattle. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)guidelines. A thorough search of nine electronic databases (Web of Science,EBSCOhost, Cambridge journals online, ProQuest, PubMed, Sage journals online,ScienceDirect, Wiley online library and MEDLINE) was undertaken to find studiesthat had reported on the use of PCR and/or qPCR for the detection and/orquantification of BRD associated organisms. All studies meeting the inclusioncriteria for reporting quantitative PCR for identification of BRD associatedmicroorganisms were included in the analysis. Studies were then assessed on theapplications of the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-TimePCR Experiment (MIQE) and PCR primer/probe sequences were extracted and testedfor in silico specificity using a high level of stringency. Fourteen full-textarticles were included in this study. Of these, 79% of the analysed articles did not report the application of the MIQE guidelines in their study. High stringencyin silico testing of 144 previously published PCR primer/probe sequences foundmany to have questionable specificity. This review identified a high occurrenceof primer/probe sequences with a variable in silico specificity such that thismay have implications for the accuracy of reporting. Although this analysis wasonly applied to one specific disease state, identification of animals suspectedto be suffering from bovine respiratory disease, there appears to be more broadlya need for veterinary diagnostic studies to adopt international best practice forreporting of quantitative PCR diagnostic data to be both accurate and comparable between studies and methodologies.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory airway diseases, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis,eosinophilic COPD and allergic rhinitis are a global health concern. Despite the coexistence of these diseases and their common pathophysiology, they are oftenmanaged independently, resulting in poor asthma control, continued symptoms andpoor quality of life. Understanding disease pathophysiology is important for besttreatment practice, reduced disease burden and improved patient outcomes. Thepathophysiology of type 2 inflammation is driven by both the innate immune systemtriggered by pollutants, viral or fungal infections involving type 2 innatelymphoid cells (ILC2) and the adaptive immune system, triggered by contact withan allergen involving type 2 T-helper (Th2) cells. Both ILC2 and Th2 cellsproduce the type-2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13), each withseveral roles in the inflammation cascade. IL-4 and IL-13 cause B-cell classswitching and IgE production, release of pro-inflammatory mediators, barrierdisruption and tissue remodelling. In addition, IL-13 causes goblet-cellhyperplasia and mucus production. All three interleukins are involved intrafficking eosinophils to tissues, producing clinical symptoms characteristic ofchronic inflammatory airway diseases. Asthma is a heterogenous disease;therefore, identification of biomarkers and early targeted treatment is critical for patients inadequately managed by inhaled corticosteroids and long-actingbeta-agonists alone. The Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines recommend add-onbiological (anti IgE, IL-5/5R, IL-4R) treatments for those not responding tostandard of care. Targeted therapies, including omalizumab, mepolizumab,reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab and tezepelumab, were developed on currentunderstanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 inflammation. These therapiesoffer hope for improved management of type 2 inflammatory airway diseases.

AB  - COPD patients have increased susceptibility to airway bacterial colonisation.Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae arethree of the most common respiratory bacterial species in COPD. H. influenzaecolonisation, but not other bacteria, in COPD patients is associated with higher sputum neutrophil counts. Alveolar macrophages are key in clearance of bacteriaas well as releasing mediators to recruit and activate other immune cells inresponse to infection. The aim was to characterise differences in COPD macrophageresponses to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae, focusing on releaseof inflammatory and chemotactic mediators, and apoptosis regulation. Lungmacrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages from COPD patients and controlsubjects were exposed to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. Cytokinesecretion (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, CXCL8, CCL5 andIL-1beta) were measured by ELISA and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR(RT-qPCR), and apoptosis genes MCL-1, BCL-2, BAX and BAK1 by RT-qPCR. Apoptosisand reactive oxygen species (ROS) release were also measured. Macrophagesresponded differentially to the bacterial species, with increased, prolongedproduction of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL8 in response to H. influenzaeand M. catarrhalis but not S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae initiated macrophageapoptosis and ROS release, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis did not and increasedanti-apoptosis gene expression (BCL-2 5.5-fold and MCL-1 2.4-fold, respectively).Differential cytokine responses of macrophages to these bacterial species canexplain neutrophilic airway inflammation associated with H. influenzae, but notS. pneumoniae in COPD. Furthermore, delayed macrophage apoptosis is a potentialmechanism contributing to inability to clear H. influenzae.

TI  - The Changes in Microbiotic Composition of Different Intestinal Tracts and theEffects of Supplemented Lactobacillus During the Formation of Goose Fatty Liver.
PG  - 906895
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.906895 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal bacteria play an important role in the formation of fatty liver inanimals by participating in the digestion and degradation of nutrients, producingvarious metabolites, and altering the barrier effect of the intestine. However,changes in the gut microbiota during the formation of goose fatty liver areunclear. In this study, 80 healthy Landes geese with similar body weights at 70days of age were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 48; fedad libitum) and the overfeeding group (n = 32; overfed). The intestinal contents were collected at 0, 12, and 24 days of overfeeding. The 16S rRNA and metagenomicsequencing analyses showed that the dominant phyla were Firmicutes,Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. At the genus level,Phyllobacterium, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, andRomboutsia were the dominant genera in the goose intestine, and most of them wereprobiotics. In the control group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in thejejunum and ileum gradually decreased with time, while that of Proteobacteriaincreased, whereas in the overfeeding group, the relative abundance of Firmicutesin the jejunum and ileum decreased and then increased with time, while that ofProteobacteria showed an opposite trend. In addition, supplementing Lactobacillusto the diet reduced body weight and fatty liver weight in overfed geese, butincreased the weight of abdominal fat, suggesting that Lactobacillussupplementation might affect the transport of nascent fat from the liver toabdominal fat. In conclusion, the species of intestinal-dominant bacteria in the geese are relatively stable, but their relative abundance and function areaffected by a number of factors. Overfeeding promotes the metabolism of nutrientsin the jejunum and ileum and increases bacterial adaptability to environmentalchanges by enhancing their ability to process environmental and geneticinformation more efficiently. These findings suggest that the effect ofoverfeeding on the composition of intestinal microbiota may indirectly influence the formation of goose fatty liver through the gut/liver axis.

AB  - The fish gut microbiome plays an important role in nutrition absorption andenergy metabolism. Studying the gut microbes of cold-water fish is important tounderstand the dietary adaptation strategies in extreme environments. In thisstudy, the gut samples of Schizothorax wangchiachii (SW, herbivorous),Schizothorax kozlovi (SK, omnivorous), and Percocypris pingi (PP, carnivorous) inthe upper Yangtze River were collected, and we sequenced 16S rRNA amplicon tostudy the potential relationship between gut microbes and host species. Theresults showed that gut microbial composition and diversity were significantlydifferent between the three cold-water fishes. These fishes had different keytaxa in their gut microbes, including bacteria involved in the breakdown of food (e.g., Cetobacterium, Aeromonas, and Clostridium sensu stricto 10). The highestalpha diversity indices (e.g., Chao 1 index) were identified in the herbivore(SW), followed by the carnivore (PP), and the lowest in the omnivore (SK).Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) results revealed that the gutmicrobial community of these species was different between host species. Theneutral community model (NCM) showed that the microbial community structure of SWwas shaped by stochastic processes, and the highest species dispersal was foundin SW, followed by PP, and the lowest in SK. The results of niche breadth agreed with these findings. Our results demonstrated that host species influenced thegut microbiome composition, diversity, and microbial community assembly processesof the three cold-water fishes. These findings implied that the variation of gut microbiome composition and function plays a key role in digesting and absorbingnutrients from different foods in cold-water fish.

PG  - 940196

AB  - The fucosyltransferase 2 gene (FUT2) mediates the synthesis of histoblood groupantigens (HBGA) that occur in vivo from multiple organs, particularly on thesurface of intestinal epithelial cells and body fluids. To date, many studieshave demonstrated that the interaction of HBGA with the host microbiota is thecause of pathogenesis of intestinal diseases, making FUT2 non-secretor a riskfactor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to the lack of HBGA. As HBGA alsoacts as an attachment site for norovirus (NoV) and rotavirus (RV), thenon-secretor becomes a protective factor for both viral infections. In addition, the interaction of norovirus and rotavirus with symbiotic bacteria has been foundto play an important role in regulating enteroviral infection in IBD. Given thecurrent incomplete understanding of the complex phenomenon and the underlyingpathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as IBD, it has recently beenhypothesized that the FUT2 gene regulates intestinal bacteria through attachment sites, may help to unravel the role of FUT2 and intestinal flora in the mechanismof intestinal diseases in the future, and provide new ideas for the preventionand treatment of intestinal diseases through more in-depth studies.

AB  - Recent improvements in microbiology and molecular epidemiology were largelystimulated by whole- genome sequencing (WGS), which provides an unprecedentedresolution in discriminating highly related genetic backgrounds. WGS is becoming the method of choice in epidemiology of fungal diseases, but its application isstill in a pioneer stage, mainly due to the limited number of available genomes. Fungal pathogens often belong to complexes composed of numerous cryptic species. Detecting cryptic diversity is fundamental to understand the dynamics and theevolutionary relationships underlying disease outbreaks. In this study, weexplore the value of whole-genome SNP analyses in identification of the pandemic pathogen Fusarium graminearum sensu stricto (F.g.). This species is responsiblefor cereal diseases and negatively impacts grain production worldwide. The fungusbelongs to the monophyletic fungal complex referred to as F. graminearum species complex including at least sixteen cryptic species, a few among them may beinvolved in cereal diseases in certain agricultural areas. We analyzed WGS datafrom a collection of 99 F.g. strains and 33 strains representing all knowncryptic species belonging to the FGSC complex. As a first step, we performed aphylogenomic analysis to reveal species-specific clustering. A RAxML maximumlikelihood tree grouped all analyzed strains of F.g. into a single clade,supporting the clustering-based identification approach. Although, phylogeneticreconstructions are essential in detecting cryptic species, a phylogenomic treedoes not fulfill the criteria for rapid and cost-effective approach foridentification of fungi, due to the time-consuming nature of the analysis. As an alternative, analysis of WGS information by mapping sequence data from individualstrains against reference genomes may provide useful markers for the rapididentification of fungi. We provide a robust framework for typing F.g. throughthe web-based PhaME workflow available at EDGE bioinformatics. The method wasvalidated through multiple comparisons of assembly genomes to F.g. referencestrain PH-1. We showed that the difference between intra- and interspeciesvariability was at least two times higher than intraspecific variationfacilitating successful typing of F.g. This is the first study which employs WGS data for typing plant pathogenic fusaria.

AB  - To verify whether the placenta harbors bacteria, and to explore the compositionof placental microbiota (if yes) and its association with adverse pregnancyoutcomes. The placental microbiota was detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencingtechnology. In the process of detecting placental samples, exogenous marinebacterial DNA that does not exist in the human body was artificially added toobtain a visible 16S band. At the same time, the sterile samples, such asscissors, sheets, and cotton swabs, in delivery and operating rooms werecollected as the environmental control samples. As a result, a total of 2,621,009sequences were obtained from 71 samples, 88.9% of which came from artificiallyadded exogenous bacterial DNA, suggesting that the placenta contained fewerbacteria. After removing the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that coexisted inenvironmental controls, the placenta was annotated with 11 phyla, 22 classes, 43 orders, 79 families, and 157 genera. The beta diversity analysis showed thatthere were significant differences in the placental microbiota between 10 womenwith gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (p AMOVA = 0.01) or 19 women withpremature rupture of membranes (PROM) (p AMOVA = 0.004), and 21 women withoutadverse pregnancy outcomes, respectively. There were higher abundances of genera Bifidobacterium, Duncaniella, and Ruminococcus in the placenta samples of womenwith GDM. The genera of Bacteroides, Paraprevotella, and Ruminococcus were moreenriched in the placental samples of women with PROM. The authors concluded that the placenta may harbor small amounts of microbiota, and significant differences in the dominant microbiota of the placenta were observed between those pregnantwomen with and without adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - In response to the increasing nosocomial infections caused byantimicrobial-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), bacteriophages(phages) have emerged as an alternative to antibiotics. Staphylococcusureilyticus, one of the representative species of the CoNS, is now considered anotable pathogen that causes nosocomial bloodstream infections, and itsbiofilm-forming ability increases pathogenicity and resistance to antimicrobialagents. In this study, a lytic phage infecting S. ureilyticus was newly isolated from wastewater collected from a sewage treatment plant and its biological andantimicrobial characteristics are described. The isolated phage, namedvB_SurP-PSU3, was morphologically similar to Podoviridae and could simultaneouslylyse some S. warneri strains used in this study. The sequenced genome of thephage consisted of linear dsDNA with 18,146 bp and genome-based phylogenyrevealed that vB_SurP-PSU3 belonged to the genus Andhravirus. Although itsoverall genomic arrangement and contents were similar to those of other membersof the Andhravirus, the predicted endolysin of vB_SurP-PSU3 distinctly differedfrom the other members of the genus. The bacteriolytic activity of vB_SurP-PSU3was evaluated using S. ureilyticus ATCC 49330, and the phage could efficientlyinhibit the planktonic growth of the bacteria. Moreover, the anti-biofilmanalysis showed that vB_SurP-PSU3 could prevent the formation of bacterialbiofilm and degrade the mature biofilm in vitro. In an additional cytotoxicityassay of vB_SurP-PSU3, no significant adverse effects were observed on the testedcell. Based on these findings, the newly isolated phage vB_SurP-PSU3 could beclassified as a new member of Andhravirus and could be considered an alternative potential biocontrol agent against S. ureilyticus infections and its biofilm.

AB  - Nitrogen cycle has been poorly investigated in Antarctic ecosystems. Inparticular, how extreme conditions of low temperature, dryness, and highradiation select the microorganisms involved in the cycle is not yet understood. Denitrification is an important step in the nitrogen cycle in which nitrate isreduced stepwise to the gases NO, N2O, and N2. Denitrification is carried out by a wide group of microorganisms spread in the phylogenetic tree. The aim of thiswork was to isolate and characterize denitrifying bacteria present in differentcold environments from Antarctica. Bacterial isolates were obtained from lake,meltwater, sea, glacier ice, ornithogenic soil, and penguin feces samples fromKing George Island, Fildes peninsula in the Antarctic. Samples were taken during the deicing season in five sampling campaigns. From all the samples we were able to isolate denitrifying strains. A total of 199 bacterial isolates with thecapacity to grow in anaerobic mineral media reducing nitrate at 4 degrees C were obtained. The characterization of the isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysisshowed a high predominance of the genus Pseudomonas, followed byJanthinobacterium, Flavobacterium, Psychrobacter, and Yersinia. Other minorgenera detected were Cryobacterium, Iodobacter, Kaistella, and Carnobacterium.The capacity to denitrify was not previously described for most of the bacteriarelated to our isolates and in many of them denitrifying genes were not presentsuggesting the presence of new genes in this extreme environment. Our workdemonstrates the ubiquity of denitrification in the Maritime Antarctica and givesimportant information linking denitrification at cold temperature with taxa in anunequivocal way.

AB  - Soil fertility can be improved by effectively utilizing agricultural waste. Strawcan supply energy and wood ash adds nutrients to improve soil quality. However,few kinds of research have investigated the effect of wood ash and straw on soil carbon sequestration and the soil bacterial population, particularly incalcareous soils. The main goal of this current study was to quantify the impact of a combination of wood ash and straw on the indicators described above usingstable delta(13)C isotope analyses by applying wheat straw to calcareous soilunder a long-term C4 crop rotation. The incubation experiment included fourtreatments as follows: (i) no amendment (Control); (ii) amendment with wood ash(W); (iii) amendment with straw (S); and (iv) a combined amendment of straw andwood ash (SW). Our results showed that sequestration of soil inorganic carbon(SIC) in the SW and W treatments was higher (an average of 7.78%) than that inthe S and Control treatments. The sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) in the SWtreatment was 1.25-fold greater than that in the S treatment, while there was no evident effect on the SOC content compared with straw alone. The microbialbiomass carbon increased under SW by 143.33%, S by 102.23%, and W by 13.89%relative to control. The dissolved organic carbon increased under SW by 112.0%, Sby 66.61%, and W by 37.33% relative to the control. The pH and electricalconductivity were higher in the SW and W treatments than in the S treatment andthe control. The SW was conducive to maintaining soil enzymatic activities andbacterial diversity. Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteriota were dominant in SW,while the Acidobacteria phyla were dominant in the S treatment. The diversity of bacteria in the soil and community composition of the bacteria were predominantlyassessed by the levels of water-soluble K, pH, and electrical conductivity. Theincorporation of straw and wood ash is probably more effective at improving SICand SOC sequestration and ameliorates the soil microhabitat.

AB  - The microbiome of tardigrades, a phylum of microscopic animals best known fortheir ability to survive extreme conditions, is poorly studied worldwide andcompletely unknown in North America. An improved understanding oftardigrade-associated bacteria is particularly important because tardigrades havebeen shown to act as vectors of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris in the laboratory. However, the potential role of tardigrades as reservoirs and vectors of phytopathogens has not been investigated further. This study analyzed themicrobiota of tardigrades from six apple orchards in central Iowa, United States,and is the first analysis of the microbiota of North American tardigrades. It is also the first ever study of the tardigrade microbiome in an agriculturalsetting. We utilized 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize thetardigrade community microbiome across four contrasts: location, substrate type(moss or lichen), collection year, and tardigrades vs. their substrate. Alphadiversity of the tardigrade community microbiome differed significantly bylocation and year of collection but not by substrate type. Our work alsocorroborated earlier findings, demonstrating that tardigrades harbor a distinctmicrobiota from their environment. We also identified tardigrade-associated taxa that belong to genera known to contain phytopathogens (Pseudomonas, Ralstonia,and the Pantoea/Erwinia complex). Finally, we observed members of the generaRickettsia and Wolbachia in the tardigrade microbiome; because these are obligateintracellular genera, we consider these taxa to be putative endosymbionts oftardigrades. These results suggest the presence of putative endosymbionts andphytopathogens in the microbiota of wild tardigrades in North America.

LID - 10.4103/tp.TP_52_20 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Giardiasis is one of the greatest public parasitic infectionscausing diarrheal and also known to be associated with high morbidity andmortality, among the children's particularly in developing countries with lesscleanliness practices. Thus, studying genomic variety of Giardia intestinalisaids to improve our perspective related to the variability in the genome of theparasite. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 1006 stoolsamples were collected from the rural (n = 500) and urban settings (n = 506) fromthe children (<15 years) with and without symptoms and were screened for thepresence of G. intestinalis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targetingtriosephosphate isomerase gene. Further, all PCR-positive amplicons weresubjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism using RsaI restrictionenzyme. Results: Of the total 1006 stool samples, 500 samples from rural screenedby PCR 108 (21%) were found to be positive for assemblage A, 116 (23.2%) belongto assemblage B, and 5 (1%) were mixed assemblages (A + B). Whereas in urban, of the 506 samples screened by PCR, 92 (18.1%) were found to be positive forassemblage A, 93 (18.3%) assemblage B, and 10 (1.9%) were mixed assemblages (A + B). No significant difference was found between the G. intestinalis assemblageswith clinical details of symptomatic and asymptomatic in children. Conclusions:This signifies the first study inspection in our location to shed lights anddelivers some preliminary data on assemblages and subassemblages. The resultssuggest that anthroponotic transmission could be a foremost transmission path forgiardiasis among the study population.

AB  - In this research, a series of 3-(pyridine-3-yl)-2-oxazolidinone derivatives wasdesigned, synthesized, and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity, whichincluded bacteriostatic, morphological, kinetic studies, and molecular docking.The results demonstrated that compounds 21b, 21d, 21e and 21f exhibited strongantibacterial activity similar to that of linezolid toward five Gram-positivebacteria. After observing the effect of the drug on the morphology and growthdynamics of the bacteria, the possible modes of action were predicted bymolecular docking. Furthermore, the antibiofilm activity and the potential drugresistance assay was proceeded. These compounds exhibited universal antibiofilmactivity and compound 21d showed significant concentration-dependent inhibitionof biofilm formation. Compound 21d also showed a stable effect on S. pneumoniae(ATCC 49619) with less drug resistance growth for 15 days, which is much longerthan that of linezolid. Overall, these results can be used to guide furtherexploration of novel antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Coix seed extract (CSE) and probiotics have been reported to regulate glycolipid metabolism via different modes of action. We tested the effects of CSE,Bifidobacterium BPL1, and their combination to determine their effects onglycolipid metabolism in obese mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks to establish an obesity model. Obese mice were selected and dividedinto four groups: the model control group and three intervention groups. After 10weeks of continuous gavage intervention, the mice in the intervention groupsexhibited lower body weight (lower about 2.31 g, vs. HFD mice 42.23 g) andepididymal (lower about 0.37 g, vs. HFD mice 2.5 g) and perirenal fat content(lower about 0.47 g, vs. HFD mice 0.884 g); decreased fasting blood glucose,total cholesterol, triglycerides, and VLDL; and increased HLDL, respiratoryexchange ratio, energy expenditure, and amount of exercise performed. CSE, BPL1and their combination can effectively control the weight gain in obese mice,reduce fat content, and regulate blood lipids and abnormal blood sugar. Theseresults may be related to reduce the chronic inflammatory states, improve energy metabolism, exercise, relieve insulin sensitivity, and reduce lipid synthesis viathe intervention of CSE, BPL1 and their combination. Compared with the single useof CSE alone, the combination of CSE + BPL1 can better exert the regulationfunction of intestinal flora, and change in the abundance of bacteria that could improve the level of inflammatory factors, such as increasing Bifidobacterium,reducing Lactococcus. Compared with the use of BPL1 alone, the combination of CSEand BPL1 can better regulate pancreatic islet and improve blood sugar. CSE mayact directly on body tissues to exert anti-inflammatory effects. BPL1 and CSE +BPL1 may improve the structure and function of the intestinal flora, and reducetissue inflammation.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectsof probiotics and glucose-lowering drugs (thiazolidinedione [TZD], glucagon-like pep-tide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RA], dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors, and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors [SGLT-2i]) in patients with type 2diabetes from randomized con-trolled trials (RCTs). The PubMed, Web of science,Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched on the treatment effects of probiotics and glucose-lowering drugs on glycemia, lipids, and blood pressuremetabolism published between Jan 2015 and April 2021. We performed meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We included 25 RCTs (2,843 participants).Overall, GLP-1RA, SGLT-2i, and TZD significantly reduce fasting blood sugar (FBS)and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), whereas GLP-1 RA increased the risk ofhypoglycaemia. Multispecies probiotics decrease FBS, total cholesterol (TC), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP). Moreover, subgroup analysesindicated that participants aged >55 years, BMI >/=30 kg/m(2), longer duration ofintervention, and subjects from Eastern countries, showed significantly higherreduction in FBS and HbA1c, TC, TG and SBP. This meta-analysis revealed thatincluding multiple probiotic rather than glucose-lowering drugs might be morebeneficial regarding T2D prevention who suffering from simultaneouslyhyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.

TI  - Antifungal use via outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy.
LID - 10.1111/myc.13513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antifungal administration via outpatient parenteral antimicrobialtherapy (OPAT) is infrequent. As patients with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) receiving OPAT are at high risk of readmissions, careful, risk based patientselection and monitoring is important. OBJECTIVES: To describe our experiencemanaging IFIs via OPAT, including assessment of risk factors associated withunplanned readmissions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study ofoutpatients from two tertiary hospitals in Western Australia managed withparenteral antifungals for the treatment of IFIs from 2012 to 2020. Outcomesassessed were unplanned OPAT-related readmissions, adverse events and achievementof treatment aims at the completion of OPAT. RESULTS: Forty six patients wereincluded, encompassing 696 OPAT days. Twenty three (50%) patients receivedintravenous (IV) liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), 23 (50%) received IVechinocandins and one (2%) patient received IV fluconazole. One patient received both IV L-AmB and an echinocandin. Unplanned OPAT-related readmissions occurredin 13 (28%) patients and any adverse event occurred in 19 (41%), most commonlynephrotoxicity amongst patients receiving L-AmB. On univariate analysis,unplanned OPAT-related readmissions were more common in Mucorales infection,L-AmB doses of >/=5mg/kg and otorhinolaryngologic (ENT) infections. At thecompletion of OPAT, attainment of treatment aims occurred in 28 (61%) patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving parenteral antifungals via OPAT experience highrates of unplanned readmissions and adverse events. Risk factor identificationmay facilitate optimal patient selection and establishment of treatment aims.

PG  - 34894221115757
LID - 10.1177/00034894221115757 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Laryngeal abscesses are rare in the modern antibiotic era.Historically, they were associated with systemic infections including typhoidfever, measles, gonorrhea, syphilis, and tuberculosis. More recent authors havedescribed cases resulting from iatrogenic injury and immunosuppression. Thisreport presents a novel case of laryngeal abscess in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes and a detailed review of modern, reported cases of spontaneous laryngealabscess. METHODS: Report of a single case. Also, PubMed was queried for cases of laryngeal abscess since 1985. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old male with poorlycontrolled diabetes presented with odynophagia, dysphagia, and dyspnea. He hadbiphasic stridor, and flexible laryngoscopy showed reduced mobility of bilateral vocal folds and narrowed glottic airway. He was taken urgently for awaketracheostomy and microdirect laryngoscopy. Laryngoscopy demonstrated fullness andfluctuance of the right hemilarynx. The abscess cavity was entered endoscopicallyvia paraglottic incision extending into the subglottis. The patient was treatedwith an 8-week course of ampicillin-sulbactam with resolution of infection.RESULTS: Seven additional cases of spontaneous laryngeal abscesses publishedafter 1985 were identified. In total, 6 of 8 had some form of immunodeficiency(75%). The most common presenting symptoms were dysphonia (8/8, 100%),odynophagia (5/8, 62.5%), and dyspnea/stridor (4/8, 50%). All cases were treated with surgical incision and drainage. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal abscesses are rare inthe era of modern antibiotics. This review confirms that the majority of recentepisodes occurred in the setting of immunodeficiency and are caused bynon-tubercular bacteria. These infections are commonly associated with impairedvocal fold mobility which may contribute to dyspnea, stridor, and airwaycompromise. Surgical intervention is necessary for treatment and culture-directedantimicrobial therapy. Poorly controlled diabetes is a newly described contextfor development of spontaneous laryngeal abscess.

AB  - Increasing wastewater pollution owing to the briskly rising human population,rapid industrialization, and fast urbanization has necessitated highly efficient wastewater treatment technologies. Although several methods of wastewatertreatments are in practice, expensiveness, use of noxious chemicals, generationof unsafe by-products, and longer time consumption restrain their use to a great extent. Over the last few decades, nanotechnological wastewater treatmentapproaches have received widespread recognition globally. Microbially fabricated nanoparticles reduce the utilization of reducing, capping, and stabilizingagents, and exhibit higher adsorptive and catalytic efficiency than chemicallysynthesized nanomaterials. The present review comprehensively summarizes theapplications of microbial nanotechnology in the removal of a wide range ofnoxious wastewater pollutants. Moreover, prospects and challenges associated withthe integration of nanotechnology with other biological treatment technologiesincluding algal-membrane bioreactor, aerobic digestion, microbial fuel cells, andmicrobial nanofiber webs have also been briefly discussed.

TI  - Inhaling Essential Oils: Purported Benefits and Harms.

AB  - Patients with cystic fibrosis are experimenting with inhaling essential oils(scientifically described as random plant-derived secondary metabolites) through diffusers or nebulizers as a form of natural therapy to treat chronic lunginfections. In vitro studies are starting to be published on the effects ofessential oils (cinnamon, clove, oregano, and thyme) on bacteria commonly foundin the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. There are no clinical studies and therefore no data are available on a potential placebo effect. There is apotential risk of lipoid pneumonia with inhaling essential oils, although no casereports have been published. There is also potential for pesticide exposure,particularly with peppermint oil. Treating providers are encouraged to includediscussion of the use of herbal and other natural remedies with their patientsand patient caregivers.

TI  - Isolation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium bovis from a dog in Korea.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.21-0347 [doi]
AB  - A 3-year-old female Miniature Schnauzer dog with a week-long history ofgeneralized intention tremor and progressive weight loss for several months wasadmitted. Mild anemia, fever, splenomegaly, aseptic cerebral meningitis andsystemic lymph nodes enlargement were examined through erythrogram,ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.Mycobacterium bovis was identified via molecular microbiology having the samemolecular type as that of isolates from a cattle farm previously identified.However, the dog was raised in a city. The M. bovis had multidrug resistance(MDR)-bearing mutations in both katG and rpoB genes toward first-lineantibiotics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing anMDR M. bovis infection of a dog in Korea.

LID - 10.5650/jos.ess22068 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial resistance to already present antibiotics demands for new approaches infield of medicine. Scientists prefer nanoparticles (NPs) due to their promisingpotential in many applications. Two bacterial strains, Escherichia coli andBacillus subtilis were used for biogenic synthesis of NPs. Characterization ofprepared NPs was accomplished using UV-vis spectroscopy and fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The prepared NPs were confirmed by the color changefrom pale yellow to having white deposition for Zn NPs while from dark green tolight green for Ni NPs. UV-vis spectroscopy of E. coli and B. subtilis basedZnNPs showed highest peak at 354nm and 362nm, respectively. Likewise, E. coli andB. subtilis NiNPs showed peaks at 246 nm and 238 nm, respectively. Antibacterial activity of B. subtilis based ZnNPs showed significant (p </= 0.05) zone ofinhibition (ZOI; 27.3+/-0.6) against B. subtilis and 26.66+/-0.67 against E. coliat 100 mg/mL. Antibacterial activity of E. coli based ZnNPs showed 8.3+/-0.3 ZOI against B. subtilis and 6.6+/-0.3 ZOI against E. coli while NiNPs showed(25.0+/-0.0 mm) (ZOI) against B. subtilis and (25.0 +/- 0.3 mm) against E. coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of E. coli ZnNPs showed values of6.7+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 4.7+/-0.3 mug/mL for B. subtilis. MIC of B.subtilis ZnNPs showed 5.3+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 6.6+/-0.3 mug/mL for B.subtilis while NiNPs showed 33.0+/-1.0 mug/mL against E. coli and 24.0+/-1.0mug/mL against B. subtilis as effective inhibitory concentrations. Minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of E. coli ZnNPs showed 7.3+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 8.3+/-0.3 mug/mL for B. subtilis. MBC of B. subtilis ZnNPs showed7.6+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 8.6+/-0.3 mug/mL for B. subtilis while NiNPsshowed 45.7+/-1.3 mug/mL against E. coli and 33.0+/-1.0 mug/mL against B.subtilis as effective inhibitory concentrations. It was concluded from thecurrent study that biogenically synthesized ZnNPs and NiNPs are effective aspromising antibacterial agents and have potential applications in biomedicalfields.

TI  - Eukaryotic Microbial RNA Viruses-Acute or Persistent? Insights into TheirFunction in the Aquatic Ecosystem.
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME22034 [doi]
AB  - Isolated RNA viruses mainly parasitize eukaryotes. RNA viruses either expandhorizontally by infecting hosts (acute type) or coexist with the host and arevertically inherited (persistent type). The significance of persistent-type RNAviruses in environmental viromes (the main hosts are expected to be microbes) wasonly recently reported because they had previously been overlooked in virology.In this review, we summarize the host-virus relationships of eukaryotic microbialRNA viruses. Picornavirales and Reoviridae are recognized as representativeacute-type virus families, and most of the microbial viruses in Narnaviridae,Totiviridae, and Partitiviridae are categorized as representative persistent-typeviruses. Acute-type viruses have only been found in aquatic environments, whilepersistent-type viruses are present in various environments, including aquaticenvironments. Moreover, persistent-type viruses are potentially widely spread in the RNA viral sequence space. This emerging evidence provides novel insights intoRNA viral diversity, host-virus relationships, and their history of co-evolution.

TI  - Regulatory processes that maintain or alter ribosomal DNA stability during therepair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks.
LID - 10.1266/ggs.22-00046 [doi]
AB  - Organisms have evolved elaborate mechanisms that maintain genome stability.Deficiencies in these mechanisms result in changes to the nucleotide sequence as well as copy number and structural variations in the genome. Genome instabilityhas been implicated in numerous human diseases. However, genomic alterations can also be beneficial as they are an essential part of the evolutionary process.Organisms sometimes program genomic changes that drive genetic and phenotypicdiversity. Therefore, genome alterations can have both positive and negativeimpacts on cellular growth and functions, which underscores the need to controlthe processes that restrict or induce such changes to the genome. The ribosomalRNA gene (rDNA) is highly abundant in eukaryotic genomes, forming a cluster wherenumerous rDNA copies are tandemly arrayed. Budding yeast can alter the stability of its rDNA cluster by changing the rDNA copy number within the cluster or byproducing extrachromosomal rDNA circles. Here, we review the mechanisms thatregulate the stability of the budding yeast rDNA cluster during repair of DNAdouble-strand breaks that are formed in response to programmed DNA replicationfork arrest.

TI  - Evolutionary genomics analysis reveals gene expansion and functional diversity ofarylalkylamine N-acetyltransferases in Culicinae subfamily mosquitoes.
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.13100 [doi]
AB  - Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aaNAT), considered a potential newinsecticide target, catalyzes the acetylation of arylalkylamine substrates suchas serotonin and dopamine and, hence, mediates diverse functions in insects.However, the origin of insect aaNATs and the evolutionary process that generates multiple aaNATs in mosquitoes remain largely unknown. Here, we have analyzed the genomes of 33 species to explore and expand our understanding of the molecularevolution of this gene family in details. We show that aaNAT orthologs arepresent in bacteria, Placozoa, Cephalochordata, Cnidaria, Chondrichthyes,Teleoste, Crustacea and mammals as well as those from a number of insects, butabsent in some species of Mollusca, Echinozoa and Annelida as well as Arachnida. Particularly, more than 10 aaNATs were detected in Culicinae subfamilymosquitoes. Molecular evolutionary analysis of aaNAT/aaNAT-like genes inmosquitoes reveals that tandem duplication events lead to the gene expansion inCulicinae subfamily mosquitoes over approximately 190 Mya. Further selectionanalysis demonstrates that mosquito aaNATs evolved under strongly positivepressures that generated functional diversity following gene duplication events. Overall, this study may provide novel insights into the molecular evolution ofthe aaNAT family in mosquitoes. This article is protected by copyright. Allrights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals for purposes ofpreventing, controlling, and/or treating infections. In swine, a major driver of antimicrobial use is porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is caused by a virus that predisposes infected animals to secondary bacterialinfections. Numerous antimicrobial protocols are used to treat PRRS, but we have little insight into how these treatment schemes impact antimicrobial resistance(AMR) dynamics within the fecal microbiome of commercial swine. The aim of thisstudy was to determine whether different PRRS-relevant antimicrobial treatmentprotocols were associated with differences in the fecal microbiome and resistome of growing pigs. To accomplish this, we used a metagenomics approach tocharacterize and compare the longitudinal wean-to-market resistome and microbiomeof pigs challenged with PRRS virus and then exposed to different antimicrobialtreatments, and a group of control pigs not challenged with PRRS virus and havingminimal antimicrobial exposure. Genomic DNA was extracted from pen-levelcomposite fecal samples from each treatment group and subjected to metagenomicsequencing and microbiome-resistome bioinformatic and statistical analysis.Microbiome-resistome profiles were compared over time and between treatmentgroups. RESULTS: Fecal microbiome and resistome compositions both changedsignificantly over time, with a dramatic and stereotypic shift between weaningand 9 days post-weaning (dpw). Antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) richness anddiversity were significantly higher at earlier time points, while microbiomerichness and diversity were significantly lower. The post-weaning shift wascharacterized by transition from a Bacteroides-dominated enterotype toLactobacillus- and Streptococcus-dominated enterotypes. Both the microbiome andresistome stabilized by 44 dpw, at which point the trajectory ofmicrobiome-resistome maturation began to diverge slightly between the treatmentgroups, potentially due to physical clustering of the pigs. Challenge with PRRSvirus seemed to correspond to the re-appearance of many very rare andlow-abundance ARGs within the feces of challenged pigs. Despite very differentantimicrobial exposures after challenge with PRRS virus, resistome compositionremained largely similar between the treatment groups. Differences in ARGabundance between the groups were mostly driven by temporal changes in abundance that occurred prior to antimicrobial exposures, with the exception of ermG, whichincreased in the feces of treated pigs, and was significantly more abundant inthe feces of these pigs compared to the pigs that did not receive post-PRRSantimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The fecal microbiome-resistome of growing pigsexhibited a stereotypic trajectory driven largely by weaning and physiologicaging of the pigs. Events such as viral illness, antimicrobial exposures, andphysical grouping of the pigs exerted significant yet relatively minor influence over this trajectory. Therefore, the AMR profile of market-age pigs is theculmination of the life history of the individual pigs and the populations towhich they belong. Disease status alone may be a significant driver of AMR inmarket-age pigs, and understanding the interaction between disease processes and antimicrobial exposures on the swine microbiome-resistome is crucial todeveloping effective, robust, and reproducible interventions to control AMR.Video Abstract.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cervicovaginal (CV) microbiome is highly associated with vaginal health and disease in both pregnant and nonpregnant individuals. An overabundanceof Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) in the CV space is commonly associatedwith adverse reproductive outcomes including bacterial vaginosis (BV), sexuallytransmitted diseases, and preterm birth, while the presence of Lactobacillus spp.is often associated with reproductive health. While host-microbial interactionsare hypothesized to contribute to CV health and disease, the mechanisms by which these interactions regulate CV epithelial function remain largely unknown.RESULTS: Using an in vitro co-culture model, we assessed the effects ofLactobacillus crispatus (L. crispatus) and G. vaginalis on the CV epithelialbarrier, the immune mediators that could be contributing to decreased barrierintegrity and the immune signaling pathways regulating the immune response. G.vaginalis, but not L. crispatus, significantly increased epithelial cell deathand decreased epithelial barrier integrity in an epithelial cell-specific manner.A G. vaginalis-mediated epithelial immune response including NF-kappaB activationand proinflammatory cytokine release was initiated partially throughTLR2-dependent signaling pathways. Additionally, investigation of the cytokineimmune profile in human CV fluid showed distinctive clustering of cytokines byGardnerella spp. abundance and birth outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The results of thisstudy show microbe-specific effects on CV epithelial function. Altered epithelialbarrier function through cell death and immune-mediated mechanisms by G.vaginalis, but not L. crispatus, indicates that host epithelial cells respond to bacteria-associated signals, resulting in altered epithelial function andultimately CV disease. Additionally, distinct immune signatures associated withGardnerella spp. or birth outcome provide further evidence that host-microbialinteractions may contribute significantly to the biological mechanisms regulatingreproductive outcomes.

TI  - Assessing the associations between Aedes larval indices and dengue risk inKalutara district, Sri Lanka: a hierarchical time series analysis from 2010 to2019.
PG  - 277
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05377-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a major public health problem in Sri Lanka. Aedes vectorsurveillance and monitoring of larval indices are routine, long-establishedpublic health practices in the country. However, the association between Aedeslarval indices and dengue incidence is poorly understood. It is crucial toevaluate lagged effects and threshold values of Aedes larval indices to setpragmatic targets for sustainable vector control interventions. METHODS: Monthly Aedes larval indices and dengue cases in all 10 Medical Officer of Health (MOH)divisions in Kalutara district were obtained from 2010 to 2019. Using a novelstatistical approach, a distributed lag non-linear model and a two-stagedhierarchical meta-analysis, we estimated the overall non-linear and delayedeffects of the Premise Index (PI), Breteau Index (BI) and Container Index (CI) ondengue incidence in Kalutara district. A set of MOH division-specific variableswere evaluated within the same meta-analytical framework to determine theirmoderator effects on dengue risk. Using generalized additive models, we assessed the utility of Aedes larval indices in predicting dengue incidence. RESULTS: Wefound that all three larval indices were associated with dengue risk at a lag of 1 to 2 months. The relationship between PI and dengue was homogeneous across MOH divisions, whereas that with BI and CI was heterogeneous. The threshold values ofBI, PI and CI associated with dengue risk were 2, 15 and 45, respectively. Allthree indices showed a low to moderate accuracy in predicting dengue risk inKalutara district. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the potential of vectorsurveillance information in Kalutara district in developing a threshold-based,location-specific early warning system with a lead time of 2 months. Theestimated thresholds are nonetheless time-bound and may not be universallyapplicable. Whenever longitudinal vector surveillance data areavailable, themethodological framework we propose here can be used to estimatelocation-specific Aedes larval index thresholds in any other dengue-endemicsetting.

AB  - High stocking densities, closed animal houses, and elevated concentrations ofbacteria, fungi, and the products of their activity, including ammonia andhydrogen sulphide, have adverse health effects. Active techniques used to reduce unfavourable environmental conditions, such as ventilation, sprinkling, beddingsorbents, and nutritional treatments, are not always sufficient to improve theanimals' living environment. The current paper aims to evaluate the effect ofradiant catalytic ionization (RCI) on airborne microorganisms, cagemicrobiological status, gaseous ammonia concentrations, and the haematologicalstatus of mice in animal houses. After one week of operation of an RCI system,the number of airborne bacteria and fungi in the experimental room decreased incomparison to the first day of the experiment (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05respectively), as did the concentrations of ammonia (p < 0.01) and dust. At thesame time, the basic health parameters of the mice, determined in the blood, werevery similar between the control and experimental room. RCI seems to be an ideal solution to ensure high hygiene standards in animal rooms and houses with limiteduse of disinfectants or antibiotic treatment of sick animals. An additional,environmental benefit is the limited amount of nitrogen released.

PG  - 190
LID - 10.1186/s12866-022-02608-9 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of surface display technology intherapeutic development and enzyme immobilization. Utilization of lactic acidbacteria in non-GMO surface display applications is advantageous due to its GRAS status. This study aimed to develop a novel, non-GMO cell wall anchoring systemfor lactic acid bacteria using a cell-surface hydrolase (CshA) fromLactiplantibacillus plantarum SK156 for potential industrial and biomedicalapplications. Analysis of the CshA revealed that it does not contain any knownclassical anchor domains. Although CshA lacks a classical anchor domain, itsuccessfully displayed the reporter protein superfolder GFP on the surface ofseveral lactic acid bacteria in host dependent manner. CshA-sfGFP fusion protein was displayed greatest on Limosilactobacillus fermentum SK152. Pretreatment with trichloroacetic acid further enhanced the binding of CshA to Lm. fermentum. Thebinding conditions of CshA on pretreated Lm. fermentum (NaCl, pH, time, andtemperature) were also optimized, resulting in a maximum binding of up to 10(6)CshA molecules per pretreated Lm. fermentum cell. Finally, this studydemonstrated that CshA-decorated pretreated Lm. fermentum cells toleratesgastrointestinal stress, such as low pH and presence of bile acid. To ourknowledge, this study is the first to characterize and demonstrate thecell-surface display ability of CshA. The potential application of CshA innon-GMO antigen delivery system and enzyme immobilization remains to be tested.

AB  - PURPOSE: The clinical course of COVID-19 has been complicated by secondaryinfections, including bacterial and fungal infections. The rapid rise in theincidence of invasive mucormycosis in these patients is very much concerning.COVID-19-associated mucormycosis was detected in huge numbers during the secondwave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, with several predisposing factorsindicated in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology,predisposing factor, cumulative mortality and factors affecting outcomes amongthe coronavirus disease COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). METHODS: Amulticenter retrospective study across three tertiary health care centers inSouthern part of India was conducted during April-June 2021. RESULTS: Among the217 cases of CAM, mucormycosis affecting the nasal sinuses was the commonest,affecting 95 (44%) of the patients, orbital extension seen in 84 (38%), pulmonary(n = 25, 12%), gastrointestinal (n = 6, 3%), isolated cerebral (n = 2) anddisseminated mucormycosis (n = 2). Diabetes mellitus, high-dose systemic steroidswere the most common underlying disease among CAM patients. Themucormycosis-associated case-fatality at 6 weeks was 14%, cerebral or GI ordisseminated mucormycosis had 9 times higher risk of death compared to otherlocations. Extensive surgical debridement along with sequential antifungal drugtreatment improved the survival in mucormycosis patients. CONCLUSION: Judiciousand appropriate management of the predisposing factor and factors affectingmortality associated with CAM with multi-disciplinary approach and timelysurgical and medical management can be much helpful in achieving a successfuloutcome.

AB  - Swine pasteurellosis is one of the most economically important diseases of pigcaused by Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) capsular types A and D. Theseorganisms are commensals and opportunistic pathogens in the upper respiratorytract in pig. In the present study, we extracted whole outer membrane proteins(OMP) from P. multocida capsular types A and D and were mixed together in theratio of 1:1 forming bivalent outer-membrane proteins. The bivalent OMP wasadsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles. The size of aluminum hydroxidenanoparticles adsorbed outer membrane protein was found to be in the range of 125to 130 nm. We observed that aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles adjuvanted bivalent OMP-based vaccine elicited quicker immune kinetics in terms of IgG response ascompared to aluminum hydroxide microparticles adjuvanted bivalent bacterinvaccine against P. multocida capsular type A and D.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the anticancer potential of biosynthesized silvernanoparticles using marine derived fungi Hamigera pallida with theirantibacterial and antioxidant activities. RESULTS: The biosynthesis of silvernanoparticles (AgNPs) was assessed by the change in color from bright yellow todark brown. UV-Visible spectroscopy revealed its stability at 429 nm; ATR-FTIRspectroscopy revealed the functional group responsible for its production; X-Ray Diffraction revealed its crystalline FCC structure resembling the peaks in theXRD pattern, corresponding to (110), (111), (200), and (311) planes; TEM imaging revealed its spherical morphology with an average particle size of 5.85 +/- 0.84 nm ranging from 3.69 to 16.11 nm and Tauc's plot analysis revealed a band gapenergy of 2.22 eV, revealing aptitude of AgNPs as a semiconductors. Thesubsequent characterization results revealed the effective synthesis of silvernanoparticles. The biosynthesized AgNPs were found to have significantantimicrobial effect against three Gram-positive and three Gram-negativebacteria. They also demonstrated higher antioxidative potential by demonstrating strong radical scavenging activity against DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl).AgNPs showed highest anticancer activity (62.69 +/- 1.73%) against human breastcancer (MCF-7) cell line at 100 microg/mL with the IC50 value of 66.07 +/- 2.17microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the prospect for further utilization of AgNPs by Cell free filtrate of Hamigera pallida as an antibacterial,antioxidative and anticancer agents.

AB  - As a highly infectious epidemic in aquaculture, Pseudomonas plecoglossicidainfection results in high mortality of teleosts and serious economic losses.Host-pathogen interactions shape the outcome of an infection, yet we stillunderstand little about the molecular mechanism of these pathogen-mediatedprocesses. Here, a P. plecoglossicida strain (NZBD9) and Epinephelus coioideswere investigated as a model system to characterize pathogen-induced hostmetabolic remodeling over the course of infection. We present a non-targetedmetabolomics profiling of E. coioides spleens from uninfected E. coioides andthose infected with wild-type and clpV-RNA interference (RNAi) strains. The most significant changes of E. coioides upon infection were associated with aminoacids, lysophospatidylcholines, and unsaturated fatty acids, involvingdisturbances in host nutritional utilization and immune responses.Dihydrosphingosine and fatty acid 16:2 were screened as potential biomarkers for assessing P. plecoglossicida infection. The silencing of the P. plecoglossicidaclpV gene significantly recovered the lipid metabolism of infected E. coioides.This comprehensive metabolomics study provides novel insights into how P.plecoglossicida shape host metabolism to support their survival and replicationand highlights the potential of the virulence gene clpV in the treatment of P.plecoglossicida infection in aquaculture.

AB  - Evaluation of RNA-RNA binding is crucial for in vitro studying of molecularmechanisms, for example, the interaction of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with theirrespective targets. In recent years, the method of microscale thermophoresis(MST) has been developed, which is based on the physical phenomenon ofthermophoresis (Ludwig-Soret Effect), defined as the migration of a molecule in asolution in response to a macroscopic temperature gradient. The method enablesthe fast detection and characterization of biophysical interaction betweenmolecules, with the fundamental advantage that only small amounts of target andligand are required. Here, we describe the characterization of RNA-RNA bindingaffinity using the example of the sRNA41 from Methanosarcina mazei and its nativetarget, the 5' UTR of mRNA-MM2089, the first gene of the operon encoding theacetyl-CoA decarboxylase/synthase complex.

AB  - The structure of an RNA molecule is often critical for its correct functioning,post-transcriptional regulation, and/or translation. Predicting RNA secondarystructures with in silico tools is relatively straightforward with the largearray of software and webservers available. However, for long RNAs and RNA athigh temperatures, in silico predictions are less accurate and requireexperimental validation. To this end, a variety of structural probing reagentsare commonly used, both for in vitro and in vivo mapping of RNA structure.Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) experiments make use of a nonbase-specific modifying reagent, acylating all conformationally flexible (mainly single-stranded or unpaired) nucleotides and have been employed both for in vitro and in vivo modification of RNA. Here, we describe a protocolfor an in vitro SHAPE experiment, starting from in vitro transcribed RNA using a T7 polymerase system. This RNA is folded and subsequently modified in vitro with the SHAPE-reagent N-methyl isatoic anhydride (NMIA). Primer extension employing aradioactive (32)P-labeled primer that binds the RNA downstream of the structureof interest will generate cDNA until the reverse transcriptase enzyme is haltedby the introduced SHAPE modifications. Denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pool of (32)P-labeled cDNAs and the corresponding sequencing ladders,followed by autoradiography, will expose these stops in reverse transcription(RT) and will therefore enable to identify single-stranded nucleotides in the RNAof interest. These RT stops and NMIA-modification efficiencies can be quantified with ImageJ software and can be used to validate or increase the accuracy of RNA secondary structure predictions.

AB  - The specificity and strength of protein-DNA complexes rely on tight interactions between side- and main chain atoms of amino acid residues and phosphates, sugars,and base-specific groups. Various (in-gel) footprinting methods (for moreinformation, see Chapter 11 ) allow the identification of the global-bindingregion but do not provide details on the contribution to complex formation ofindividual sequence-specific constituents of the DNA-binding site. Here, wedescribe how various chemicals can be used to randomly and sparingly modifyspecific bases or phosphates and allow the identification of those residues that are specifically protected against modification upon protein binding (protection studies) or interfere with complex formation when modified or removed prior toprotein binding (premodification-binding interference). Each one of thesecomplementary approaches has its advantages and shortcomings and results have to be interpreted with caution, having in mind the precise chemistry of themodification. However, used in combination, these methods provide an accurate andhigh-resolution image of the protein-DNA contacts.

AB  - In-gel footprinting enables the precise identification of protein binding siteson the DNA after separation of free and protein-bound DNA molecules by gelelectrophoresis in native conditions and subsequent digestion by the nucleaseactivity of the 1,10-phenanthroline-copper ion [(OP)2-Cu(+)] within the gelmatrix. Hence, the technique combines the resolving power of protein-DNAcomplexes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with the precisionof target site identification by chemical footprinting. This approach isparticularly well suited to characterize distinct molecular assemblies in amixture of protein-DNA complexes and to identify individual binding sites within composite operators, when the concentration-dependent occupation of bindingsites, with a different affinity, results in the generation of complexes with adistinct stoichiometry and migration velocity in gel electrophoresis.

AB  - In prokaryotes, transcription factors (TFs) are of uttermost importance for theregulation of gene expression. However, the majority of TFs are not characterizedtoday, which hampers both the understanding of fundamental processes and thedevelopment of TF-based applications, such as biosensors, used in metabolicengineering, synthetic biology, diagnostics, etc. One way of analyzing TFs isthrough in vivo screening, enabling the study of TF-promoter interactions, ligandinducibility, and ligand specificity in a high-throughput fashion. Here, anapproach is described for the selection and cloning of TF-promoter pairs, thedevelopment of a reporter system, and the measurement and analysis of fluorescentreporter assays. Furthermore, the importance of a suitable inducible plasmidsystem is illustrated together with prospective adaptations to modify a reporter system's output signal. The given approach can be used for the investigation ofnative, heterologous, or even artificially created TFs in Escherichia coli, andcan be extended toward use in other microorganisms.

AB  - DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in the geneexpression of all organisms, from viruses to humans, including bacteria andarchaea. The role of these proteins is the fate of gene expression in the contextof environmental challenges. Because thousands of genomes have been sequenced to date, predictions of the encoded proteins are validated through the use ofbioinformatics tools to obtain the necessary experimental, posterior knowledge.In this chapter, we describe three approaches to identify TFs in proteinsequences. The first approach integrates the results of sequence comparisons and PFAM assignments, using as reference a manually curated collection of TFs. Thesecond approach considers the prediction of DNA-binding structures, such as theclassical helix-turn-helix (HTH); and the third approach considers a deeplearning model. We suggest that all approaches must be considered together toincrease the possibility of identifying new TFs in bacterial and archaealgenomes.

AB  - Archaeal transcription and its regulation are characterized by a mosaic ofeukaryotic and bacterial features. Molecular analysis of the functioning of thearchaeal RNA polymerase, basal transcription factors, and specificpromoter-containing DNA templates allows to unravel the mechanisms oftranscription regulation in archaea. In vitro transcription is a technique thatallows the study of this process in a simplified and controlled environment less complex than the archaeal cell. In this chapter, we present an in vitrotranscription methodology for the study of transcription in Sulfolobales. It isdescribed how to purify the RNA polymerase and the basal transcription factorsTATA-binding protein and transcription factor B of Saccharolobus solfataricus andhow to perform in vitro transcription reactions and transcript detection.Application of this protocol for other archaeal species could require minormodifications to protein overexpression and purification conditions.

AB  - Gene regulation is an intricate phenomenon involving precise function of manymacromolecular complexes. Molecular basis of this phenomenon is highly complexand cannot be fully understood using a single technique. Computational approachescan play a crucial role in overall understanding of functional and mechanisticfeatures of a protein or an assembly. Large amounts of structural data pertainingto these complexes are publicly available. In this project, we took advantage of the availability of the structural information to unravel functional intricacies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase upon interaction with RbpA. In this article, we discuss how the knowledge on protein structure and dynamics can beexploited to study function using various computational tools and resources.Overall, this article provides an overview of various computational methods whichcan be efficiently used to understand the role of any protein. We hope especiallythe nonexperts in the field could benefit from our article.

AB  - A major goal in synthetic biology is the engineering of synthetic gene circuitswith a predictable, controlled and designed outcome. This creates a need forbuilding blocks that can modulate gene expression without interference with thenative cell system. A tool allowing forward engineering of promoters withpredictable transcription initiation frequency is still lacking. Promoterlibraries specific for sigma(70) to ensure the orthogonality of gene expressionwere built in Escherichia coli and labeled using fluorescence-activated cellsorting to obtain high-throughput DNA sequencing data to train a convolutionalneural network. We were able to confirm in vivo that the model is able to predictthe promoter transcription initiation frequency (TIF) of new promoter sequences. Here, we provide an online tool for promoter design (ProD) in E. coli, which can be used to tailor output sequences of desired promoter TIF or predict the TIF of a custom sequence.

TI  - Detecting DNA Methylations in the Hyperthermoacidophilic Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius Using SMRT Sequencing.
PG  - 39-50
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-2413-5_3 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylations are one of the most well-known epigenetic modifications alongwith histone modifications and noncoding RNAs. They are found at specific sitesalong the DNA in all domains of life, with 5-mC and 6-mA/4-mC beingwell-characterized in eukaryotes and bacteria respectively, and they have notonly been described as contributing to the structure of the double helix itselfbut also as regulators of DNA-based processes such as replication, transcription,and recombination. Different methods have been developed to accurately identifyand/or map methylated motifs to decipher the involvement of DNA methylations inregulatory networks that affect the cellular state.Although DNA methylations havebeen detected along archaeal genomes, their involvement as regulators ofDNA-based processes remains the least known. To highlight the importance of DNAmethylations in the control of key cellular mechanisms and their dynamics inarchaea cells, we have used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Thissequencing technology allows the identification and direct mapping of themethylated motifs along the genome of an organism. In this chapter, we present a step-by-step protocol for detecting DNA methylations in the hyperthermophiliccrenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius using SMRT sequencing. This protocol caneasily be adapted to other prokaryotes.

AB  - The three-dimensional structure of the chromosome is encoded within its sequence and regulates activities such as replication and transcription. This necessitatesthe study of the spatial organization of the chromosome in relation to theunderlying sequence. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques areproximity ligation-based approaches that simplify the three-dimensionalarchitecture of the chromosome into a one-dimensional library of hybrid ligation junctions. Deciphering the information contained in these libraries resolveschromosome architecture in a sequence-specific manner. This chapter describes thepreparation of 3C libraries for bacteria and archaea. It details how thethree-dimensional architecture of local chromatin can be extracted from the 3Clibrary using qPCR (3C-qPCR), and it summarizes the processing of 3C librariesfor next-generation sequencing (3C-Seq) for a study of global chromosomeorganization.

TI  - A balanced gut microbiota is essential to maintain health in captive sika deer.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12111-w [doi]
AB  - Certain animals harbor a high proportion of pathogens, particular the zoonoticpathogens, in their gut microbiome but are usually asymptomic; however, theircarried pathogens may seriously threaten the public health. By understanding how the microbiome overcomes the negative effects of pathogens to maintain hosthealth, we can develop novel solutions to control animal-mediated pathogentransmission including identification and application of beneficial microbes.Here, we analyzed the gut microbiota of 10 asymptomic captive sika deerindividuals by full-length 16S rDNA sequencing. Twenty-nine known pathogenscapable of infecting humans were identified, and the accumulated proportions ofthe identified pathogens were highly variable among individuals (2.33 to 39.94%).The relative abundances of several beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillusand Bifidobacterium, were found to be positively correlated with the relativeabundances of accumulated pathogens. Whole-genome metagenomic analysis revealedthat the beneficial- and pathogenic-associated functions, such as genes involved in the synthesis of short chain fatty acids and virulence factors, were alsopositively correlated in the microbiome, indicating that the beneficial andpathogenic functions were maintained at a relatively balanced ratio. Furthermore,the bacteriophages that target the identified pathogens were found to bepositively correlated with the pathogenic content in the microbiome. Severalhigh-quality genomes of beneficial bacteria affiliated with Lactobacillus andBifidobacterium and bacteriophages were recovered from the metagenomic data.Overall, this study provides novel insights into the interplay between beneficialand pathogenic content to ensure maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome, andalso contributes to discovery of novel beneficial microbes and functions thatcontrol pathogens. KEY POINTS: * Certain asymptomic captive sika deer individualsharbor relatively high amounts of zoonotic pathogens. * The beneficial microbesand the beneficial functions are balanced with the pathogenic contents in the gutmicrobiome. * Several high-quality genomes of beneficial bacteria andbacteriophages are recovered by metagenomics.

AB  - Microorganisms act as both the source and sink of methane, a potent greenhousegas, thus making a significant contribution to the environment as an importantdriver of climate change. The rhizosphere and phyllosphere of plants growing innatural (mangroves) and artificial wetlands (flooded agricultural ecosystems)harbor methane-utilizing bacteria that oxidize methane at the source and reduceits net flux. For several decades, microorganisms have been used asbiofertilizers to promote plant growth. However, now their role in reducing netmethane flux, especially from flooded agricultural ecosystems is gaining momentumglobally. Research in this context has mainly focused on taxonomic aspectsrelated to methanotrophy among diverse bacterial genera, and environmentalfactors that govern methane utilization in natural and artificial wetlandecosystems. In the last few decades, concerted efforts have been made to develop multifunctional microbial inoculants that can oxidize methane and alleviategreenhouse gas emissions, as well as promote plant growth. In this context,combinations of taxonomic groups commonly found in rice paddies and those used asbiofertilizers are being explored. This review deals with methanotrophy amongdiverse bacterial domains, factors influencing methane-utilizing ability, andexplores the potential of novel methane-utilizing microbial consortia with plant growth-promoting traits in flooded ecosystems.

AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to cause significant disease burden. Whilstpneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have substantially reduced this burden,serotype replacement partially negates this success due to increased diseaseassociated with non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs). Continued surveillance is thereforeessential to provide crucial epidemiological data. Annual cross-sectionalsurveillance of paediatric pneumococcal carriage was started in Southampton, UKfollowing PCV7 roll-out in 2006. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected fromchildren < 5 years old each winter (October to March) from 2006/07 and for eachconsecutive year until 2017/18. Pneumococcal serotype was inferred from wholegenome sequencing data. A total of 1429 (32.5%) pneumococci were isolated from4093 children. Carriage ranged from 27.8% (95%CI 23.7-32.7) in 2008/09 to 37.9%(95%CI 32.8-43.2) in 2014/15. Analyses showed that carriage increased in childrenaged 24-35 months (p < 0.001) and 47-60 months (p < 0.05). Carriage of PCVserotypes decreased markedly following PCV7 and/or PCV13 introduction, apart fromserotype 3 where the relative frequency was slightly lower post-PCV13 (pre-PCV13 n = 7, 1.67%; post-PCV13 n = 13, 1.27%). Prevalence of NVTs implicated inincreased disease was low with 24F (n = 19, 1.4%) being the most common followed by 9N (n = 11, 0.8%), 8 (n = 7, 0.5%) and 12F (n = 3, 0.2%).

AB  - Acute respiratory infections are widespread in vulnerable populations of all agesand are characterized by a variety of symptoms. The underlying infection can becaused by a multitude of microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria. Earlydetection of respiratory infections through rapid pathogen screening is vital in averting infectious respiratory disease epidemics. This study utilized amultiplex real-time PCR system to develop a three-tube reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay, enabling simultaneously detect nine respiratory pathogens,including: influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Haemophilus influenzae,Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This technique utilizes aone-step assay, with specifically designed TaqMan primer-probe sets combined inthe same tube. This assay provided rapid and simplified detection of the nineprevalent pathogens, as well as increased sensitivity and reducedcross-contamination. This assay was evaluated using 25 related viral/bacterialstrains as positive references, the other 25 irrelevant strains as negativecontrols, and clinical specimens from 179 patients. All positive strains weredetected with no amplification of the non-target microorganism mixtures and theassay's detection limits ranged between 250-500 copies/ml (1.25-2.5copies/reaction). A total of 167 (93.3%) samples tested positive for at least oneof the pathogens identified; 109 of these samples were from patients confirmed tohave RSV infections. The diagnostic accuracy of our assay was further confirmedby matching results from classical direct immunofluorescence assay and nucleotidesequencing. These data demonstrate the innovative multiplex real-time PCR assayas a promising alternative to the current approaches used for early screening of acute respiratory infections.

TI  - Teixobactin kills bacteria by a two-pronged attack on the cell envelope.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05019-y [doi]
AB  - Antibiotics that use novel mechanisms are needed to combat antimicrobialresistance(1-3). Teixobactin(4) represents a new class of antibiotics with aunique chemical scaffold and lack of detectable resistance. Teixobactin targetslipid II, a precursor of peptidoglycan(5). Here we unravel the mechanism ofteixobactin at the atomic level using a combination of solid-state NMR,microscopy, in vivo assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The uniqueenduracididine C-terminal headgroup of teixobactin specifically binds to thepyrophosphate-sugar moiety of lipid II, whereas the N terminus coordinates thepyrophosphate of another lipid II molecule. This configuration favours theformation of a beta-sheet of teixobactins bound to the target, creating asupramolecular fibrillar structure. Specific binding to the conservedpyrophosphate-sugar moiety accounts for the lack of resistance to teixobactin(4).The supramolecular structure compromises membrane integrity. Atomic forcemicroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the supramolecularstructure displaces phospholipids, thinning the membrane. The long hydrophobictails of lipid II concentrated within the supramolecular structure apparentlycontribute to membrane disruption. Teixobactin hijacks lipid II to help destroythe membrane. Known membrane-acting antibiotics also damage human cells,producing undesirable side effects. Teixobactin damages only membranes thatcontain lipid II, which is absent in eukaryotes, elegantly resolving the toxicityproblem. The two-pronged action against cell wall synthesis and cytoplasmicmembrane produces a highly effective compound targeting the bacterial cellenvelope. Structural knowledge of the mechanism of teixobactin will enable therational design of improved drug candidates.

TI  - Architecture and self-assembly of the jumbo bacteriophage nuclear shell.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05013-4 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria encode myriad defences that target the genomes of infectingbacteriophage, including restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas systems(1). Inresponse, one family of large bacteriophages uses a nucleus-like compartment toprotect its replicating genomes by excluding host defence factors(2-4). However, the principal composition and structure of this compartment remain unknown. Here we find that the bacteriophage nuclear shell assembles primarily from oneprotein, which we name chimallin (ChmA). Combining cryo-electron tomography ofnuclear shells in bacteriophage-infected cells and cryo-electron microscopy of a minimal chimallin compartment in vitro, we show that chimallin self-assembles as a flexible sheet into closed micrometre-scale compartments. The architecture and assembly dynamics of the chimallin shell suggest mechanisms for its nucleationand growth, and its role as a scaffold for phage-encoded factors mediatingmacromolecular transport, cytoskeletal interactions, and viral maturation.

Most cancers use glycolysis to harness energy for their infinite growth, invasion and metastasis(2,7,8).Activation of thermogenic metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT) by cold anddrugs instigates blood glucose uptake in adipocytes(4,5,9). However, thefunctional effects of the global metabolic changes associated with BAT activationon tumour growth are unclear. Here we show that exposure of tumour-bearing miceto cold conditions markedly inhibits the growth of various types of solidtumours, including clinically untreatable cancers such as pancreatic cancers.Mechanistically, cold-induced BAT activation substantially decreases bloodglucose and impedes the glycolysis-based metabolism in cancer cells. The removal of BAT and feeding on a high-glucose diet under cold exposure restore tumourgrowth, and genetic deletion of Ucp1-the key mediator forBAT-thermogenesis-ablates the cold-triggered anticancer effect. In a pilot human study, mild cold exposure activates a substantial amount of BAT in both healthyhumans and a patient with cancer with mitigated glucose uptake in the tumourtissue. These findings provide a previously undescribed concept and paradigm for cancer therapy that uses a simple and effective approach. We anticipate that coldexposure and activation of BAT through any other approach, such as drugs anddevices either alone or in combination with other anticancer therapeutics, willprovide a general approach for the effective treatment of various cancers.

AB  - Pressure-driven membranes is a widely used separation technology in a range ofindustries, such as water purification, bioprocessing, food processing andchemical production(1,2). Despite their numerous advantages, such as modulardesign and minimal footprint, inevitable membrane fouling is the key challenge inmost practical applications(3). Fouling limits membrane performance by reducingpermeate flux or increasing pressure requirements, which results in higherenergetic operation and maintenance costs(4-7). Here we report ahydraulic-pressure-responsive membrane (PiezoMem) to transform pressure pulsesinto electroactive responses for in situ self-cleaning. A transient hydraulicpressure fluctuation across the membrane results in generation of current pulses and rapid voltage oscillations (peak, +5.0/-3.2 V) capable of foulant degradationand repulsion without the need for supplementary chemical cleaning agents,secondary waste disposal or further external stimuli(3,8-13). PiezoMem showedbroad-spectrum antifouling action towards a range of membrane foulants, includingorganic molecules, oil droplets, proteins, bacteria and inorganic colloids,through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and dielectrophoretic repulsion.

TI  - The biofilm life cycle: expanding the conceptual model of biofilm formation.
LID - 10.1038/s41579-022-00767-0 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are often defined as communities of surface-attached bacteria and are typically depicted with a classic mushroom-shaped structurecharacteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, it has become evident thatthis is not how all biofilms develop, especially in vivo, in clinical andindustrial settings, and in the environment, where biofilms often are observed asnon-surface-attached aggregates. In this Review, we describe the origin of thecurrent five-step biofilm development model and why it fails to capture manyaspects of bacterial biofilm physiology. We aim to present a simplisticdevelopmental model for biofilm formation that is flexible enough to include all the diverse scenarios and microenvironments where biofilms are formed. With this new expanded, inclusive model, we hereby introduce a common platform fordeveloping an understanding of biofilms and anti-biofilm strategies that can betailored to the microenvironment under investigation.

TI  - Histone H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 form a chromatin platform essential forDNMT3A-dependent DNA methylation in mouse oocytes.
PG  - 4440
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32141-2 [doi]
AB  - Establishment of the DNA methylation landscape of mammalian oocytes, mediated by the DNMT3A-DNMT3L complex, is crucial for reproduction and development. In mouse oocytes, high levels of DNA methylation occur exclusively in thetranscriptionally active regions, with moderate to low levels of methylation inother regions. Histone H3K36me3 mediates the high levels of methylation in thetranscribed regions; however, it is unknown which histone mark guides themethylation in the other regions. Here, we show that, in mouse oocytes, H3K36me2 is highly enriched in the X chromosome and is broadly distributed across allautosomes. Upon H3K36me2 depletion, DNA methylation in moderately methylatedregions is selectively affected, and a methylation pattern unique to the Xchromosome is switched to an autosome-like pattern. Furthermore, we find thatsimultaneous depletion of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 results in globalhypomethylation, comparable to that of DNMT3A depletion. Therefore, the twohistone marks jointly provide the chromatin platform essential for guidingDNMT3A-dependent DNA methylation in mouse oocytes.

PG  - 4515
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32208-0 [doi]
AB  - A major goal of current HIV-1 vaccine design efforts is to induce broadlyneutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). The VH1-2-derived bNAb IOMA directed to theCD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is of interest because,unlike the better-known VH1-2-derived VRC01-class bNAbs, it does not require arare short light chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRL3). Here, wedescribe three IOMA-class NAbs, ACS101-103, with up to 37% breadth, that sharemany characteristics with IOMA, including an average-length CDRL3. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that ACS101 shares interactions with those observed withother VH1-2 and VH1-46-class bNAbs, but exhibits a unique binding mode toresidues in loop D. Analysis of longitudinal sequences from the patient suggests that a transmitter/founder-virus lacking the N276 glycan might have initiated thedevelopment of these NAbs. Together these data strengthen the rationale forgermline-targeting vaccination strategies to induce IOMA-class bNAbs and provide a wealth of sequence and structural information to support such strategies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is exacting an increasing toll worldwide, with newSARS-CoV-2 variants emerging that exhibit higher infectivity rates and that maypartially evade vaccine and antibody immunity. Rapid deployment of non-invasivetherapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variantscould complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on theCOVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting theSARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs).We identify an LNA ASO binding to the 5' leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 thatdisrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy inpreventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration ofthis LNA ASO in the COVID-19 mouse model potently suppresses viral replication(>80-fold) in the lungs of infected mice. We find that the LNA ASO is efficaciousin countering all SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" tested both in vitro and invivo. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promisingtherapeutic approach to reduce or prevent transmission and decrease severity ofCOVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can beflexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences and could be stockpiledfor future coronavirus pandemics.

AB  - Defective interfering genes (DIGs) are short viral genomes and interfere withwild-type viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the new designedSARS-CoV-2 DIG (CD3600) can significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2including Alpha, Delta, Kappa and Omicron variants in human HK-2 cells andinfluenza DIG (PAD4) can significantly inhibit influenza virus replication inhuman A549 cells. One dose of influenza DIGs prophylactically protects 90% micefrom lethal challenge of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and CD3600 inhibits SARS-CoV-2replication in hamster lungs when DIGs are administrated to lungs one day before viral challenge. To further investigate the gene delivery vector in therespiratory tract, a peptidic TAT2-P1&LAH4, which can package genes to form smallspherical nanoparticles with high endosomal escape ability, is demonstrated todramatically increase gene expression in the lung airway. TAT2-P1&LAH4, with the dual-functional TAT2-P1 (gene-delivery and antiviral), can deliver CD3600 tosignificantly inhibit the replication of Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in hamster lungs. This peptide-based nanoparticle system can effectively transfect genes in lungs and deliver DIGs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants and influenza virus invivo, which provides the new insight into the drug delivery system for genetherapy against respiratory viruses.

TI  - Epidemiological and Immunological Gains from Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS):Fact or Wishful Thinking?
LID - 10.1111/tmi.13807 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is still no consensus on the impact of using solar disinfection (SODIS) to reduce the prevalence of waterborne gastrointestinal diseases. Thereported reduction in diarrhea prevalence among SODIS users has been attributedto the consumption of water free of viable pathogens. However, it has also beensuggested that ingestion of SODIS-inactivated pathogens may induce protectiveimmunological changes that may also contribute to a reduction in the frequency ofdiarrhea. The present study aimed to critically review the epidemiological andimmunological gains of using SODIS. METHODS: We critically reviewed 22 articlespublished in English, selected from 2,118 records systematically retrieved fromthe databases. RESULTS: All trials (except one) reported a significant reduction in diarrhea prevalence among children using SODIS, but some of the data fromtrials report contrary findings. All in vitro and in vivo assays indicate thatSODIS-inactivated pathogenic bacteria have the potential to induce immunological alterations that may result in protective immunological effects. Studies with alow risk of bias are still awaited to confirm the ability of using SODIS toreduce the prevalence of diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Reducing the prevalence ofdiarrhea depends on the success of SODIS delivery strategies in inducingbehavioral changes in communities that result in the production ofSODIS-compliant outcomes. The results of trials reporting a reduction in theprevalence of diarrhea due to the use of SODIS seem to support the hypothesis of the contribution of the protective immunological effect against diarrhea in SODISusers.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.28045 [doi]
AB  - The seroprevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is high inXinjiang, China. But the seroprevalence of KSHV and risk factors are stillunknown in Gansu which is adjacent to Xinjiang. 678 serum samples of generalpopulation and 87 serum samples of syphilis patients from Jiuquan, Gansu weretested for antibodies against KSHV including one latent protein (ORF73) and twolytic proteins (ORF65 and K8.1) using the ELISA. The total KSHV-seropositive ratewas 15.9% in 678 serum samples of Jiuquan area, the KSHV-seropositive rate ofmales was higher than females (18.0% VS 14.6%, P > 0.05). The Uygur, Kazakh, Hui,Manchu and Mongolian population had a higher seroprevalence of KSHV than the Han population (43.8%, 40.0%, 34.5%, 30.3%, 35.0% VS 11.0%, respectively) among theethnic groups in Jiuquan. Compared to the Han, Uygur, Kazak, Hui, Manchu andMongolian people had an increase in the risk of KSHV of 528.9%, 439.1%, 325.6%,251.6%, 335.4% (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.003,respectively). The serum prevalence of KSHV in subjects aged < 20 years, 20-50years and > 50 years was 13.8%, 14.7% and 20.1%, respectively. Compared to thesubjects aged < 20 years, 20-50 years and > 50 years had an increase in the risk of KSHV of 7.4% and 56.9% (P = 0.829 and P = 0.204, respectively). Compared tothe positive rate of KSHV in the general population of Anhui, the positive rateof KSHV was significantly higher in the general population of Jiuquan area (15.9%VS 9%, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the positive rate ofKSHV between the Han population of Jiuquan and the Han population of Anhui (P >0.05). In the population of syphilis patients of Jiuquan area, the positive rate of KSHV was 30.7%, which was higher than that of the general population in Gansu area (P < 0.05). This study indicates that Gansu has a high seroprevalence ofKSHV. Ethnicity and syphilis are risk factors for KSHV infection. This article isprotected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we present a surface decontamination system that substitutestraditional chemicals and scrubbing agents, which will be useful for the general public during a pandemic. The technique is based on a hybrid process in whichUV-C light and its photons interact with metal oxide nano-catalysts to generatehydroxyl radicals, which can enhance the deactivation process, and the system canwork even in the shadow regions via a dry process. The optimum number of UV lightsources in combination with TiO2 nanoparticles catalysts on aluminum plates have been used synergistically in the system. The UV dose in the disinfection chamber has been optimized, which is between 60 and 500 mJ/cm(2) throughout thedisinfection chamber. The concentration of hydroxyl radicals is reported morethan 25 000 ions/cm(3) within the disinfection chamber. These ions are circulatedthroughout the disinfection volume. The disinfection efficiency has been testedon bacteria and spores, and the obtained results are correlated. Around 8 logreductions in the counts of the test bacteria of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have been achieved in just 2 min of exposure in the continuousoperation of the system. Tests have also been performed on Geobacillusstearothermophilus spores, and the method described here is the result ofmultiple tests, a review of the scientific literature, and the incorporation ofcurrent laboratory practice. The deactivation tested in the system is larger thanthat of known bacteria and viruses in terms of UV-doses, signifying its utilityduring the pandemic.

TI  - New antimicrobial peptide-antibiotic combination strategy for Pseudomonasaeruginosa inactivation.
PG  - 041002
LID - 10.1116/6.0001981 [doi]
AB  - Novel antimicrobials or new treatment strategies are urgently needed to treatPseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) related infections and especially toaddress the problem of antibiotic resistance. We propose a novel strategy thatcombines the human antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL37 with different antibiotics tofind synergistic AMP-antibiotic combinations against P. aeruginosa strains invitro. Our results showed that LL37 exhibited synergistic inhibitory andbactericidal effects against P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA103 when combinedwith the antibiotics vancomycin, azithromycin, polymyxin B, and colistin. Inaddition, LL37 caused strong outer membrane permeabilization, as demonstratedthrough measurement of an increased uptake of the fluorescent probeN-phenyl-1-naphthylamine. The membrane permeabilization effects appear to explainwhy it was easier to rescue the effectiveness of the antibiotic toward thebacteria because the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa exhibits barrier functionfor antibiotics. Furthermore, the change in the zeta potential was measured forP. aeruginosa strains with the addition of LL37. Zeta potentials for P.aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA103 were -40.9 and -10.9 mV, respectively. With theaddition of LL37, negative zeta potentials were gradually neutralized. We foundthat positively charged LL37 can interact with and neutralize the negativelycharged bacterial outer membrane through electrostatic interactions, and theprocess of neutralization is believed to have contributed to the increase inouter membrane permeability. Finally, to further illustrate the relationshipbetween outer membrane permeabilization and the uptake of antibiotics, we usedLL37 to make the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa strains more permeable, andminimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for several antibiotics (colistin,gentamicin, polymyxin B, vancomycin, and azithromycin) were measured. The MICsdecreased were twofold to fourfold, in general. For example, the MICs ofazithromycin and vancomycin decreased more than fourfold when against P.aeruginosa strain PAO1, which were the greatest decrease of any of theantibiotics tested in this experiment. As for PA103, the MIC of polymyxin B2decreased fourfold, which was the strongest decrease seen for any of theantibiotics tested in this experiment. The increased uptake of antibiotics notonly demonstrates the barrier role of the outer membrane but also validates themechanism of synergistic effects that we have proposed. These results indicatethe great potential of an LL37-antibiotic combination strategy and providepossible explanations for the mechanisms behind this synergy.

AB  - There is a rare case of an elderly diabetic with diabetic foot infection atHainan General Hospital in September 2021, which was diagnosed as Corynebacteriumdiphtheriae infection incidentally on routine culture with conventional methodsand molecular biological approaches, to aid in diagnosis in clinical practice.Owing to smear staining, Albert staining and VITEK 2 system, automatedidentification systems viz matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time offlight (MALDI-TOF) confirmed combing with 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene hasbeen used for the taxonomic classification of bacteria. Otherwise, toxin gene toxwas done for diphtheria toxin synthesis. The isolate was Gram-stain-positive,rod-like arrangement with irregular thickness, with characteristic metachromatic granules, ferment most sugars and homology of 16S rRNA analyses with C.diphtheriae NCTC11397(T) (MW682323.1) was greater than a 100% possibility, toxin gene tox was negative. The findings lay the foundation to clinical identify andtrace of non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Moreover, this work provides insights intothe non-toxigenic C.diphtheriae that contribute to recognized risk ofnon-toxigenic C.diphtheriae infections.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the application value of Metagenomic Next-Generationsequencing (mNGS) in infectious patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem celltransplantation(allo-HSCT). Methods: Patients suspected with local or systemicinfections were retrospectively included after allo-HSCT in our department fromApril 2019 to November 2020. Pathogenic microorganisms were tested by mNGS insamples from peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, alveolar lavage Liquid,abscess, etc. Other diagnostic methods such as bacterial/fungal culture, viralPCR detection were simultaneously explored comparing with mNGS results. Results: A total of 112 samples in 83 patients were detected by mNGS, and 34 pathogenicmicroorganisms were determined. Among these positive samples, 11 strains ofbacteria (17 times) with the most common Escherichia coli (4/17) were reported.There were 7 strains of fungi (10 times) detected with primary Candida albicans(7/29). Although arvovirus 30.2% (39/129) were predominantly detected, itsdiagnostic relevance with infections was not definite. Other pathogenic virusesincluding cytomegalovirus (CMV) 25.6% (33/129) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) 14.0%(18/129)were of significance. Comparing with golden diagnostic criteria, thesensitivity of mNGS was 86.5%, and specificity was 45.0%. Regarding singlepathogen infection, the consistency of mNGS and conventional methods was 82.9%(29/35), while it was 16/17 in combination infections. Conclusion: mNGS could be a potential method to determine pathogens in patients suspected with infectionsafter allo-HSCT.

AB  - Objective: To explore the value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the etiology diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in children. Methods: Theetiological results of 189 children diagnosed with "bacterial meningitis" or"purulent meningitis" or "central nervous system infection" in the Children'sHospital of Fudan University from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2020 wereanalyzed retrospectively. The cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) of the children withbacterial meningitis was detected by culture and mNGS respectively, and thedifference of pathogen detection rate between the 2 methods was analyzed.According to the age at the time of visit, the children were divided intoneonatal group (</=28 days of age) and non-neonatal group (>28 days of age), and chi(2) test was used to compare the positive rate between the 2 groups. TakingCFS culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of mNGS in the diagnosing of bacterial meningitis in children were analyzed. Results: Amongthese 189 children with bacterial meningitis, 116 were males and 73 were females.A total of 76 strains of pathogens were detected in blood and (or) CSF cultures, of which 50 strains (65.8%) were Gram-positive bacteria; among those, 18 strains (23.7%) of Streptococcus agalactiae, 17 strains (19.7%) of Escherichia coli and15 strains (19.7%) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected with higherdetection rate. The infection rate of Gram-positive bacteria in the non-neonatal group was higher than that in the neonatal group (76.0% (38/50) vs. 50.0%(13/26), chi(2)=5.24, P=0.020).The same CSF samples of 48 cases were tested bymNGS and culture at the same time, and the detection rate of mNGS was higher thanthat of CSF culture (20 cases (41.7%) vs. 12 cases (25.0%), chi(2)=16.45,P<0.001). The consistency of mNGS and culture results was 79.2% (38/48), and the same pathogen was detected in 11 children with both positive mNGS and CSFculture. Taking the results of CSF culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity of mNGS in the diagnosing of bacterial meningitis was 91.7%, and the specificity was 75.0%. Conclusions: The mNGS technology can improve the pathogen detectionrate of bacterial meningitis in children, and has a high consistency with CSFculture. In suspected cases where the pathogen cannot be identified bytraditional methods, CSF mNGS should be considered timely.

AB  - Objective: To understand the risk factors and antibiotics-resistant patterns ofinvasive Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Children. Methods: Thisretrospective study was conducted in 6 tertiary hospitals from January 2016 toDecember 2018. The basic information, clinical data and the results ofantimicrobial susceptibility testing were collected from the 98 pediatricinpatients with Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from blood or cerebrospinalfluid and analyzed. According to the susceptibility of the infected strains tocarbapenems, they were divided into carbapenem-sensitive Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB) group and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) group.According to the possible sources of infection, they were divided into nosocomialinfection group and community infection group. Chi-square test or Fisher exacttest were used to analyze categorical variables and rank sum test were used toanalyze continuous variables. The risk factors of invasive CRAB infection inchildren were analyzed by Logistic regression. Result: There were 56 males and 42females in 98 cases. The onset age of patients was 8 (2, 24) months. There were62 cases (63%) from rural area. A total of 87 cases (89%) were confirmed withbloodstream infection, and 12 cases (12%) confirmed with meningitis (1 case wasaccompanied with bloodstream infection). In these patients, 66 cases (67%)received invasive medical procedures or surgery, 54 cases (55%) receivedcarbapenems-containing therapy. Twenty-four cases were infected with CRAB, and 74cases with CSAB. The onset age of cases in CRAB group was lower than that in CSABgroup (4 (1, 9) vs. 10 (4, 24) months, Z=-2.16, P=0.031). The proportions ofhospitalization in intensive care unit, carbapenem antibiotics using, pneumoniaand adverse prognosis in CRAB group were higher than those in CSAB group (6 cases(25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), 18 cases (75%) vs. 36 cases (49%), 17 cases (71%) vs. 17 cases (23%), 6 cases (25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), chi(2)=5.61, 5.09, 18.32, 5.61, all P<0.05). Seventy-seven cases were nosocomial infection and 21 cases werehospital-acquired infection. The proportion of children hospitalized in high-riskwards for nosocomial infections, length of hospitalization, number ofantimicrobial therapy received and duration of antimicrobial therapy were higher in the hospital associated infection group than those in the community acquiredinfection group (all P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that childrenfrom rural area (OR=8.42, 95%CI 1.45-48.88), prior mechanical ventilation(OR=12.62, 95%CI 1.31-121.76), and prior antibiotic therapy (OR=4.90, 95%CI1.35-17.72) were independent risk factors for CRAB infection. The resistancepercentage of CSAB isolates to many classes of antibiotics was <6% except togentamicin, which was as high as 20% (13/65). All CRAB isolates of resistant toampicillin-sulbactam (20/20), cefepime (23/23), piperacillin (17/17), meropenem(23/23) and imipenem (24/24) were 100%. The resistance percentage to otherantibiotics were up to 42%-96%. Conclusions: Most of invasive Acinetobacterbaumannii infection in children in China are hospital-acquired. The outcome ofinvasive CRAB infection was poorer than that of CSAB infection. The drugresistance rate of CRAB strains isolated is high. Living in rural area, priorinvasive mechanical ventilation and prior antibiotic therapy were independentrisk factors for invasive CRAB infection. The prevention and control ofnosocomial infection and appropriate use of antibiotics to reduce Acinetobacterbaumannii infection.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria,complications and risk factors of prognosis of acute hematogenous osteomyelitisin children. Methods: The clinical manifestations, laboratorg tests, etiological charateristics and clinical data of 107 patients with acute hematogenousosteomyelitis admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital from January 2017 toDecember 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the drug sensitivityresults of Staphylococcus aureus, the group was divided intomethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptibleStaphylococcus aureus (MSSA) group; according to the presence or absence ofcomplications, the group was divided into the group with and withoutcomplications; according to the prognosis of the follow-up children, the groupwas divided into good prognosis and poor prognosis. The chi(2) test orMann-Whitney U test used for comparison between groups, and Logistic regressionwas used to analyze the risk factors for complications and prognosis. Results: Ofthe 107 patients, 62 were males and 45 were females. The age of presentation was 5.6 (1.7, 10.0) years, including 5 patients (4.7%) age from >28 days to 3 months,46 patients (43.0%) age from >3 months to 5 years, 43 patients (40.2%)>5-12 yearsof age, and 13 patients (12.1%)>12-18 years of age. The first symptoms were acutefever in 35 patients (32.7%), limb pain in 24 patients (22.4%), and fever withlimb pain in 23 patients (21.5%). Pathogen culture was positive in 75 patients(70.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli in 1case (1.4%) each, and Staphylococcus aureus in 72 cases (96.0%), among them, 47cases were MSSA, 22 cases were MRSA, and 3 cases had positive reports ofStaphylococcus aureus from other hospitals without drug-sensitive tests. Theproportion of infected children living in rural areas and receiving surgicaltreatment was higher in the MRSA group than in the MSSA group (14 cases (63.6%)vs. 18 cases (38.3%) and 21 cases (95.5%) vs. 33 cases (70.2%), chi(2)=3.87,4.23, both P<0.05). Sixty-five children had no complications while 42 children(39.3%) suffered from complications. Common complications consisted of 19 cases(17.8%) of sepsis, 17 cases (15.9%) of septic arthritis, and 12 cases (11.2%) of venous thrombosis. The group with complications showed higher mental changes,decreased appetite and (or) weakness, positive pathogenic cultures, and time fromadmission to surgery than the group without complications (18 cases (42.9%) vs. 9cases (13.8%), 20 cases (47.6%) vs. 12 cases (18.5%), 34 cases (81.0%) vs. 41cases (63.1%), 3.5 (2.0, 6.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0, 4.0) d,chi(2)=11.38, 10.35, 3.89,Z=2.21, all P<0.05). The poor prognosis group had more comorbidities, combinedlocal complications, and positive aureus than the good prognosis group (10/15 vs.34.9% (30/86), 7/15 vs. 17.4% (15/86), 14/15 vs. 61.6% (53/86), chi(2)=5.39,6.40, 4.42, all P<0.05). Multifactorial Logistic regression analysis showed that acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) was both an independent risk factor forcomplications (OR=1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02) and an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (OR=1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.02). Conclusions: The first symptoms of acutehematogenous osteomyelitis are acute fever, limb pain, and fever with limb painare most common. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism.Those with loss of appetite and (or) weakness, mental changes, positivepathogenic cultures, and longer time between admission and surgery are prone tocomplications. Those with complications, combined local complications, andpositive for Staphylococcus aureus had a poor prognosis. Elevated CRP is anindependent risk factor not only for complications but for poor prognosis aswell.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological features of early gastriccancers after Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. Methods: The clinical data of 26 cases of gastric cancer that were diagnosed after H. pylorieradication and 45 cases without H. pylori eradication in the 989 Hospital of theJoint Logistics Support Force of the People's Liberation Army (the former 152Hospital), Pingdingshan, China from 2013 to 2021 were collected. Thehistological, immunophenotypic and clinical characteristics of the two groupswere compared, and discussed with review of the related literature. Results:Among the gastric cancer patients with H. pylori eradication, there were 20 malesand 6 females with a median age of 65 years (range 53 to 77 years). The cancerinvolved the upper part of the stomach in 12 cases, the middle part of thestomach in 4 cases, and the lower part of the stomach in 10 cases. The mediandiameter of the tumors was 12 mm (range 4-29 mm). According to the ParisClassification, 4 cases were 0-a, 4 cases were 0-b, 18 cases were 0-c. Whitelight endoscopy showed that the lesions were reddish to yellowish. The lesionboundary was clear in 12 cases and was unclear or gastritis-like changes in 14cases, while the irregular microvascular structure and microsurface structure, aswell as the relatively visible spinous boundary, were visible under narrow-bandimaging. There were 20 cases of well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, 4cases of highly to moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, and 2 cases of well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with papillary adenocarcinoma.Compared with gastric cancers without H. pylori eradication, gastric cancersdiagnosed after H. pylori eradication was associated with lower nucleus-cytoplasmratio (<50%), normal epithelial coverage on the cancer surface, mild atypicalepithelial coverage on the cancer surface, elongation of non-cancerous glands in the cancer tissue and subepithelial progression of cancerous glands were higher(P<0.05). The cellular immunophenotypes were gastric type in 6 cases, intestinal type in 4 cases and gastrointestinal mixed type in 16 cases. Conclusions: Theearly gastric cancers diagnosed after H. pylori eradication are more subtleclinically and mostly well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. The importantmorphological features of gastric cancer diagnosed after H. pylori eradicationare decreased cytological atypia and overlying normal epithelium or mildlyatypical epithelium of the cancer. Understanding and recognizing thesemorphological features are helpful to make correct endoscopic and pathologicaldiagnoses.

TI  - COINCIDENCE OF IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION AND LEBER HEREDITARY OPTICNEUROPATHY. A CASE REPORT.
PG  - 197-204
LID - 10.31348/2022/18 [doi]
AB  - GOAL: This paper describes a case of a long-term monitoring of a patient withoptic nerve swelling on the ocular background (papilledema), accompanied bysymptoms of intracranial hypertension, on whom a genetic examination wasperformed as part of differential diagnosis, confirming Leber Hereditary OpticNeuropathy with the m.3460G&gt;A mutation. Casuistry: During the examination of a5-year-old patient after an alleged head injury at a bouncy castle, an opticnerve papilla with unclear boundaries was described on the ocular background ofboth eyes. Neurological examination, including brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging, was indicated to rule out possible intracranial hypertension. Both examinationsyielded a finding within the norm. After eight years of regular follow-up, thepatient attended to our clinic with acute problems in terms of sudden visualimpairment during baseball training. The performed eye examination revealed adeterioration of the vision of the right eye on counting fingers to 50 cm, visionof the left eye to 0.4 naturally, a slowed photoreaction of the right pupil,prominent optic nerve papilla with unclear boundaries on both eyes, dilated andmore coiled vessels with a crossing phenomenon, the retinal periphery shows nofocal changes. Due to the swelling of the papilla, acute deterioration of thevision and the suspected intracranial hypertension, the patient was immediatelyreferred for neurological examination and subsequent hospitalization. There, the patient underwent computer tomography of the brain, venography of the duralvenous sinuses and an initial laboratory examination that showed no pathology.There was increasing headache, nausea and vomiting throughout the period. Alumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure before samplingwas 285 mmH2O and 100 mmH2O after sampling. The biochemistry of the fluid wasnormal with negative microbiology. Evoked visual potentials had bilaterallyprolonged latencies, which corresponds to optic nerve compression. Anophthalmological examination ruled out a drusen papilla. Using Optical Coherence Tomography, a 600 &#956;m edema was detected. The patient underwent two relievinglumbar punctures, which led to a subjective improvement without objectiveimprovement. Finally, the neurosurgeon referred the patient forventriculoperitoneal drainage. Due to the impaired vision and lack of response tothe therapy induced, a genetic test was performed, which confirmed LeberHereditary Optic Neuropathy with the mutation of m.3460G&gt;A. CONCLUSION:Despite the substantially improved identification of the Leber Hereditary OpticNeuropathy, the diagnosis may still be significantly delayed. The variability of initial findings, the rare incidence of the disease and few well-defined symptomsof the disease lead to significant diagnostic difficulties and late commencement of treatment. It is not possible to say whether there was a coincidence of IIHand LHON or whether the signs of IIH are a possible concomitant of the acutephase of LHON.

TI  - Imagining a post-antibiotic era: a cultural analysis of crisis and antibioticresistance.
LID - medhum-2022-012409 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/medhum-2022-012409 [doi]
AB  - The study presented in this article is about the role played by imagination when national and international organisations convey the idea of a dystopian crisisinvolved in the real transition to a postantibiotic era. The present is an erathat can be defined as a time when no new antibiotics are discovered ordeveloped, and existing antibiotics simultaneously become less effective sincebacteria develop resistance against the active substances. Today, antibioticresistance is an international fact; thousands of people die every year in Europeand the USA as a result of bacteria that have become resistant. Then, imaginationcan conjure up a different and a much more dystopian future. This article stemsfrom a public debate concerning the global increase of antibiotic resistance; andwill examine how the concept of fantasy and imagination is central in picturingsuch a future crisis in society. The article's empirical basis mainly consists ofreports from global and Swedish organisations, dating from the 1990s and onwards.These fantasies show that our society has a strong urge to always try tounderstand and explain present time and to identify how 'our' era relates to the past as well as the future. The concept of crisis plays an important role inthese fantasies, it is key to use it when thinking about change. The analysisbuilds on texts and illustrations from global organisations like the WHO and alsonational authorities in Sweden that aim to convey the science behind thechallenge. The aim is to develop a theoretical and empirical understanding, from the perspective of cultural analysis, of how fantasy and crisis are linked whenthe future is conceived.

TI  - Development and validation of an early warning score to identify COVID-19 in the emergency department based on routine laboratory tests: a multicentrecase-control study.
PG  - e059111
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identifying patients with a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in theemergency department (ED) is challenging. Symptoms differ, incidence rates varyand test capacity may be limited. As PCR-testing all ED patients is neitherfeasible nor effective in most centres, a rapid, objective, low-cost earlywarning score to triage ED patients for a possible infection is developed.DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary hospitals in theNetherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients presenting to the ED with venous blood sampling from July 2019 to July 2020 (n=10 417, 279SARS-CoV-2-positive). The temporal validation cohort covered the period from July2020 to October 2021 (n=14 080, 1093 SARS-CoV-2-positive). The externalvalidation cohort consisted of patients presenting to the ED of three hospitalsin the Netherlands (n=12 061, 652 SARS-CoV-2-positive). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary outcome was one or more positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results within 1day prior to or 1 week after ED presentation. RESULTS: The resulting'CoLab-score' consists of 10 routine laboratory measurements and age. The scoreshowed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.930, 95% CI 0.909 to 0.945). Thelowest CoLab-score had high sensitivity for COVID-19 (0.984, 95% CI 0.970 to0.991; specificity: 0.411, 95% CI 0.285 to 0.520). Conversely, the highest score had high specificity (0.978, 95% CI 0.973 to 0.983; sensitivity: 0.608, 95% CI0.522 to 0.685). The results were confirmed in temporal and external validation. CONCLUSIONS: The CoLab-score is based on routine laboratory measurements and isavailable within 1 hour after presentation. Depending on the prevalence, COVID-19may be safely ruled out in over one-third of ED presentations. Highly suspectcases can be identified regardless of presenting symptoms. The CoLab-score iscontinuous, in contrast to the binary outcome of lateral flow testing, and canguide PCR testing and triage ED patients.

LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnac063 [doi]
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide used in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). However, the development of daptomycin-resistantVREfm challenges the treatment of nosocomial VREfm infections. Resistancemechanisms of daptomycin are not fully understood. Here we analysed the genomicchanges leading to a daptomycin-susceptible VREfm isolate becoming resistantafter 50 days of daptomycin and linezolid combination therapy. Seven isogenicVREfm isolates from the same patient (daptomycin-susceptible anddaptomycin-resistant) were analysed using Illumina whole genome sequencing, andtwo isolates were further characterised with Nanopore sequencing. Onenonsynonymous SNP in the rpoC gene previously shown to harbour mutations indaptomycin-resistant VREfm was identified in the daptomycin-resistant isolates.Whole genome comparative analysis identified the loss of a 46.5 kb fragment,duplication of a 29.7 kb fragment, and integration of two plasmids uponacquisition of daptomycin resistance. Transmission electron microscopy showedsimilar alterations in cell morphology and cell wall structure as have previouslybeen described in daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.

PG  - 2100626
LID - 10.1080/15592324.2022.2100626 [doi]
AB  - An endophytic Pseudomonas fluorescens (BsEB-1) was obtained from the roots ofBletilla striata. We investigated its growth-promoting properties and observedthe impact of its inoculation on both the growth and polysaccharide content ofBletilla striata tubers. It was found that BsEB-1 possessed threegrowth-promoting activities: phosphate-solubilizing, produced indoleacetic acid(IAA) and siderophores, but had no nitrogen-fixing activity. BsEB-1 could rapidlyattach to the root hairs of Bletilla striata tissue culture seedlings andendophytically colonize the region of maturation in the roots. It alsosignificantly promoted the rooting and transplant survival rate of the seedlings,as well as the growth and expansion of the tubers, but did not increase theirpolysaccharide content. Pseudomonas fluorescens BsEB-1 exhibits potential forapplications in the artificial planting of Bletilla striata.

TI  - Delta-like 4-Derived Notch Signals Differentially Regulate Thymic Generation ofSkin-Homing CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) Innate Lymphoid Cells at Neonatal and Adult Stages.

AB  - The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ for T cell development. Increasingevidence found that the thymus is also an important site for development ofinnate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs generated in thymi acquire unique homingproperties that direct their localization into barrier tissues such as the skinand intestine, where they help local homeostasis. Mechanisms underlying thedevelopmental programming of unique tissue-homing properties of ILCs are poorlyunderstood. We report in this article that thymic stroma-derived Notch signaling is differentially involved in thymic generation of a population of NK1.1(+) group1 ILCs (ILC1s) with the CCR10(+) skin-homing property in adult and neonatal mice.We found that thymic generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s is increased in Tcell-deficient mice at adult, but not neonatal, stages, supporting the notionthat a large number of developing T cells interfere with signals required forgeneration of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s. In an in vitro differentiation assay,increasing Notch signals promotes generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s fromhematopoietic progenitors. Knockout of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 in thymicstroma impairs generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s in adult thymi, butdevelopment of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s in neonatal thymi is less dependent onDelta-like 4-derived Notch signals. Mechanistically, the Notch signaling isrequired for proper expression of the IL-7R CD127 on thymic NK1.1(+) ILC1s, anddeficiency of CD127 also impairs thymic generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s atadult, but not perinatal, stages. Our findings advanced understanding ofregulatory mechanisms of thymic innate lymphocyte development.

TI  - CRISPR Activation Screening Identifies VGLL3-TEAD1-RUNX1/3 as a TranscriptionalComplex for PD-L1 Expression.
LID - ji2100917 [pii]
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100917 [doi]
AB  - The PD-L1/2-PD-1 immune checkpoint is essential for the proper induction ofperipheral tolerance and limits autoimmunity, whereas tumor cells exploit theirexpression to promote immune evasion. Many different cell types express PD-L1/2, either constitutively or upon stimulation, but the factors driving thisexpression are often poorly defined. In this study, using genome-wide CRISPRactivation screening, we identified three factors that upregulate PD-L1expression: GATA2, MBD6, and transcription cofactor vestigial-like protein 3(VGLL3). VGLL3 acts as a transcriptional regulator, and its expression inducedPD-L1 in many different cell types. Conversely, loss of VGLL3 impairedIFN-gamma-induced PD-L1/2 expression in human keratinocytes. Mechanistically, by performing a second screen to identify proteins acting in concert with VGLL3, we found that VGLL3 forms a complex with TEAD1 and RUNX1/3 to drive expression ofPD-L1/2. Collectively, our work identified a new transcriptional complexcontrolling PD-L1/2 expression and suggests that VGLL3, in addition to its known role in the expression of proinflammatory genes, can balance inflammation byupregulating the anti-inflammatory factors PD-L1 and PD-L2.

TI  - Second-Generation Escherichia coli SuptoxR Strains for High-Level RecombinantMembrane Protein Production.
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.1c00598 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli is one of the most widely utilized hosts for recombinant proteinproduction, including that of membrane proteins (MPs). We have recentlyengineered a specialized E. coli strain for enhanced recombinant MP production,termed SuptoxR. By appropriately co-expressing the effector gene rraA, SuptoxRcan suppress the high toxicity, which is frequently observed during theMP-overexpression process, and, at the same time, enhance significantly thecellular accumulation of membrane-incorporated and properly folded recombinantMP. The combination of these two beneficial effects results in dramaticallyenhanced volumetric yields for various prokaryotic and eukaryotic MPs. Here, weengineered second-generation SuptoxR strains with further improved properties, sothat they can achieve even higher levels of recombinant MP production. Wesearched for naturally occurring RraA variants with similar or improved MPtoxicity-suppressing and production-promoting effects to that of the native E.coli RraA of the original SuptoxR strain. We found that the RraA proteins fromProteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii can be even more potent enhancers ofMP productivity than the E. coli RraA. By exploiting these two newly identifiedRraAs, we constructed two second-generation SuptoxR strains, termed SuptoxR2.1and SuptoxR2.2, whose MP-production capabilities often surpass those of theoriginal SuptoxR significantly. SuptoxR2.1 and SuptoxR2.2 are expected to become widely useful expression hosts for recombinant MP production in bacteria.

TI  - Coronaviruses exploit a host cysteine-aspartic protease for replication.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05148-4 [doi]
AB  - Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1,2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)(3), and SARS-CoV-1(4) vary in their transmissibility andpathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantialapoptosis in cell culture(5-7) and in patient tissues(8-10), suggesting apotential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstratethat caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating Nfragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virusreplication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves thesurvival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoVMA)-infected human DPP4 knock-in(hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a componentof the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication.

AB  - For the first time, the present review critically evaluates biodegradable polymermatrix composites containing graphene-related materials (GRMs) for antibacterial applications while discussing their development, processing routes, mechanicalproperties, and antibacterial activity. Due to its suitable biological propertiesand processability, chitosan has been the most widely used biodegradable polymer for the fabrication of GRM-containing composites with antibacterial properties.The majority of biodegradable polymers (including cellulose-, gelatine-, PVA-,PCL-, and PHA-based polymers) exhibit little to no antibacterial effect alone;however, they show significant antibacterial activity (>70%) when combined withGRMs. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that GRMs functionalization withbiodegradable polymers also reduces potential GRM cytotoxicity. Overall, GRMs in biodegradable polymer matrices provide attractive antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria (>30 different bacteria) along with improvedmechanical properties over pristine polymers, where the type and the degree ofimprovement provided by GRMs depend on the specific matrix. For example, theaddition of GRMs into chitosan, PVA, and PCL matrices increases their tensilestrength by 80%, 180%, and 40%, respectively. Challenges remain in understanding the effects of processing routes and post-processing methods on the antibacterialactivity and biocompatibility of biodegradable polymer/GRM composites. Giventheir promising properties and functionality, research on these composites isexpected to further increase along with the implementation of new compositesystems. These would include a wide range of applications, e.g., wound dressings,tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensing, and photo-thermal therapy, as wellas non-medical use, e.g., antibacterial food packaging, water treatment, andantibacterial fabrics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: : Graphene-related materials(GRMs) in polymer matrices can provide excellent antibacterial activity against abroad spectrum of bacteria together with improved mechanical properties (e.g.,tensile strength and elastic modulus) over pristine polymers; thus, researchefforts and applications of biodegradable polymer matrix composites containingGRMs have increased notably in the last ten years. For the first time, thepresent review critically evaluates biodegradable polymer matrix compositescontaining GRMs for antibacterial applications while discussing theirdevelopment, processing routes, mechanical properties, and antibacterialactivity. Future research directions for each composite system are proposed toshed light on overcoming the existing challenges in composite performance (e.g., mechanical properties, toxicity) reported in the literature.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a common anaerobic foodborne pathogen known to produce>20 toxins. In nature, this bacterium has 7 different toxinotypes (A-G) based on the presence of its 6 main toxins. The present study examined the occurrence ofdifferent toxinotypes of this bacterium in the ichthyofauna and aquaticenvironments of Kashmir Himalayan lakes, India. A total of 510 samples (210water; 150 each of common carp and snow trout) were collected from 3 differentlacustrine habitats (Dal, Anchar and Nigeen Lakes) of the region. By performing16S rRNA PCR test, it was observed that all 210 water samples and 80 (26.66%) of 300 fish samples tested for this specific bacterial species were positive. Thenby using multiplex-PCR targeting six virulence genes of C. perfringens, it wasconfirmed that all the 290 isolates from water and fish samples were positive forToxinotype A, as only cpa toxin gene was amplified. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplified gene and its amino-acid sequences revealed 95%-98% homology withanalogous sequences of this bacterial strain reported from China, Egypt andIndia. The study documents the existence of C. perfringens toxinotype A in theichthyofauna of Kashmiri Himalayan lakes, entailing that fish can likely act astransmission medium for C. perfringens food poisoning to humans via food.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are at a high risk for the inflow and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens. However, owing to limitedlaboratory resources, little is known about the extent to which AMR organisms areendemic. METHODS: We performed active surveillance for carbapenem-resistantEnterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producingEnterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) in newly admitted patients at Marugame MedicalCenter, a nearly 200-bedded LTCH located in Kagawa, Japan. From August toDecember 2021, we tested stool samples from patients wearing diapers andconfirmed the genetic variants using specific PCR assays. We also collectedclinical variables and compared them between AMR carriers and non-carriers.RESULTS: Stool samples were collected from 75 patients, with a median age of 84years. CRE strain was not detected, but 37 strains of ESBL-E were isolated from32 patients (42.7%). During the study period, 4.9% of in-hospital patients (37per 756 patients) were identified to be ESBL-E carriers in the routinemicrobiological processing, suggesting that active surveillance detectedapproximately 9-fold more ESBL-E carriers. The blaCTX-M-9 group was the mostcommon (38.5%), followed by the blaTEM (26.9%). The clinical backgrounds of theESBL-E non-carriers and carriers were not significantly different. CONCLUSION:Our active screening demonstrated that nearly half of the patients hospitalizedor transferred to a Japanese LTCH were colonized with ESBL-E. We highlight theenforcement of universal basic infection prevention techniques at LTCHs wherepatients carrying AMR pathogens gather.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an infectious disease caused byBartonella henselae. CSD follows a typical course, characterized by regionallymphadenopathy. In atypical CSD, the lesions spread to systemic organs and cancause fever of unknown origin (FUO). A previous study showed the usefulness ofwhole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) without diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI) in the diagnosis of FUO, but there are no studies on the clinical utilityof whole-body DWI (WB-DWI). We herein report the case of an immunocompetent youngman in whom contrast-enhanced CT-unidentifiable multiple liver abscess andosteomyelitis were successfully detected by WB-DWI. Follow up with a liver biopsyhelped confirm an atypical CSD diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-oldpreviously healthy man was admitted for a 19-day history of high fever despite3-day treatment by azithromycin. His physical examination was unremarkable andcontrast-enhanced CT showed only a low attenuated area in the right lobe of theliver, indicating a cyst. WB-DWI revealed multiple nodular lesions ofhypo-diffusion in the liver, spine, and pelvic region. The biopsy specimens ofthe liver abscess showed no evidence of tuberculosis/malignancy and thepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of liver abscess aspirate showed positivefindings for B. henselae, confirming the diagnosis of CSD. He completedminocycline monotherapy for a total of 60 days without any deterioration.CONCLUSIONS: WB-DWI can be useful for the diagnosis of atypical CSD with hepatic and bone involvement, which can cause FUO in young immunocompetent adults.

AB  - Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a prevalent infection of the genitourinarytract affecting millions of women worldwide. In the present study, the importanceof virulence factors, ERG11 gene mutations, ERG11 gene expression, and plasmamembrane ergosterol content for fluconazole resistance in Candida species wasinvestigated in 200 women suspected of vulvovaginitis. Isolated Candida specieswere identified using the ITS-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP)technique. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the CLSI document. ERG11 gene expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. ERG11 genemutation analysis was performed using sequencing methods, and the ergosterolcontent of the cell membrane was determined in fluconazole-resistant isolates.Furthermore, the production of phospholipase and proteinase enzymes was evaluatedin recurrent and non-recurrent infections. VVC was diagnosed in 101 (50.5%) ofthe 200 clinical cases, of which 21 (20.8%) were confirmed as RVVC. Candidaalbicans was the most prevalent species, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. guilliermondii. Ketoconazole and fluconazolewere the most effective drugs against C. albicans among five tested antifungalswith MIC ranges between 0.06 and 16mug/mL and 0.25-64mug/mL. Substitutions ofA114S, Y257H, T123I and A114V were detected in fluconazole-resistant C. albicans.The ergosterol content of the fungal cell membrane and the mean levels of ERG11gene expression transcript were higher in fluconazole-resistant C. albicansisolates obtained from RVVC than in those obtained from VVC cases. Phospholipase and proteinase were produced in different amounts in all Candida species isolatedfrom VVC and RVVC cases. In this review, our results demonstrated that severalmolecular mechanisms, including ERG11 gene expression, changes in the cellmembrane ergosterol content, and mutations in ERG11 gene alone or simultaneously involved in fluconazole resistance of C. albicans species and the recurrence ofVVC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the principal etiological agent of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) which has fatal outcome in children and elderly. Dueto poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation, conventional beta-lactamantibiotics fail to establish the requisite bactericidal concentration in centralnervous system leading to resistance in meningeal infections. The present studyintended to identify potential therapeutic alternatives against Streptococcalmeningitis. METHODS: Virtual screening, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)and anti-bacterial evaluations were employed to screen potential drugs. Moleculardocking and structural dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the bindingaffinity and interaction stability of the drugs against the conventionalPenicillin binding protein (PBP) targets. Screened drugs were also checked forinteractions with other possible Streptococcal targets and relevant host targets.RESULTS: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ketorolac and etodolacexhibiting high BBB-permeation and anti-bacterial potency were identified.Ketorolac and etodolac possessed uniform binding affinities against PBP1A, PBP2X,PBP2B and PBP3 with low inhibition constants (<50muM). Against PBP2B and PBP3,higher binding affinities were observed for ketorolac (-6.45 and -6Kcal/molrespectively) and etodolac (-6.36 and -6.55Kcal/mol respectively) than penicillin(-5.95 and -5.85Kcal/mol respectively) and cefotaxime (-5.08 and -5.07Kcal/molrespectively). The binding affinities were contributed by conventional H-bondsand non-canonical interactions with active site residues of PBPs. Structuraldynamics simulations further indicated the overall stability of the drug-boundcomplexes through minimal overall average root-mean square fluctuations (RMSFs)(<1.0A). The average binding affinities of Ketorolac and Etodolac with PBPs were marginally higher than other Streptococcal targets and comparable to theirconventional inflammatory targets. CONCLUSION: Pharmacological and structuralprofiles indicated that ketorolac and etodolac can potentially subdue the causeand effects of streptococcal meningitis and hence encourage experimentalvalidations.

AB  - Irrational use of antibiotics produces a large number of antibiotic-resistantbacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Wastewater treatmentplants (WWTPs) act as important sources and sinks of ARGs, and play an important role in their generation, treatment, and dissemination. This study summarized thetypes, concentrations, and factors of ARGs in WWTPs, investigated the sources of ARGs in wastewater, compared the removal efficiencies of different treatmentprocesses on ARGs, and analyzed the potential risk of ARGs accumulation ineffluent, sludge and their emission into the air. The results showed that themain ARGs detected in the influent of WWTPs were the genes resistant tomacrolides (ermB, ermF), tetracyclines (tetW, tetA, tetC), sulfonamides (sul1,sul2) and beta-lactams (blaOXA, blaTEM). The concentrations of ARGs in theinfluent of the WWTPs were 2.23x10(2)-3.90x10(9) copies/mL. Wastewater qualityand microbial community were the dominant factors that affected the distribution characteristics of ARGs. The accumulation of ARGs in effluent, sludge, andaerosols posed potential risks to the regional ecological environment and humanhealth. Based on these results, research trends with respect to ARGs in WWTPswere also prospected.

AB  - The rebound of black-odorous occurred in organic-rich sediments has become acritical issue due to its great harm to the ecological environment. Elements suchas S, C, and N play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of black-odorousrivers. As electronic acceptors, Ca(NO3)2 and CaO2 can effectively removeacidified volatile sulfide (AVS) and organic matter to control the black-odorous rebound. However, the remediation mechanisms in organic-rich sediments byCa(NO3)2 and CaO2 are unclear. The present study explored the mechanism of C-N-S interconnection degradation in organic-rich urban river sediments by addingdifferent ratios and sequences of Ca(NO3)2 and CaO2. The results showed thatCa(NO3)2 remediation followed by CaO2 and the accepted electron ratio 1:1 ofCa(NO3)2 to CaO2 is an effective method for controlling the rebound ofblack-odorous and reducing the accumulation NO2(-)-N. Mainly attributed to that, CaO2 enhanced the degradation of organic matter by stimulating enzymaticactivities in the sediments, which is also the main reason for controlling therebound of black-odorous. Since CaO2 releases O2 and *OH, which inhibitnosZgenes, NO2(-)-N accumulates when remedied simultaneously with Ca(NO3)2 andCaO2. Co-occurrence network analysis illustrated that sulfur-driven autotrophicdenitrification bacteria, heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria, andsulfate-reducing bacteria interact strongly inside one module, clarifying a solidinteraction of C-N-S substances among these bacteria. Our results reveal theC-N-S interconnection degradation mechanism and provide a new perspective onapplying biochemical remediation in organic-rich urban river sediments.

AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), commonly used drugs for treatment oftype 2 diabetes, increase the risk for bullous pemphigoid (BP). Currently themechanism leading to the loss of immunological tolerance of the cutaneousadhesion molecule BP180 as well as similarities and differences in diseaseprogression between DPP4i-associated BP (DPP4i-BP) and DPP4i independent"regular" BP (rBP) are largely unknown. We analyzed the expression of 32cytokines and two proteases by Luminex and ELISA assays in samples taken fromlesional and non-lesional skin of patients with rBP or DPP4i-BP, and healthycontrols. Cytokines mediating B-cell survival and targeting such as B-cellactivating factor (BAFF), CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 4, CXC chemokine ligand(CXCL) 12 and interleukin (IL) -6 were expressed at a higher level in thelesional rBP skin compared to that of DPP4i-BP. The DPP4i-BP samples hadincreased levels of eosinophilic cytokines CCL1, CCL17, CCL26 and IL-5, whichcorrelated with the serum level of anti-BP180 NC16A IgG autoantibodies. The mRNA expression of BAFF, IL-6, CCL1, CCL17, CCL26 and IL-5 measured by quantitativepolymerase chain reaction correlated with the protein levels. Taken together, thecutaneous cytokine profiles were found to provide distinctive molecularfingerprints between rBP and DPP4i-BP.

AB  - Secretion systems often utilize ATPase activity to facilitate the translocationof proteins into and across membranes. In bacteria, the universally conservedSecA ATPase binds a large repertoire of preproteins and interacts with the SecYEGtranslocon. In contrast, the type 7b secretion system (T7bSS) of Staphylococcusaureus supports the secretion of a restricted subset of proteins. T7bSSs arefound in several Firmicutes as gene clusters encoding for at least one secretedWXG100 protein and one protein with FtsK/SpoIIIE-like ATPase domains. In S.aureus, this ATPase is called EssC and comprises two cytosolicforkhead-associated domains (FHA1-2), two membrane-spanning segments (TM1-2), andfour cytosolic modules named DUF and ATPases 1 through 3 (D1D2D3). However, adetailed understanding of the interactions of EssC in the T7bSS is not clear.Here, we tagged EssC and performed affinity chromatography ofdetergent-solubilized extracts of wild type and isogenic mutants of S. aureus. Wefound that EssC recruits EsaA, EssA, and EssB in a complex referred to as the ESStranslocon, and secreted substrates were not required for translocon assembly.Furthermore, deletions of FHA1 and DUF rendered EssC unstable, while FHA2 wasrequired for association with EssB. This interaction was independent of EsaA, butEsaA was required to recruit EssA to the EssC-EssB complex. Finally, we showassembly of the ESS translocon was impaired upon mutation of D2 structuralmotifs. Together, our data indicate that the ESS translocon is maintained fullyassembled at the plasma membrane and that D2 is fundamental in sustaining theintegrity of this complex.

AB  - The molecular interactions that regulate chronic inflammation underlyingmetabolic disease remain largely unknown. Since the CD24-Siglec interactionregulates inflammatory response to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), we have generated multiple mouse strains with single or combined mutations ofCd24 or Siglec genes to explore the role of the CD24-Siglec interaction inmetaflammation and metabolic disorder. Here, we report that the CD24-Siglec-Eaxis, but not other Siglecs, is a key suppressor of obesity-related metabolicdysfunction. Inactivation of the CD24-Siglec-E pathway exacerbates, while CD24Fc treatment alleviates, diet-induced metabolic disorders, including obesity,dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Mechanistically, sialylation-dependent recognition of CD24 by Siglec-E inducesSHP-1 recruitment and represses metaflammation to protect against metabolicsyndrome. A first-in-human study of CD24Fc (NCT02650895) supports thesignificance of this pathway in human lipid metabolism and inflammation. Thesefindings identify the CD24-Siglec-E axis as an innate immune checkpoint againstmetaflammation and metabolic disorder and suggest a promising therapeutic target for metabolic disease.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin Levels Reflect Severity of Clinicopathological Findings in EarlyStage IgA Nephropathy.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1159/000525836 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Uromodulin (UMOD), also known as Tamm-Horsfall protein, is akidney-specific protein. Recently, low levels of urinary UMOD (uUMOD) have beenreported as a risk factor for renal function decline in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).However, the clinical significance of serum UMOD (sUMOD) is not clear. In thisstudy, we clarified the clinical significance of sUMOD in IgAN. METHODS: Onehundred eight biopsy-proven IgAN patients were included in this study. Therelationships between sUMOD levels and various clinicopathological findings were evaluated. RESULTS: sUMOD was positively correlated with estimated glomerularfiltration rate (eGFR) (p < 0.001, r = 0.5) and negatively correlated withcreatinine (Cr) (p < 0.0001, r = -0.51) and urinary protein (UP) (p = 0.005, r = -0.33). In the low sUMOD group (<145 ng/mL), Cr was significantly higher (p <0.0001) and histopathological changes were severe. The cumulative incidence of a 30% decline in eGFR was 25.6% overall, 0% in histological grade (H-G) I, 33.3% inH-G II, 59.6% in H-G III, and 66.7% in H-G IV. In univariate analyses, prognosticfactors for a 30% decline in eGFR were male, high UP, low albumin, low eGFR, and low sUMOD. When comparing the severe histopathological classes (H-G II-IV) andH-G I, low sUMOD was a risk factor for severe histopathological changes.Furthermore, in patients with eGFR > 60 (n = 74), multivariate analyses revealed that low sUMOD independently predicted a 30% decline in eGFR and having severehistopathological changes. CONCLUSION: In IgAN, sUMOD levels were associated withrenal function. Low sUMOD levels may be a risk factor for worsening renalfunction, especially in the early stage of IgAN.

AB  - The development of new antimicrobial agents is necessary to overcome the emergingantimicrobial resistance among infectious microbial pathogens. Herein, wesuccessfully designed and synthesized quinolinequinones (QQs) withN-phenylpiperazine (QQ1-7) containing strong or weak EDG in the amino moiety byconverting hydroxyquinoline (HQ) to the dichloroquinolinequinone (QQ) viachlorooxidation. We performed an extensive antimicrobial activity assessment ofthe QQs with N-phenylpiperazine (QQ1-7). Among the seven quinolinequinones (QQs) with N-phenylpiperazine tested, QQ3 and QQ4 were the most active moleculesagainst Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC(R) 29213) with a MIC value of 1.22 mug/mL. Inaddition to this, while QQ4 was more than six (6) times more effective towardsEnterococcus faecalis (ATCC(R) 29212), QQ3 was twenty-six (26) times moreeffective against same strain. Furthermore, the evaluation of antimicrobialactivity indicated that six of seven synthesized QQs (QQ1-4, QQ6, and QQ7)exhibited superior biological potency, eight (8) times for five of them (QQ1-4and QQ6) and two (2) times for QQ7, against Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC(R)12228). Besides, all QQs except QQ5 displayed excellent antifungal activityagainst the fungi Candida albicans (ATCC(R) 10231). Among these, the two QQs (QQ3and QQ4), which showed the lowest values against gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC(R) 29213), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC(R)12228), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC(R) 29212)) as well as fungal strains(Candida albicans (ATCC(R) 10231) and Candida parapsilosis (ATCC(R) 22019)), werefurther evaluated for their biofilm inhibition properties and their mode ofaction with in vitro potential antimicrobial activity against each of 20clinically obtained resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria, and bactericidalactivity using time-kill curve assay. In this study, we investigated thebactericidal effects of QQ3 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and Candida albicans strains. The findings of this study suggest that asignificant bactericidal effect was seen with all tested 1 x MIC and 4 x MICconcentrations used within 24 h. Our findings present significant implicationsfor an antimicrobial drug candidate for treating infections, especially thosecaused by clinically resistant MRSA isolates.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate effects of niacin on the intestinal epithelialbarrier, intestinal immunity, and microbial community in weaned pigletschallenged by Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). In this study, fifteen weanedpiglets were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, (1) control group, normal diet; (2) PDCoV group, infected with 1 x 10(7) TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-HN-17 strain by oral administration; (3) NA + PDCoV group, infected with 1 x 10(7) TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-HN-17 strain by oral administration following administration of 40 mgof niacin for three days. The results showed that PDCoV infection induceddiarrhea and other clinical symptoms with intestinal villi shedding and atrophyin weaned piglets. Niacin alleviated the symptoms of diarrhea and intestinaldamage of PDCoV-infected weaned piglets. Additionally, PDCoV increased (P < 0.05)the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins [zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) andClaudin] and antimicrobial peptides [porcine beta defensin 1 (pBD1), pBD2,proline-arginine rich 39-amino acid peptide (PR39) and protegrin 1-5 (PG1-5) inthe jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets, while niacin increased (P < 0.05) theexpression of PG1-5 compared with PDCoV. PDCoV increased (P < 0.05) the contents of serum interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8 and intestinal IL-8, and up-regulatedthe mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6,IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18 in ileum of weaned piglets compared with control.However, niacin decreased (P < 0.05) the contents of serum IL-1beta, IL-6 andintestinal IL-10 and IL-8, and also reduced (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression ofileal TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IL-12 in the PDCoV-infected piglets. Compared withcontrol, PDCoV up-regulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of key genes relatedto innate immune and antiviral molecules [toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), NOD1,NOD2, DDX58, CCL2, STAT2, Mx1, IFN-gamma, and protein kinase R (PKR) in the ileumof weaned piglets. Niacin decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of NOD1, NOD2,STAT2, IFN-gamma, and PKR in PDCoV-infected weaned piglets. Moreover, the mRNAexpression of IL-6 decreased (P < 0.05) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase(OAS), IFN-alpha, and PKR increased (P < 0.05) in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cellstreated with niacin in vitro. Furthermore, niacin decreased (P < 0.05) theelevation of protein expression including inducible NOS (iNOS), nuclearfactor-kappaB (NF-kappaB p65), inhibitor kappa B (IKKbeta), histone deacetylase[Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) and phosphorylation ofhistone H3 at serine s10 (pH3s10) in the ileum of PDCoV-infected piglets, andincreased (P < 0.05) the expression of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR109A).PDCoV disrupted the composition and structure of microflora in the colon ofweaned piglets, and reduced the relative abundance of the beneficial bacteriaSpirobacterium, but niacin could improve the intestinal microbial flora of thePDCoV-infected piglets associated with increasing the relative abundance ofLactobacillus. Overall, niacin could alleviate diarrhea, intestinal barrierdamages, intestinal immune response and colonic microflora disfunction inPDCoV-infected weaned piglets.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been applied to analyze bacterial cells and their responses to antibiotic exposure. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the origins of specific antibiotic response patterns andthe necessary experimental steps required to see them clearly in the SERSspectra, particularly involving SERS responses observed in the extracellularmatrix liquid of bacterial samples. In this study, a variety of experimentalparameters were tested to assess the antibiotic response patterns seen in liquid samples from E. coli under different conditions. These include testing the impactof washing the cells with water after incubating them with antibiotics, as wellas the effect of using different types of liquids with varying characteristicsfor incubating the bacteria with the antibiotics. It was found that theexperimental procedure has a significant impact on the resulting SERS signals,and the target patterns could only be observed in specific conditions. Inparticular, the step of washing the bacteria with water is necessary forobserving the antibiotic response patterns, and incubating the bacteria andantibiotics in a nutrient-rich growth medium is preferable to incubating thecells in a buffer or in distilled water. These findings can be used to improveexisting methods for testing antibiotic responses with SERS, and couldpotentially help to further develop and optimize SERS-based procedures forassessing antibiotic sensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, internal European borders weretemporarily re-established to mitigate the outbreak. Much research on pandemicborder control measures has focused on quantifying their effectiveness forinfectious disease control as well as on their social consequences forcross-border life in the European Union. However, little attention has been paid to the impacts for the practice and organisation of cross-border public health.To address this gap, the present study analysed the experiences and perspectives of public health professionals working in European border regions regardingborder control measures in the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitativeinterview-based study. METHODS: In total, 27 semistructured interviews withpublic health professionals were conducted in the border regions between Germany,the Netherlands and Belgium. Participants were asked about their perspectives on border control and the spread of COVID-19 in the region. Interviews wereperformed between December 2020 and April 2021 and carried out in German,English, Dutch and French. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, borders hadbecome largely invisible with extensive cross-border social life and mobility.Participants were sceptical about the role of cross-border mobility as a pandemicdriver and consequently the effectiveness of enforcing border control forreducing the spread of COVID-19 in their border regions. At the same time,participants raised concerns about the negative consequences for the socialfabric and provision of cross-border public health. CONCLUSIONS: Public healthprofessionals highlighted the uncertain role of border control measures forregional infectious disease control in border regions. Rather than bordercontrol, sustainable cross-border communication and collaboration is crucial toensure effective pandemic management in border regions.

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) containing positional isomers of hypogeic (Hy),palmitoleic (Po), and palmitvaccenic (Pv) acids from three microorganisms(top-fermenting brewer's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, green alga Coccomyxaelongata, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis) wereanalyzed. Dozens of regioisomers and enantiomers of TAGs containing one, two orthree hexadecenoic acids have been identified by means of reversed phasechromatography/mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC/MS). The regioisomers of TAGscontaining two palmitic acids and any hexadecenoic acid were separated. Analysis of regioisomers of TAGs having one Pv residue showed that asymmetric molecularspecies such as PvPP or PPPv were dominant in Rhizophagus. TAGs were alsoanalyzed on a chiral phase column and nine molecular species of TAGs containingtwo palmitic and any of three hexadecenoic acids were separated and identified.In the case of TAGs containing one palmitic and two hexadecenoic acids, theseparation was successful only if the hexadecenoic acids were identical.Separation of TAGs containing three hexadecenoic acids was successful only if allthree hexadecenoic acids were identical. Regardless of the type of TAG, it wasfound that TAGs in the AM fungus and containing palmitvaccenic acid bound at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone were dominant, suggesting similarity inthe biosynthesis of the different TAGs. The covalent adduct chemical ionizationmethod was used for identification of TAGs as adduct with(1-methyleneimino)-1-ethenyl ion, which reacted with double bond of theunsaturated fatty acid. Tandem MS thus makes it possible to identify TAGscontaining various hexadecenoic acids.

TI  - Viability study of clinical bacterial strains by capillary electrophoresis andflow cytometry approaches.
LID - 10.1002/elps.202200096 [doi]
AB  - One of the challenges medicine faces is the constantly growing resistance ofpathogens to various classes of antibiotics. In this study, we investigated theuse of capillary electrophoresis (CE) to characterize and assess thephysiological states of three clinical bacterial strains - Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA), and Escherichiacoli ESbetaL - exposed to different antibiotics. All chosen bacteria are theleading causes of healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired invasive infectionsin adults. In the first part of the research, it was determined the optimalincubation time of the tested strains with antibiotics, represented as an optimaltime 24 hours. In the second part, we have compared two approaches: flowcytometry (FC) as a standard method and CE as a proposed alternative approach.The viability of clinical strains treated with different class antibioticscalculated in CE measurements, was strongly correlated (>0.83 for MSSA, >0.92 forESbetaL and MRSA) with the viability obtained on the basis of FC measurements. Asa result, CE has a chance to become a modern diagnostic method used in clinicalpractice. The CE cut-off was found to be 50%; above this value, the strain shows resistance to the action of the antibiotic. This article is protected bycopyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Get2PrEP: An EMR Lab Comment Increased Safe Sex Counseling but not PrEP Services at a Large Urban Academic Medical Center in Northern Manhattan.
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) remains underutilized despite its efficacy and potential population impact. Achieving PrEP's full potential dependsupon providers who are knowledgeable and comfortable prescribing it toindividuals at risk of acquiring HIV. Previous educational interventionstargeting provider-related uptake barriers have had limited success. We designed and tested an electronic medical record (EMR) interpretative comment to improvethe delivery of PrEP. METHODS: An EMR comment provided information on PrEPeligibility and referral resources to providers delivering positive chlamydia andgonorrhea results. Positive tests for bacterial sexually transmitted infectionspre-intervention (01/01/19 - 08/23/19) and post-intervention (08/24/19 -12/31/19) were identified. A retrospective chart review was conducted toascertain provider documentation of PrEP discussions or provision, HIV preventiondiscussions, and HIV screening. Pretest-posttest analysis was performed tocompare the provision of PrEP and HIV prevention services. RESULTS: We reviewed856 pre-intervention encounters spanning eight months and 461 post-encountersspanning four months. Patient demographics were comparable. We observed anincrease in provider documentation of safe sex and condom counseling(respectively, OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.07-1.18: OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17), and theabsence of any HIV prevention discussion decreased (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90),but not HIV screening or PrEP documentation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that anEMR lab comment had a modest effect on increasing risk reduction counseling,though not HIV screening or PrEP prescriptions. Future strategies to encourageprovider delivery of sexual health services may benefit from more targetedstrategies that combine behavioral and IT approaches.

TI  - Advancing Sexual Harassment Prevention and Elimination in the Sciences: "Everysexual health organization must do something similar."
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001683 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sexual harassment is pervasive in science. A 2018 report found thatthe prevalence of sexual harassment in academia in the U.S. is 58%. An activityheld at an international scientific congress was designed to advance sexualharassment prevention and elimination and empower binary and non-binary personsat risk for harassment, discrimination, and violence. The objective is todescribe the activity and outcomes to provide a promising model for otherscientific communities. METHODS: A description of the plenary and key components as well as the data collection and analysis of selected outcomes are provided.RESULTS: Among 1,338 congress participants from 61 countries, 526 (39%) attended the #MeToo plenary and the majority engaged in some way during the plenarysession. Engagement included standing for the pledge (~85%), participating in thequestion and answer session (n = 5), seeking counseling (n = 3), and/or providingwritten post-it comments (n = 96). Respondents to a post-congress survey (N =388, 24% of all attendees) ranked the plenary as number one among 14congressional plenaries. In post-analysis, the written post-it comments weresorted into 14 themes within 6 domains including: (1) emotional responses, (2)barriers to speaking out, (3) public health priorities, (4) reframing narratives about the issue, (5) allyship, and (6) moving the issue forward. CONCLUSIONS:Scientific organizations, agencies, and institutions have an important role toplay in setting norms and changing enabling policies towards a zero-toleranceculture of sexual harassment. The activity presented offers a promising model forscientific communities with similar goals. The outcomes suggest that the plenary successfully engaged participants and had a measurable impact on theparticipants.

AB  - Shortly after the implementation of community mitigation measures in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), sharp declines inrespiratory syncytial virus and influenza circulation were noted; post-mitigationcirculation of other respiratory pathogens has gone unexplored. Weretrospectively analyzed all records of a provider-ordered multiplex test betweenApril 1, 2018, and July 31, 2021, in Nashville, Tennessee, and we noted disruptedhistorical seasonal patterns for common respiratory pathogens during theSARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

TI  - Engineering Critical Amino Acid Residues of Lanosterol Synthase to Improve theProduction of Triterpenoids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00098 [doi]
AB  - Triterpenoids are a subgroup of terpenoids and have wide applications in thefood, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. The heterologous production ofvarious triterpenoids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as other microbes, hasbeen successfully implemented as these production hosts not only produce theprecursor of triterpenoids 2,3-oxidosqualene by the mevalonate pathway but alsoallow simple expression of plant membrane-anchored enzymes. Nevertheless,2,3-oxidosqualene is natively converted to lanosterol catalyzed by the endogenouslanosterol synthase (Erg7p), causing low production of recombinant triterpenoids.While simple deletion of ERG7 was not effective, in this study, the criticalamino acid residues of Erg7p were engineered to lower this critical enzymeactivity. The engineered S. cerevisiae indeed accumulated 2,3-oxidosqualene up to180 mg/L. Engineering triterpenoid synthesis into the ERG7-modified strainresulted in 7.3- and 3-fold increases in the titers of dammarane-type andlupane-type triterpenoids, respectively. This study presents an efficientinducer-free strategy for lowering Erg7p activity, thereby providing2,3-oxidosqualene for the enhanced production of various triterpenoids.

AB  - The aim of this randomized, controlled trial is to determine whetheranti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin protects against severe COVID-19 in severelyimmunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients. Patients were randomlyassigned to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (COVIG) or intravenousimmunoglobulin without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Severe COVID-19 was observed in twoout of ten (20%) patients treated with COVIG compared to seven out of eight (88%)in the IVIG control group (p = 0.015, Fisher's exact test). COVIG may be avaluable treatment in severely immunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patientsand should be considered when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available. Thetrial was registered at www.trialregister.nl (#NL9436).

AB  - We evaluated the performance of nasal and nasopharyngeal Standard Q COVID-19 Agtests (SD Biosensor) and the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (nasal, Abbott)against the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay during the Omicron (21 M, 21K and21L) wave in South Africa. Overall, all evaluated tests performed well with high level of sensitivity (ranging from 77.78-81.42%) and excellent specificity values(>99%). The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests increased above 90% in sampleswith Ct <20, and all three tests performed best within first week of symptomonset. The Panbio Ag test performed best in the context of Omicron 21Linfections, that were also characterised by significantly lower Ct valuescompared to infections with 21K and 21 M.

AB  - Several monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (mAbs) have received emergencyauthorization for COVID-19 treatment. However, most of these mAbs are not active against the highly mutated Omicron SARS-CoV-2 subvariants. We have tested apolyclonal approach of equine anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab')2 antibodies that achieved a high level of neutralizing potency against all SARS-CoV-2 VoCs tested includingOmicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12 and BA.4/5. A repertoire of antibodies targetingconserved epitopes in different regions of the spike protein could plausiblyaccount for this remarkable breadth of neutralization. These results warrant the clinical investigation of equine polyclonal F(ab')2 antibodies as a noveltherapeutic strategy against COVID-19.

LID - 10.1080/19490976.2022.2106105 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic bacterial strain Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been shown toalleviate symptoms of intestinal inflammation in human clinical trials and animalfeed supplementation studies. To identify factors involved in immunomodulatoryeffects on host cells, E. faecium SF68 and other commensal and clinicalEnterococcus isolates were screened using intestinal epithelial cell linesharboring reporter fusions for NF-kappaB and JNK(AP-1) activation to determinethe responses of host cell innate immune signaling pathways when challenged with bacterial protein and cell components. Cell-free, whole-cell lysates of E.faecium SF68 showed a reversible, inhibitory effect on both NF-kappaB andJNK(AP-1) signaling pathway activation in intestinal epithelial cells andabrogated the response to bacterial and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.The inhibitory effect was species-specific, and was not observed for E. avium, E.gallinarum, or E. casseliflavus. Screening of protein fractions of E. faeciumSF68 lysates yielded an active fraction containing a prominent protein identifiedas arginine deiminase (ADI). The E. faecium SF68 arcA gene encoding argininedeiminase was cloned and introduced into E. avium where it conferred the sameNF-kappaB inhibitory effects on intestinal epithelial cells as seen for E.faecium SF68. Our results indicate that the arginine deiminase of E. faecium SF68is responsible for inhibition of host cell NF-kappaB and JNK(AP-1) pathwayactivation, and is likely to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory andimmunomodulatory effects observed in prior clinical human and animal trials. The implications for the use of this probiotic strain for preventive and therapeutic purposes are discussed.

AB  - Fruits of Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck var. Valencia contain hesperidin as a majorflavanone glycoside. Hesperidin (H) was isolated from the peels of Valenciaorange and formulated as hexosomal nanodispersions (F1) adopting the hotemulsification method. The antimycobacterial activity(anti-TB) was evaluatedthrough a microplate Alamar blue (MABA) assay where F1 showed significantactivity with MIC = 0.19 microM. To unravel the potential mechanism of theanti-TB, a molecular docking study of H using the Mycobacterial Dihydrofolatereductase (Mtb. DHFR) enzyme was performed. Hesperidin exhibited significantinteractions with Mtb. DHFR active site. Sulforhodamine B assay was applied toevaluate cytotoxic activity against the lung cancer cell line (A-549). F1 showed a cytotoxic effect at IC50= 33 microM. It also has potent antiviral activityagainst Human Coronavirus 229E with IC50= 258.8 muM utilising crystal violetassay. Peels of Valencia orange could be a source of bioactive metabolites tocontrol significant diseases.

TI  - The Antibacterial Action of Safranin and Gentian Violet.
LID - 10.5041/RMMJ.10475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing resistance of many bacterial pathogens againstantibiotic measures urgently requires new or repurposing therapeutic strategies. Gentian violet is a triarylmethane dye used as a histological stain and forGram's method of classifying bacteria. It also exerts an antimicrobial effectagainst certain pathogens, especially dermatological infections. Safranin is the most popular counterstain used in medical laboratories due to its low cost andsafe laboratory usage. However, few studies have been conducted on theantimicrobial activity of safranin. OBJECTIVE: With the growing prevalence ofmultidrug-resistant bacteria, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterialefficacy of gentian violet and safranin against multidrug-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).METHODS: All tested bacteria were multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria isolatedfrom skin infections (abscesses and wounds). Using gentian violet and safranin,antibacterial effects were studied using the well-diffusion method against 20samples of clinically isolated bacteria, 10 diagnosed as S. aureus, and 10 as P. aeruginosa. Bacteria were diagnosed using the VITEK 2 automated system(bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). Iodine served as the control agent, sinceboth Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are sensitive to it. RESULTS:Gentian violet dye has been shown to be 100% sensitive to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates. Although safranin also had high sensitivity(100%) to S. aureus isolates, its sensitivity to P. aeruginosa was only 20%.Staphylococcus aureus was more resistant to iodine (40% sensitivity) compared to P. aeruginosa, which was 100% sensitive to iodine. CONCLUSIONS: Gentian violetand safranin are low-cost and better tolerated topical agents that have potentialfor use in dermatological applications. Gentian violet had good antibacterialactivity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, making it useful for treating bacterial skin pathogens such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosaespecially for MDR bacteria. While safranin has good efficacy againstGram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), its effect against Gram-negative bacteria(e.g. P. aeruginosa) is poor.

TI  - Polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines to Streptococcus pneumoniae generatedistinct humoral responses.
PG  - eabm4065
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abm4065 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia,bacteremia, and meningitis in older adults worldwide. Two pneumococcal vaccinescontaining S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides are in current use: thepolysaccharide vaccine PPSV23 and the glycoconjugate vaccine PCV13. In clinicaltrials, both vaccines elicit similar opsonophagocytic killing activity. Incontrast to polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines have shown consistentefficacy against nasopharyngeal carriage and noninvasive pneumonia overall andfor some prevalent individual serotypes. Given these different clinical profiles,it is crucial to understand the differential immunological responses induced bythese two vaccines. Here, we used a high-throughput systems serology approach to profile the biophysical and functional features of serum antibodies induced byPCV13 and PPSV23 at 1 month and 1 year. In comparison with PPSV23, PCV13 induced higher titers across antibody isotypes; more durable antibody responses acrossimmunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM isotypes; and increased antigenic breadth.Although titers measured in opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assays were similarbetween the two groups, confirming what was observed in clinical studies, serumsamples from PCV13 vaccinees could induce additional non-OPA antibody-dependentfunctions, including monocyte phagocytosis and natural killer cell activation. Ina multivariate modeling approach, distinct humoral profiles were demonstrated in each arm. Together, these results demonstrate that the glycoconjugate PCV13vaccine induces an antigenically broader, more durable, polyfunctional antibodyresponse. These findings may help explain the increased protection against S.pneumoniae colonization and noninvasive pneumonia and the longer duration ofprotection against invasive pneumococcal disease, mediated by PCV13.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms promoting chromosomal translocations of therearranging receptor loci in leukemia and lymphoma remains incomplete. Here weshow that leukemias induced by aberrant activation of beta-catenin in thymocytes,which bear recurrent Tcra/Myc-Pvt1 translocations, depend on Tcf-1. The DNAdouble strand breaks (DSBs) in the Tcra site of the translocation areRag-generated, whereas the Myc-Pvt1 DSBs are not. Aberrantly activatedbeta-catenin redirects Tcf-1 binding to novel DNA sites to alter chromatinaccessibility and down-regulate genome-stability pathways. Impaired homologousrecombination (HR) DNA repair and replication checkpoints lead to retention ofDSBs that promote translocations and transformation of double-positive (DP)thymocytes. The resulting lymphomas, which resemble human T cell acutelymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), are sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). Ourfindings indicate that aberrant beta-catenin signaling contributes totranslocations in thymocytes by guiding Tcf-1 to promote the generation andretention of replication-induced DSBs allowing their coexistence withRag-generated DSBs. Thus, PARPis could offer therapeutic options in hematologicmalignancies with active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

TI  - Gammaherpesvirus-mediated repression reveals EWSR1 to be a negative regulator of B cell responses.
PG  - e2123362119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2123362119 [doi]
AB  - The germinal center (GC) plays a central role in the generation ofantigen-specific B cells and antibodies. Tight regulation of the GC is essential due to the inherent risks of tumorigenesis and autoimmunity posed byinappropriate GC B cell processes. Gammaherpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) utilize numerous armaments to drive infected naive B cells, independent of antigen, through GC reactions to expandthe latently infected B cell population and establish a stable latency reservoir.We previously demonstrated that the MHV68 microRNA (miRNA) mghv-miR-M1-7-5prepresses host EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) to promote B cellinfection. EWSR1 is a transcription and splicing regulator that is recognized forits involvement as a fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma. A function for EWSR1 in Bcell responses has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that 1) Bcell-specific deletion of EWSR1 had no effect on generation of mature B cellsubsets or basal immunoglobulin levels in naive mice, 2) repression or ablationof EWSR1 in B cells promoted expansion of MHV68 latently infected GC B cells, and3) B cell-specific deletion of EWSR1 during a normal immune response to nonviral antigen resulted in significantly elevated numbers of antigen-specific GC Bcells, plasma cells, and circulating antibodies. Notably, EWSR1 deficiency didnot affect the proliferation or survival of GC B cells but instead resulted inthe generation of increased numbers of precursor GC B cells. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that EWSR1 is a negative regulator of B cell responses.

TI  - Organohalide Respiration with Diclofenac by Dehalogenimonas.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c08824 [doi]
AB  - Diclofenac (DCF) is a pharmaceutically active contaminant frequently found inaquatic ecosystems. The transformation pathways and microbiology involved in the biodegradation of DCF, particularly under anoxic conditions, remain poorlyunderstood. Here, we demonstrated microbially mediated reductive dechlorinationof DCF in anaerobic enrichment culture derived from contaminated river sediment. Over 90% of the initial 76.7 +/- 3.6 muM DCF was dechlorinated at a maximum rate of 1.8 +/- 0.3 muM day(-1) during a 160 days' incubation. Mass spectrometricanalysis confirmed that 2-(2-((2-chlorophenyl)amino)phenyl)acetic acid (2-CPA)and 2-anilinophenylacetic acid (2-APA) were formed as the monochlorinated andnonchlorinated DCF transformation products, respectively. A survey of microbialcomposition and Sanger sequencing revealed the enrichment and dominance of a new Dehalogenimonas population, designated as Dehalogenimonas sp. strain DCF, in the DCF-dechlorinating community. Following the stoichiometric conversion of DCF to2-CPA (76.0 +/- 2.1 muM) and 2-APA (3.7 +/- 0.8 muM), strain DCF cell densitiesincreased by 24.4 +/- 4.4-fold with a growth yield of 9.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(8) cellsper mumol chloride released. Our findings expand the metabolic capability in the genus Dehalogenimonas and highlight the relevant roles of organohalide-respiring bacteria for the natural attenuation of halogenated contaminants of emergingconcerns (e.g., DCF).

AB  - Western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, LeConte, is aninsect pest that poses a significant threat to the productivity of modernagriculture, causing significant economic and crop losses. The development ofgenetically modified (GM) crops expressing one or more proteins that confertolerance to specific insect pests, such as WCR, was a historic breakthrough inagricultural biotechnology and continues to serve as an invaluable tool in pestmanagement. Despite this, evolving resistance to existing insect control proteinsexpressed in current generation GM crops requires continued identification of newproteins with distinct modes of action while retaining targeted insecticidalefficacy. GM crops expressing insecticidal proteins must undergo extensive safetyassessments prior to commercialization to ensure that they pose no increased riskto the health of humans or other animals relative to their non-GM conventionalcounterparts. As part of these safety evaluations, a weight of evidence approach is utilized to assess the safety of the expressed insecticidal proteins toevaluate any potential risk in the context of dietary exposure. This studydescribes the food and feed safety assessment of Vpb4Da2, a new Bacillusthuringiensis insecticidal protein that confers in planta tolerance to WCR.Vpb4Da2 exhibits structural and functional similarities to other insect controlproteins expressed in commercialized GM crops. In addition, the lack of homology to known toxins or allergens, a lack of acute toxicity in mice, inactivation byconditions commonly experienced in the human gut or during cooking/foodprocessing, and the extremely low expected dietary exposure to Vpb4Da2 provide a substantial weight of evidence to demonstrate that the Vpb4Da2 protein poses noindication of a risk to the health of humans or other animals.

AB  - In nature, plants interact with a wide range of microorganisms, and most of thesemicroorganisms could induce growth through the activation of important molecular pathways. The current study evaluated whether the endophytic bacterium Bacillusaryabhattai encourages plant growth and the transcriptional changes that might beimplicated in this effect. The endophytic bacterium promotes the growth ofArabidopsis and tobacco plants. The transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis plantstreated with the bacterium were also identified, and the results showed thatvarious genes, such as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, apyrase, thioredoxin H8,benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, indoleacetaldoxime dehydratase, berberine bridgeenzyme-like and gibberellin-regulated protein, were highly expressed. Also,endophytic bacterial genes, such as arginine decarboxylase, D-hydantoinase, ATPsynthase gamma chain and 2-hydroxyhexa-2,4-dienoate hydratase, were activatedduring the interaction. These findings demonstrate that the expression of novelplant growth-related genes is induced by interaction with the endophyticbacterium B. aryabhattai and that these changes may promote plant growth insustainable agriculture.

PG  - e0009964
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009964 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an endemic disease in Rwanda, but littleis known about its prevalence and causative mycobacterial species. The diseasecauses tremendous losses in livestock and wildlife and remains a significantthreat to public health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study employinga systematic random sampling of cattle (n = 300) with the collection ofretropharyngeal lymph nodes and tonsils (n = 300) irrespective of granulomatouslesions was carried out in six abattoirs to investigate the prevalence andidentify mycobacterial species using culture, acid-fast bacteria staining,polymerase chain reaction, and GeneXpert assay. Individual risk factors and theorigin of samples were analysed for association with the prevalence. FINDINGS: Ofthe 300 sample pools, six were collected with visible TB-like lesions. Ourfindings demonstrated the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)in 1.7% (5/300) of sampled slaughtered cattle. M. bovis was isolated from 1.3%(4/300) animals while one case was caused by a rifampicin-resistance (RR) M.tuberculosis. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were identified in 12.0% (36/300) ofthe sampled cattle. There were no significant associations between the prevalenceand abattoir category, age, sex, and breeds of slaughtered cattle. CONCLUSIONS:This study is the first in Rwanda to isolate both M. bovis and RR M. tuberculosisin slaughtered cattle indicating that bTB is present in Rwanda with a lowprevalence. The isolation of RR M. tuberculosis from cattle indicates possiblezooanthroponotic transmission of M. tuberculosis and close human-cattle contact. To protect humans against occupational zoonotic diseases, it is essential tocontrol bTB in cattle and raise the awareness among all occupational groups aswell as reinforce biosafety at the farm level and in the abattoirs.

AB  - Canonical aminoglycosides are a large group of antibiotics, where the part ofchemical diversity stems from the substitution of the neamine ring system onpositions 5 and 6. Certain aminoglycoside modifying enzymes can modify a broadrange of 4,5- and 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides, with some as many as 15.This study presents the structural and kinetic results describing a promiscuousaminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(3)-IIIa. This enzyme has been crystallizedin ternary complex with coenzyme A and 4,5- and 4,6-disubstitutedaminoglycosides. We have followed up this work with kinetic characterizationutilizing a panel of diverse aminoglycosides, including a next-generationaminoglycoside, plazomicin. Lastly, we observed an alternative binding mode ofgentamicin in the aminoglycoside binding site, which was proven to be acrystallographic artifact based on mutagenesis.

TI  - Modelling inflammatory biomarker dynamics in a human lipopolysaccharide (LPS)challenge study using delay differential equations.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15476 [doi]
AB  - Clinical studies in healthy volunteers challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a constituent of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, represent a key modelto characterize the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory response.Here, we developed a mathematical modelling framework to quantitativelycharacterize the dynamics and inter-individual variability of multipleinflammatory biomarkers in healthy volunteer LPS challenge studies. Data frompreviously reported LPS challenge studies were used, which includedindividual-level time course data for tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Aone-compartment model with first-order elimination was used to capture the LPSkinetics. The relationships between LPS and inflammatory markers wascharacterized using indirect response (IDR) models. Delay differential equations were applied to quantify the delays in biomarker response profiles. For LPSkinetics, our estimates of clearance and volume of distribution were 35.7 L h(-1)and 6.35 L, respectively. Our model adequately captured the dynamics of multiple inflammatory biomarkers. The time delay for the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 were estimated to be 0.924, 1.46 and 1.48 h, respectively. A second IDRmodel was used to describe the induced changes of CRP in relation to IL-6, with adelayed time of 4.2 h. The quantitative models developed in this study can beused to inform design of clinical LPS challenge studies and may help to translatepreclinical LPS challenge studies to humans.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the abundance and distribution ofpsychrophilic microorganisms associated with spoilage in beef slaughterhouseenvironments after cleaning. The processing lines and equipment used inslaughtering and boning were swabbed, and the microbial count was determinedusing a TSA and MRS medium and Chromocult(R) Coliform agar incubated at 15masculineC and 37 masculineC, respectively. As a result, the brisket saw (handle side) and trolley hook were the most heavily contaminated with microorganisms,with each having a microbial adhesion rate of 66.7%. The microbial adhesion ratesof the apron and milling cutter (edge side) were 50%, respectively, and those of the foot cutter (edge and handle side), splitting saw (edge side), and knife(handle side) were 33.3%, respectively. Next, four colonies were randomlyisolated from the petri dish used for the bacterial count measurement to identifythe predominant microbial species of the microorganisms attached to eachequipment. As a result of Sanger sequencing analysis, yeasts such as Candidazeylanoides and Rhodotorula sp. and bacteria including Pseudomonas sp. andRhodococcus sp. were identified from the equipment used in the slaughtering line,and it was assumed that these microorganisms were of environmental origin. Incontrast, only Pseudomonas sp. and Candida zeylanoides were isolated from theboning line. Despite the use of cleaning operations, this study identified someequipment was contaminated with microorganisms. Since this equipment frequentlycomes into direct contact with the carcass, it is critical to thoroughly removethe microorganisms through accurate cleaning to prevent the spread of microbialcontamination on the carcasses.

TI  - Implementation of a Novel Optogenetic Tool in Mammalian Cells Based on a Split T7RNA Polymerase.
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00067 [doi]
AB  - Optogenetic tools are widely used to control gene expression dynamics both inprokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These tools are used in a variety of biologicalapplications from stem cell differentiation to metabolic engineering. Despitesome tools already available in bacteria, no light-inducible system currentlyexists to control gene expression independently from mammalian transcriptionaland/or translational machineries thus working orthogonally to endogenousregulatory mechanisms. Such a tool would be particularly important in syntheticbiology, where orthogonality is advantageous to achieve robust activation ofsynthetic networks. Here we implement, characterize, and optimize a newoptogenetic tool in mammalian cells based on a previously published system inbacteria called Opto-T7RNAPs. The tool is orthogonal to the cellular machineryfor transcription and consists of a split T7 RNA polymerase coupled with the bluelight-inducible magnets system (mammalian OptoT7-mOptoT7). In our study weexploited the T7 polymerase's viral origins to tune our system's expressionlevel, reaching up to an almost 20-fold change activation over the dark control. mOptoT7 is used here to generate mRNA for protein expression, shRNA for proteininhibition, and Pepper aptamer for RNA visualization. Moreover, we show thatmOptoT7 can mitigate the gene expression burden when compared to anotheroptogenetic construct. These properties make mOptoT7 a powerful new tool to usewhen orthogonality and viral RNA species (that lack endogenous RNA modifications)are desired.

TI  - Enzyme-Catalyzed Spiroacetal Formation in Polyketide Antibiotic Biosynthesis.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c03313 [doi]
AB  - A key step in the biosynthesis of numerous polyketides is the stereospecificformation of a spiroacetal (spiroketal). We report here that spiroacetalformation in the biosynthesis of the macrocyclic polyketides ossamycin andoligomycin involves catalysis by a novel spiroacetal cyclase. OssO from theossamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is homologous to OlmO, the product ofan unannotated gene from the oligomycin BGC. The deletion of olmO abolishedoligomycin production and led to the isolation of oligomycin-like metaboliteslacking the spiroacetal structure. Purified OlmO catalyzed complete conversion ofthe major metabolite into oligomycin C. Crystal structures of OssO and OlmOreveal an unusual 10-strand beta-barrel. Three conserved polar residues areclustered together in the beta-barrel cavity, and site-specific mutation of anyof these residues either abolished or substantially diminished OlmO activity,supporting a role for general acid/general base catalysis in spiroacetalformation.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital healthcare workers in Western Switzerlandat the end of the second pandemic wave.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001558 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. In early January 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirusdisease 2019) rapidly spread from China and caused a worldwidepandemic.Hypothesis. Healthcare workers represent a high-risk group for acquiringCOVID-19 and for nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Aim. We aimed to investigate over a 1 year period, across twopandemic waves, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in employees at a WesternSwitzerland public hospital.Methodology. A prospective observational SARS-CoV-2seroprevalence study was proposed to all hospital employees who enrolled on avoluntary basis.Results. Out of 594 participants recruited on a voluntary basis, 269 volunteers (45.3 %) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: this seroprevalence wastwice higher than that reported in the local community. Healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly higher oddsratio (OR) of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology [OR 3.19, 95 % confidenceinterval (CI) 2.16-4.74]. Symptoms showing the highest association with apositive serology were anosmia (OR 11.9, 95 % CI 5.58-30.9) and ageusia (OR 10.3,95 % CI 4.8-26.3). A total of 17.1 % (95 % CI 12.2-21.1 %) of SARS-CoV-2seropositive volunteers did not report a suspicion of COVID-19 in their personal history.Conclusion. Overall, we observed that the impact of the second SARS-CoV-2pandemic wave was considerable and significantly affected healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Variations in oral microbiome and its predictive functions between tumorous andhealthy individuals.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001568 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. The oral cavity is one of the largest reservoirs of microorganisms and many pathogenic bacteria have been shown to be associated with the aetiology of oral cancers.Gap Statement. Owing to the complexity of oral microbialcommunities and their unclear relationship with oral cancer, identification ofspecific bacteria which contribute to oral cancer is a key imperative.Aim. Tocompare and investigate the variations in the composition of the bacterialmicrobiome and its functions between patients with oral tumorous lesions andhealthy subjects.Methodology. Twenty-seven samples from individuals with oraltumours (five oral benign tumours and 22 oral squamous cell carcinomas) and 15samples from healthy subjects were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted and theV3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Subsequently, bioinformaticassessment was conducted using QIIME2, PICRUSt and linear discriminant analysiseffect size analyses (LEfSe).Results. The oral microbiota was composed mainly of the phyla Proteobacteria (31.76 %, 35.00 %), Bacteroidetes (30.13 %, 25.13 %) andFirmicutes (23.92 %, 17.07 %) in tumorous and healthy individuals, respectively. Neisseria, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga, Veillonella,Haemophilus, Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Leptotrichia were the most abundantgenera. Alpha diversity in the tumour group was significantly greater than thatin the healthy group (P<0.05). Differential analysis of microbes between groupsdemonstrated a significantly higher number of Neisseria, Veillonella,Streptococcus, Leptotrichia, Lautropia, Sphingopyxis, Sphingobium, Tannerella,Actinomyces and Rothia in healthy controls compared with the tumour group.However, the genera Treponema, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium,Parvimos, Loktanella, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Catonella, Aggregatibacterand Propionibacterium were significantly higher in the tumour group. Pathwaysrelated to cancers, cell motility, environmental adaptation, metabolism andsignal transduction were enhanced in the tumour group, while functions associatedwith immune system diseases, replication, repair and translation weresignificantly enhanced in the healthy group.Conclusion. Variations in the oralmicrobiota and its functions showed a correlation with oral tumours. The tumourgroup showed an increased abundance of some multi-drug-resistant andperiodontitis-related pathogens. The significantly altered microbiotas may serve as potential biomarkers or inform combination therapy for oral tumours.

TI  - Space-Confined Synthesis of Thin Polypyrrole Nanosheets in Layered BismuthOxychloride for a Photoresponse Antibacterial within the Near-Infrared Window andAccelerated Wound Healing.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c11503 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infection greatly affects the rate of wound healing. Both photothermal and photodynamic antibacterial therapies activated by near-infrared (NIR) lightwith semiconductor nanomedicine are two effective approaches to address bacterialinfections, but they cannot coexist synergistically to kill bacteria moreefficiently because of the limitation of the band structure. Here, inspired bythe natural core-shell structure and photosynthesis simultaneously, polypyrrole(PPy) is synthesized in the two-dimensional restricted area of the layeredbismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) nanosheets through the in situ ultrasonicrecombination method. The atomic-level interface contact and bonding formed inthe PPy-BiOCl intercalated nanosheets not only improve the light-to-heatconversion capabilities of PPy but also promote the transmission of PPyphotogenerated charge carriers to the BiOCl semiconductor. The nanocompositestake advantage of the deeper tissue penetration under NIR light irradiation andexhibit excellent photothermal and photodynamic synergistic antibacterialactivity. In addition, PPy-BiOCl intercalated nanosheets have goodbiocompatibility and accelerate wound healing through their antimicrobialactivity and skin repair function. The space-confined synthesis of thin PPynanosheets in layered structures offers an efficient NIR photoresponsivenanomedicine for the treatment of pathogen infection, with promising applicationsin infected wound healing.

TI  - Enhanced mitochondrial activity reshapes a gut microbiota profile that delaysNASH progression.
LID - 10.1002/hep.32705 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction promotesprogression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by aggravating the gut-liver status. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, wehypothesized that enhanced mitochondrial activity might reshape a specificmicrobiota signature that, when transferred to germ-free (GF) mice, could delayNASH progression. Design WT and methylation-controlled J protein knock-out(MCJ-KO) mice were fed for 6 weeks with either control or a choline-deficient,L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDA-HFD). One mouse of each group acted as adonor of caecal microbiota to GF mice, who also underwent the CDA-HFD model for 3weeks. Hepatic injury, intestinal barrier, gut microbiome and the associatedfaecal metabolome were then studied. RESULTS: Following 6 weeks of CDA-HFD, theabsence of MCJ, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I activity, reduced hepaticinjury and improved gut-liver axis in an aggressive NASH dietary model. Thiseffect was transferred to GF mice through caecal microbiota transplantation. Wesuggest that the specific microbiota profile of MCJ-KO, characterised by anincrease in the faecal relative abundance of Dorea and Oscillospira genera and a reduction in AF12, Allboaculum and [Ruminococcus], exerted protective actionsthrough enhancing short-chain fatty acids, NAD(+) metabolism and sirtuinactivity, subsequently increasing fatty acid oxidation in GF mice. Importantly,we identified Dorea genus as one of the main modulators of thismicrobiota-dependent protective phenotype. CONCLUSION: Overall, we provideevidence for the relevance of mitochondria-microbiota interplay during NASH, and that targeting it could be a valuable therapeutic approach.

TI  - Insertion sequences and other mobile elements associated with antibioticresistance genes in Enterococcus isolates from an inpatient with prolongedbacteraemia.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000855 [doi]
AB  - Insertion sequences (ISs) and other transposable elements are associated with themobilization of antibiotic resistance determinants and the modulation ofpathogenic characteristics. In this work, we aimed to investigate the associationbetween ISs and antibiotic resistance genes, and their role in the dissemination and modification of the antibiotic-resistant phenotype. To that end, we leveragedfully resolved Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis genomes of isolatescollected over 5 days from an inpatient with prolonged bacteraemia. Isolates fromboth species harboured similar IS family content but showed significantspecies-dependent differences in copy number and arrangements of ISs throughouttheir replicons. Here, we describe two inter-specific IS-mediated recombinationevents and IS-mediated excision events in plasmids of E. faecium isolates. Wealso characterize a novel arrangement of the ISs in a Tn1546-like transposon inE. faecalis isolates likely implicated in a vancomycin genotype-phenotypediscrepancy. Furthermore, an extended analysis revealed a novel associationbetween daptomycin resistance mutations in liaSR genes and a putative compositetransposon in E. faecium, offering a new paradigm for the study of daptomycinresistance and novel insights into its dissemination. In conclusion, our studyhighlights the role ISs and other transposable elements play in the rapidadaptation and response to clinically relevant stresses such as aggressiveantibiotic treatment in enterococci.

TI  - Assessing Intermediate Formation and Electron Competition duringThiosulfate-Driven Denitrification: An Experimental and Modeling Study.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c03937 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing interest in thiosulfate-driven denitrification for low C/Nwastewater treatment, but the denitrification performance varies with thethiosulfate oxidation pathways. Models have been developed to predict theproducts of denitrification, but few consider thiosulfate reduction to elemental sulfur (S(0)), an undesirable reaction that can intensify electron competitionwith denitrifying enzymes. In this study, the model using indirect coupling ofelectrons (ICE) was developed to predict S(0) formation and electron competition during thiosulfate-driven denitrification. Kinetic data were obtained fromsulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) dominated by the branched pathway and were usedto calibrate and validate the model. Electron competition was investigated under different operating conditions. Modeling results reveal that electrons producedin the first step of thiosulfate oxidation typically prioritize thiosulfatereduction, then nitrate reduction, and finally nitrite reduction. However, theelectron consumption rate for S(0) formation decreases sharply with the declineof thiosulfate concentration. Thus, a continuous feeding strategy was effectivein alleviating the competition between thiosulfate reduction and denitrifyingenzymes. Electron competition leads to nitrite accumulation, which could be areliable substrate for anammox. The model was further evaluated with anammoxintegration. Results suggested that the branched pathway and continuous supply ofthiosulfate are favorable to create a symbiotic relationship between SOB andanammox.

TI  - High-Efficiency Photodynamic Antibacterial Activity of NH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2/ZnOTernary Composites.
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.2c00439 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infections are a serious threat to human health, and the development ofeffective antibacterial agents represents a critical solution. In this study,NH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2/ZnO ternary nanocomposites are successfully prepared by afacile wet-chemistry procedure, where MoS2 nanosheets are grown onto the MIL-101 scaffold forming a flower-like morphology with ZnO nanoparticles deposited ontothe surface. The ternary composites exhibit a remarkable sterilizationperformance under visible light irradiation toward both Gram-negative andGram-positive bacteria, eliminating 98.6% of Escherichia coli and 90% ofStaphylococcus aureus after exposure to visible light for 30 min, a performancemarkedly better than that with NH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2 binary composites and evenmore so than MoS2 nanosheets alone. This is ascribed to the unique electronicband structure of the composites, where the separation of the photogeneratedcarriers is likely facilitated by the S-scheme mechanism in theNH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2 binary composites and further enhanced by the formation of ap-n heterojunction between MoS2 and ZnO in the ternary composites. Thisinterfacial charge transfer boosts the effective production of superoxideradicals by the reduction of oxygen, and the disproportionation reaction withwater leads to the formation of hydroxy radicals, as attested in spectroscopicand microscopic measurements. Results from this study highlight the significance of structural engineering of nanocomposites in the manipulation of the electronicband structure and hence the photodynamic activity.

TI  - Bacterial Growth-Induced Tobramycin Smart Release Self-Healing Hydrogel forPseudomonas aeruginosa-Infected Burn Wound Healing.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c05557 [doi]
AB  - Burns are a common health problem worldwide and are highly susceptible tobacterial infections that are difficult to handle with ordinary wound dressings. Therefore, burn wound repair is extremely challenging in clinical practice.Herein, a series of self-healing hydrogels (QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA) with goodelectrical conductivity and antioxidant activity were prepared on the basis ofquaternized chitosan (QCS), oxidized dextran (OD), tobramycin (TOB), andpolydopamine-coated polypyrrole nanowires (PPY@PDA NWs). These Schiff basecross-links between the aminoglycoside antibiotic TOB and OD enable TOB to beslowly released and responsive to pH. Interestingly, the acidic substances duringthe bacteria growth process can induce the on-demand release of TOB, avoiding theabuse of antibiotics. The antibacterial results showed that theQCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel could kill high concentrations of Pseudomonasaeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli in a short time and showed a bactericidal effect for up to 11 days in an agar plate diffusionexperiment, while showing good in vivo antibacterial activity. Excellent andlong-lasting antibacterial properties make it suitable for severely infectedwounds. Furthermore, the incorporation of PPY@PDA endowed the hydrogel withnear-infrared (NIR) irradiation assisted bactericidal activity of drug-resistant bacteria, conductivity, and antioxidant activity. Most importantly, in thePA-infected burn wound model, the QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel more effectivelycontrolled wound inflammation levels and promoted collagen deposition, vasculargeneration, and earlier wound closure compared to Tegaderm dressings. Therefore, the TOB smart release hydrogels with on-demand delivery are extremelyadvantageous for bacterial-infected burn wound healing.

TI  - Epidemiological Comparison of Four COVID-19 Waves in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo, March 2020-January 2022.
LID - 10.1007/s44197-022-00052-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nationwide analyses are required to optimise and tailor activities tocontrol future COVID-19 waves of resurgence continent-wide. We comparedepidemiological and clinical outcomes of the four COVID-19 waves in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: This retrospective descriptiveepidemiological analysis included data from the national line list of confirmedCOVID-19 cases in all provinces for all waves between 9 March 2020 and 2 January 2022. Descriptive statistical measures (frequencies, percentages, case fatalityrates [CFR], test positivity rates [TPR], and characteristics) were comparedusing chi-squared or the Fisher-Irwin test. RESULTS: During the study period,72,108/445,084 (16.2%) tests were positive, with 9,641/56,637 (17.0%),16,643/66,560 (25.0%), 24,172/157,945 (15.3%), and 21,652/163,942 (13.2%) casesduring the first, second, third, and fourth waves, respectively. TPRsignificantly decreased from 17.0% in the first wave to 13.2% in the fourth wave as did infection of frontline health workers (5.2% vs. 0.9%). CFR decreased from 5.1 to 0.9% from the first to fourth wave. No sex- or age-related differences in distributions across different waves were observed. The majority of cases wereasymptomatic in the first (73.1%) and second (86.6%) waves, in contrast to thatin the third (11.1%) and fourth (31.3%) waves. CONCLUSION: Despite fewer reportedcases, the primary waves (first and second) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the DRCwere more severe than the third and fourth waves, with each wave being associatedwith a new SARS-CoV-2 variant. Tailored public health and social measures, andresurgence monitoring are needed to control future waves of COVID-19.

TI  - Cold-adapted strains as plant growth-promoting bacteria on soybean seeds andbiocontrol agents against Macrophomina phaseolina.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15759 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To characterise cold-adapted bacteria by testing their PGP features andantagonistic activity against Macrophomina phaseolina, both in vitro and coating soybean seeds (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). METHODS AND RESULTS: Burkholderiagladioli MB39, Serratia proteamaculans 136 and Serratia proteamaculans 137 wereevaluated. In vitro tests showed that S. proteamaculans 136 and 137 producesiderophore and indole-acetic acid (IAA), solubilise phosphate and fix nitrogen. Additionally, B. gladioli MB39 and S. proteamaculans 137 showed hydrolaseactivity and potent antifungal effects. The biocontrol efficacy over soybeanseeds was evaluated using in vitro and green-house methods by immersing seedsinto each bacterial suspension. As a result, S. proteamaculans 136 has improvedthe performance in all the seed-germination evaluated parameters. In addition, S.proteamaculans 137 and B. gladioli MB39 strongly inhibited M. phaseolina,reducing the infection index values to 10% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION:Serratia proteamaculans 136, 137 and Burkholderia gladioli MB39 showed plantgrowth promotion features and inhibition of Macrophomina phaseolina infection by producing different antifungal compounds. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:Our results reinforce the application of cold-adapted Serratia proteamaculans andBurkholderia gladioli bacterial strains as candidates for developing microbialformulation to promote plant growth and guarantee antifungal protection insoybean crops.

LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-04103-3 [doi]
AB  - In the year 2019-2020, the whole world witnessed the spread of a disease calledCOVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. A number of effective drugs and vaccine has beenformulated to combat this outbreak. For the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs,the main protease (Mpro) is considered a key target as it has rare mutations and plays a crucial role in the replication of the SARS CoV-2. In this study, alibrary of selected lichen compounds was prepared and used for virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using molecular docking, and several hits as potentialinhibitors were identified. Remdesivir was used as a standard inhibitor of Mprofor its comparison with the identified hits. Twenty-six compounds were identifiedas potential hits against Mpro, and these were subjected to in silico ADMETproperty prediction, and the compounds having favorable properties were selected for further analysis. After manual inspection of their interaction with thebinding pocket of Mpro and binding affinity score, four compounds, namely,variolaric acid, cryptostictinolide, gyrophoric acid, and usnic acid, wereselected for molecular dynamics study to evaluate the stability of complex. Themolecular dynamics results indicated that except cryptostictinolide, all thethree compounds made a stable complex with Mpro throughout a 100-ns simulationtime period. Among all, usnic acid seems to be more stable and effective against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In summary, our findings suggest that usnic acid, variolaricacid, and gyrophoric acid have potential to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 Mpro and act as a lead compounds for the development of antiviral drug candidates againstSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endophytic bacteria overlay significant role in plant growthpromotion, eliminating phyto-pathogens and combating stress-conditions. In thepresent study, we aimed to screen high salt tolerant bacteria and study theiradaptive response to elevated salt concentrations. A total of 46 endophyticbacterial isolates from Vigna radiata were screened for salt tolerance. The high salt tolerant endophytic isolate was characterized for alteration in morphology, growth rate, protein profiling, and compatible solute concentrations. RESULTS:The isolate MHN12, based upon biochemical characterization and partial 16S rDNAsequencing identified as B. licheniformis (accession number MG273753) was able totolerate up to 15% NaCl (Sodium Chloride) (2.6 M) concentration. The isolatepossessed 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) activity alongwith indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, ammonia, organic acid and hydrogencyanide (HCN) production. Accumulation of proline was apparent up to 7.5% NaClconcentration and declined afterwards. Ultrastructure analysis using TEM(transmission electron microscopy) revealed the morphological alteration fromrods to filaments. CONCLUSION: Acclimatization to salt stress and plant growthpromoting activities could contribute to utilization of this bacterium asbioinoculant to enhance the crop yield and discourage the application of chemicalfertilizers.

TI  - Vibrio tetraodonis subsp. pristinus subsp. nov., isolated from the coral Acroporacytherea at Palmyra Atoll, and creation and emended description of Vibriotetraodonis subsp. tetraodonis subsp. nov.
LID - 10.1007/s10482-022-01766-0 [doi]
AB  - Strain OCN044(T) was isolated from the homogenised tissue and mucus of anapparently healthy Acropora cytherea coral fragment collected from the westernreef terrace of Palmyra Atoll in the Northern Line Islands and was taxonomically evaluated with a polyphasic approach. The morphological and chemotaxonomicproperties are consistent with characteristics of the genus Vibrio:Gram-stain-negative rods, oxidase- and catalase-positive, and motile by means of a polar flagellum. Strain OCN044(T) can be differentiated as a novel subspeciesbased on 21 differences among chemotaxonomic features (e.g., fatty acidspercentages for C12:0 and C18:1 omega7c), enzymatic activities (e.g., DNase andcystine arylamidase), and carbon sources utilized (e.g., L-xylose andD-melezitose) from its nearest genetic relative. Phylogenetic analysis andgenomic comparisons show close evolutionary relatedness to Vibrio tetraodonisA511(T) but the overall genomic relatedness indices identify strain OCN044(T) as a distinct subspecies. Based on a polyphasic characterisation, differences ingenomic and taxonomic data, strain OCN044(T) represents a novel subspecies of V. tetraodonis A511(T), for which the name Vibrio tetraodonis subsp. pristinussubsp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is OCN044(T) (= LMG 31895(T) = DSM111778(T)).

TI  - Complete genome sequence of virulent genotype I African swine fever virus strain K49 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, isolated from a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus).
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05543-2 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever is one of the most feared infectious diseases in the pigindustry. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an enveloped, cytoplasmicdouble-stranded DNA virus and the only member of the family Asfarviridae.Although ASFV is known to have been circulating on the African continent since atleast 1921, little is known about the genetic characteristics of historical ASFV strains isolated in sub-Saharan Africa. The few complete ASFV genome sequencesobtained from African historical isolates have demonstrated genetic diversity,but the available data are limited and insufficient for fully understanding themolecular evolution and continental spread of ASFV. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the virulent ASFV strain K49, collected during an outbreak in the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1949. Thecomplete genome sequence of ASFV strain K49 was determined using an IlluminaHiSeq platform and is 189,523 bp in length with a mean GC content of 38.43%, with189 genes annotated. This is the first reported complete genome sequence of anASFV serogroup 2 isolate. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated genetic divergencewithin genotype I, and strain K49 formed a separate branch from other ASFVgenotype I isolates.

AB  - Accurate species identification and antibiotic resistance profiling are essentialfor the effective management of infections caused by bacterial pathogens. In thisstudy, 373 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from major hospitals in Trinidad,West Indies, were characterized for resistance against beta-lactam antibioticsand the presence of genes encoding important virulence factors. Most of theisolates showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) activity but few alsodisplayed carbapenemase or 'ESBL + carbapenemase' activities. Polymerase chainreaction analysis revealed the presence of genes for ESBL subtypes blaTEM,blaSHV, and blaCTX-M that were dominant in isolates with the ESBL phenotype aswell as those that did not show ESBL or carbapenemase activities. The carbapenem resistance gene, blaKPC, and the metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) gene, blaNDM-1,were also detected in some of the isolates. Multiple virulence genes were alsodetected, but the fimH-uge was the most common combination found among the local isolates. The findings of this study represent the first comprehensive study onthe prevalence of ESBL, KPC and MBL genes and virulence profiling inantibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae in Trinidad. Furthermore, the occurrence ofmultiple resistant phenotypes and gene combinations were revealed, though at low prevalence rates. This work emphasizes the need to implement molecular-basedtechniques in diagnostic workflows for rapid and accurate species identification and profiling of resistance and virulence genes in K. pneumoniae in Trinidad and Tobago.

PG  - 173
LID - 10.1007/s11274-022-03364-8 [doi]
AB  - Poly-gammaglutamic acid (gammaPGA) produced by Bacillus species is a naturalbiopolymer, which is widely used in various fields including food,pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. In this study, the screening of 19 Bacillusisolates derived from traditionally fermented foods revealed that Bacillusvelezensis VCN56 was the most potent gammaPGA producer. The maximum concentrationof crude gammaPGA was 32.9 +/- 1.5 g/L in the PGA-3 medium containing glycerol,citric acid, sodium glutamate, NH4Cl, and starch. The resulting gamma-PGA waspurified and then characterized by HPLC, FTIR, and (1)H-NMR analyses. Molecularweight of purified gammaPGA was estimated to be 98 kDa with a polydisperse index of 2.04. Notably, the pure gammaPGA showed significant in vitro antioxidantscavenging activities against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (72.0 +/- 1.5%),hydroxyl (81.0 +/- 0.6%), and superoxide (43.9 +/- 0.8%) radicals at theconcentration of 4 mg/mL. Using whole-genome sequencing, the genetic organizationof pgs operon responsible for gammaPGA biosynthesis in B. velezensis VCN56differs from those in other Bacillus genomes. Further genome analysis revealedmetabolic pathways for gamma-PGA production and degradation. For the first time, the present study provides a better understanding of gamma-PGA with a promisingantioxidant activity produced by B. velezensis at the phenotypic, biochemical,and genomic levels, which hold potential applications in the foods, cosmetics,and pharmaceutical industries.

AB  - Due to the highly similar genetic background, it is difficult to distinguishBacillus cereus (B. cereus) with other members of B. cereus group. Herein, anantibody-based colorimetric immunoassay using Cu-doped CeO2 nanospheres asperoxidase mimics was developed for the detection of B. cereus in food. First,monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibody (pAb) with good specificity to B. cereus were prepared and characterized. Second, the regular-shaped hollowCu/CeO2 nanospheres with highly catalytic activity and biocompatibility weresynthesized as mimic nanozymes to capture secondary antibody. Finally, a sandwichcolorimetric immunoassay for the specific and sensitive detection of B. cereuswas developed, showing linear detection range from 3.2 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(5)CFU/mL and a limit detection of 1.7 x 10(2) CFU/mL. The developed immunoassayholds great potential as an effective tool for detecting B. cereus in foodpoisoning.

TI  - Microbial Response to Increased Temperatures Within a Lava-Induced HydrothermalSystem in Iceland: An Analogue for the Habitability of Volcanic Terrains on Mars.
LID - 10.1089/ast.2021.0124 [doi]
AB  - Fossil hydrothermal systems on Mars are important exploration targets becausethey may have once been habitable and could still preserve evidence of microbial life. We investigated microbial communities within an active lava-inducedhydrothermal system associated with the 2014-2015 eruption of Holuhraun inIceland as a Mars analogue. In 2016, the microbial composition in the lava-heatedwater differed substantially from that of the glacial river and spring watersources that fed into the system. Several taxonomic and metabolic groups wereconfined to the water emerging from the lava and some showed the highest sequencesimilarities to subsurface ecosystems, including to the predicted thermophilicand deeply branching Candidatus Acetothermum autotrophicum. Measurements showthat the communities were affected by temperature and other environmentalfactors. In particular, comparing glacial river water incubated in situ (5.7degrees C, control) with glacial water incubated within a lava-heated stream(17.5 degrees C, warm) showed that microbial abundance, richness, and diversityincreased in the warm treatment compared with the control, with the predictedmajor metabolism shifting from lithotrophy toward organotrophy and possiblyphototrophy. In addition, thermophilic bacteria isolated from the lava-heatedwater and a nearby acidic hydrothermal system included the knownendospore-formers Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Paenibacillus cisolokensisas well as a potentially novel taxon within the order Hyphomicrobiales. Similarlava-water interactions on Mars could therefore have generated habitableenvironments for microbial communities.

TI  - Early-onset fulminant neonatal sepsis caused by Multi-Drug Resistant and ESBLproducing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a late-preterm neonate: case report andliterature review.
PG  - 223-226
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a systemic condition characterized by haemodynamic changes andother clinical manifestations due to a presence of pathogenic microorganisms(bacteria, viruses, or fungi) in nor- mally sterile fluid that occurs in aninfant younger than 90 days old. Neonatal sepsis may be divided into two types:early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS).Gram-posi- tive microorganisms are the etiological agents in 62% of EOS, and in43% of the total the identified microorganism is GBS. Gram-negativemicroorganisms comprise 37% of the etiological agents of EOS, of which 29% arecaused by Escherichia coli. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae represent a majorworldwide threat among drug-resistant bacteria in both hospital and communitysettings. ESBLs are often located on large plasmids that also harbour genesresistant to other antimicrobial classes, resulting in multidrug-resistantisolates. Plasmid-encoded ESBLs of the CTX-M-type are increasingly reportedworldwide in Gram-negative rods and now account for most of the ESBLs found inEnterobacteriaceae. We present one case of EOS by Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) and ESBL producing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a neonate born to a mother recentlyimmigrated from Africa. Maternal blood culture grew the same bacteria.

TI  - Alveolar osteitis associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusepidermidis.
PG  - 219-222
AB  - A critical point in dentistry is the empiric prescription of broad-spectrumantibiotics that could increase the levels of antimicrobial resistance. Alveolar osteitis is one of the most common post-op- erative complications in whichantibiotic use is controversial. A 35-year-old female, with pain in the rightmandibular region and treated with cefixime, was diagnosed with cracked toothsyndrome and pulpitis. The tooth was extracted and a massive purulent bleedingdrainage was observed. Irrigation of the socket and a new therapy withazithromycin were done. Bacteriological analysis, a specific mecA gene PCR forthe methicillin resistance, and the antimicrobial susceptibility test were per-formed on the bacterial isolate. A Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate wasmethicillin-resistant and showed resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin,clarithromycin, and sulfamethoxazole + trimeth- oprim. After 7 days, intraoralexamination showed a complete resolution. The aim of this report is to suggestthat systemic antibiotics may provide insufficient efficacy during alveolarosteitis, especially when caused by a multidrug-resistant organism.

AB  - We evaluated the in vitro activity of eravacycline and cefoperazone/sulbactamagainst 42 XDR and 58 PDR Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from blood andbronchoalveolar infections. The minimum and maximum MICs for eravacycline were0.125 and 4 mg/L, respectively. The MIC50 was 2 mg/L and the MIC90 was 3 mg/L.The minimum and maximum MICs for cefoperazone/sulbactam were 24 and >256 mg/L,respectively. The MIC50 and MIC90 were both >256 mg/L. These novel agents werenot adequate for the treatment of A. baumannii infections in our hospital and we recommend that mi- crobiology laboratories perform their own evaluations beforeincluding them in clinical practice.

TI  - Identification of a novel mutation involved in colistin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based approaches.
PG  - 199-209
AB  - The spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producingbacteria (KPC) is one of the most serious threats to global public health. Due tothe limited antibiotic options, colis- tin often represents a therapeutic choice.In this study, we performed Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) by Illumina andNanopore platforms on four colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates (CoRKp) toexplore the resistance profile and the mutations involved in colistin resistance.Mapping reads with reference sequence of the most com- mon genes involved incolistin resistance did not show the presence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr)genes in all CoRKp. Complete or partial deletions of mgrB gene were observed inthree out of four CoRKp, while in one CoRKp the mutation V24G on phoQ wasidentified. Complementation assay with proper wild type genes restored colistinsusceptibility, validating the role of the amino acid substitution V24G and, asalready described in the literature, confirming the key role of mgrB alterations in colistin resistance. In conclusion, this study allowed the identification ofthe novel mutation on phoQ gene involved in colistin resistance phenotype.

TI  - Lasting Effects of Helicobacter pylori Infection on the Microbial Communities of Patients with and without Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth.
PG  - 193-198
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) microbial populations are important in maintaining normalfunctioning of the GI by preventing disorders. Dysbiotic microbiota may increase the likelihood of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a syndromeassociated with significant morbidity. We aimed to inves- tigate the microbiotapopulations of patients with SIBO. Patients with symptoms of SIBO wereconsecutively enrolled; they underwent a SIBO hydrogen breath test and stool was collected for microbiome analysis by sequencing of the 16S rRNA. Of the 55patients recruited, 42 (76.4%) were positive for SIBO. When visualizing thebacterial beta-di- versity, a sub-cluster of patients was identified. Furtherexamination of these patients' records re- vealed previous treatment forHelicobacter pylori (HP). Microbiome analysis of these patients demonstrated asignificant decrease in beta-diversity (p-value<0.001) compared to patientswithout previous HP therapy. Furthermore, beta-diversity was significantlydifferent in this subgroup, and sev- eral bacterial taxa were differentiallyexpressed, including one from the genus Methanobrevibacter, which was reduced in patients that previously underwent HP treatment. Our findings suggest that while symptoms associated with SIBO may cause dysbiosis, there was no differentiationin fecal microbiome composition based on SIBO diagnosis. Furthermore, our resultssupport previous observations regarding antibiotic-altered microbiota witheffects extending two and three years post-treatment.

TI  - Evaluation of the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT for detection of carbapenemases inGram-negative bacilli.
PG  - 190-192
AB  - Enterobacterales as opportunistic pathogens are commonly associated withnosocomial infections. With increasing frequency, Gram-negative bacilli,especially Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, are mul- tidrug-resistant orpandrug-resistant. Carbapenems were used as the drugs of choice for the treat-ment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. The aimof this study was to assess the usefulness of the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT for therapid detection and identification of the most important carbapenemases (OXA-48, KPC, NDM, VIM) in Enterobacterales bacilli. The study involved the isolates of 97Enterobacterales strains. The ability to produce carbapenemases was determined bythe immunochromatographic RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test. This test detectedcarbapenemases OXA-48, KPC, NDM, and VIM. For the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test, apositive result was obtained for 93 strains (95.9%). Four strains negative in theRESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT were positive in the Eazyplex(R)SuperBugCRE and PCR.These strains produce VIM enzymes. RE- SIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test is rapid,simple to perform and can be used for fast detection of the most importantcarbapenemases (OXA-48, KPC, NDM, VIM) among Gram-negative bacilli.

LID - e78129 [pii]
AB  - Biogeographical studies have traditionally focused on readily visible organisms, but recent technological advances are enabling analyses of the large-scaledistribution of microscopic organisms, whose biogeographical patterns have longbeen debated. Here we assessed the global structure of plankton geography and itsrelation to the biological, chemical, and physical context of the ocean (the'seascape') by analyzing metagenomes of plankton communities sampled acrossoceans during the Tara Oceans expedition, in light of environmental data andocean current transport. Using a consistent approach across organismal sizes thatprovides unprecedented resolution to measure changes in genomic compositionbetween communities, we report a pan-ocean, size-dependent plankton biogeography overlying regional heterogeneity. We found robust evidence for a basin-scaleimpact of transport by ocean currents on plankton biogeography, and on acharacteristic timescale of community dynamics going beyond simple seasonality orlife history transitions of plankton.

OAB - Oceans are brimming with life invisible to our eyes, a myriad of species ofbacteria, viruses and other microscopic organisms essential for the health of theplanet. These 'marine plankton' are unable to swim against currents and shouldtherefore be constantly on the move, yet previous studies have suggested thatdistinct species of plankton may in fact inhabit different oceanic regions.However, proving this theory has been challenging; collecting plankton islogistically difficult, and it is often impossible to distinguish between speciessimply by examining them under a microscope. However, within the last decade, aresearch schooner called Tara has travelled the globe to gather thousands ofplankton samples. At the same time, advances in genomics have made it possible toidentify species based only on fragments of their DNA sequence. To understand thehidden geography of plankton communities in Earth's oceans, Richter et al. pored over DNA from the Tara Oceans expedition. This revealed that, despite beingunable to resist the flow of water, various planktonic species which live closeto the surface manage to occupy distinct, stable provinces shaped by currents.Different sizes of plankton are distributed in different sized provinces, withthe smallest organisms tending to inhabit the smallest areas. Comparing DNAsimilarities and speeds of currents at the ocean surface revealed how these mightstretch and mix plankton communities. Plankton play a critical role in the healthof the ocean and the chemical cycles of planet Earth. These results could allowdeeper investigation by marine modellers, ecologists, and evolutionarybiologists. Meanwhile, work is already underway to investigate how climate changemight impact this hidden geography.

TI  - The inhibitory effect of paeoniflorin on reactive oxygen species alleviates theactivation of NF-kappaB and MAPK signalling pathways in macrophages.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001210 [doi]
AB  - Paeoniflorin (PF) has been proven to possess a protective effect in someinflammatory diseases, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Macrophages play central roles in inflammatory responses and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7macrophage is an ideal model for studying the anti-inflammatory effects andmechanisms of drugs. Thus, it was used to explore the anti-inflammatory mechanismof PF in this study. The results showed that PF markedly attenuated theactivation of NF-kappaB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38mitogen activated protein kinase (p38) signalling pathways induced by LPSexposure. In addition, PF pretreatment dose-dependently suppressed the productionof cytokines and the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS). Concomitantly, PF pretreatment dramatically inhibited the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) without affecting thephagocytosis of macrophages. Furthermore, it has proved the scavenging effect of PF on ROS was involved in the anti-inflammatory process. This study provides anovel aspect to the understanding of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PF.

TI  - Direct visualization of sequence-specific DNA binding by gonococcal type IV pili.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001224 [doi]
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhoea, is a major burden onglobal healthcare systems, with an estimated ~80-90 million new global casesannually. This burden is exacerbated by increasing levels of antimicrobialresistance, which has greatly limited viable antimicrobial therapies. Decreasing gonococcal drug susceptibility has been driven largely by accumulation ofchromosomal resistance determinants, which can be acquired through naturaltransformation, whereby DNA in the extracellular milieu is imported into cellsand incorporated into the genome by homologous recombination. N. gonorrhoeaepossesses a specialized system for DNA uptake, which strongly biasestransformation in favour of DNA from closely related bacteria by recognizing a10-12 bp DNA uptake sequence (DUS) motif, which is highly overrepresented intheir chromosomal DNA. This process relies on numerous proteins, including theDUS-specific receptor ComP, which assemble retractile protein filaments termedtype IV pili (T4P) extending from the cell surface, and one model for neisserial DNA uptake proposes that these filaments bind DNA in a DUS-dependent mannerbefore retracting to transport DNA into the periplasm. However, conflictingevidence indicates that elongated pilus filaments may not have such a direct rolein DNA binding uptake as this model suggests. Here, we quantitatively measuredDNA binding to gonococcal T4P fibres by directly visualizing binding complexeswith confocal fluorescence microscopy in order to confirm the sequence-specific, comP-dependent DNA binding capacity of elongated T4P fibres. This supports theidea that pilus filaments could be responsible for initially capturing DNA in thefirst step of sequence-specific DNA uptake.

TI  - Screening of osmotic stress-tolerant bacteria for plant growth promotion in wheat(Triticum aestivum L.) and brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) under droughtconditions.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13797 [doi]
AB  - Drought stress adversely affects plant growth and productivity. Therefore, theapplication of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) is a viable option forcombating drought resistance in crops. In this study, 144 bacteria were isolated from the Kutch desert soil in Gujarat. Based on osmotic stress tolerance and PGP properties, two strains, Bacillus tequilensis (KS5B) and Pseudomonas stutzeri(KS5C) were tested for their effect on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and brinjal(Solanum melongena L.) under drought stress conditions. Inoculation with osmotic stress-tolerant bacteria showed 15.15-29.27% enhancement in root length of wheat and 15.27-32.59% in brinjal plants. Similarly, the enhancement of shoot lengthranged from 14.72-37.70% for wheat and 59.39-95.94% for brinjal plants.Furthermore, the inoculated plants showed significant improvement in chlorophyll content and antioxidant properties such as proline, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase activity compared the control. Therefore, the bacterial strainsidentified in this study can be used to mitigate drought stress and enhance plantbiomass.

TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae imports spermidine by a member of the aminoacid/polyamine antiporter family to endure citric acid stress at the vaginal pH.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001219 [doi]
AB  - Polyamines bind to various cellular components, such as nucleic acids,phospholipids, proteins and nucleotides. They are involved in the virulence andprotection against physiological stresses of several bacterial species.Streptococcus agalactiae is able to colonize the vaginal tract of asymptomaticpregnant women and to resist, by an as yet poorly characterized mechanism, pH4.0, the low physiological pH of this environment. We identified a transporter ofthe amino acid/polyamine antiporter family (SAK_1604 in strain A909) that shares 39.8 % similar amino acids with CadB and 34.7 % with PotE, two transportersimplicated in acid resistance in Escherichia coli. We found that sak_1604 isoverexpressed in the presence of spermidine and during citric acid stress at the vaginal pH, but not during lactic acid or HCl stresses at the same pH or during asodium citrate stress at pH 7.4. Dihydrogen citrate is the predominant form ofcitric acid at pH 4.0. Using a deletion mutant, we proved that SAK_1604 isinvolved in the survival of S. agalactiae during citric acid stress at pH 4.0 in the presence of spermidine, and we showed by TLC analysis that it is involved in spermidine transport in these conditions. Our data open new perspectives on thecomprehension of the molecular mechanisms allowing S. agalactiae to survive atthe physiological pH of the vagina and on the unsuspected role of an ionic formof citric acid.

TI  - Identification of bacteriophage genome sequences with representation learning.
LID - btac509 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac509 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Bacteriophages/Phages are the viruses that infect and replicatewithin bacteria and archaea. Phages are used to therapeutically provide anotherpotential solution for solving antibiotic resistance, which is one of the threatsto global health. To develop phage therapies, the identification of phages frommetagenome sequences is the first step. Currently, there are two main methods foridentifying phages: database-based (alignment-based) methods and alignment-freemethods. Database-based methods typically use a large number of sequences asreferences; alignment-free methods usually learn the features of the sequenceswith machine learning and deep learning models. RESULTS: We propose INHERIT whichuse a deep representation learning model to integrate both database-based andalignment-free methods, combining the strengths of both. Pre-training is used as an alternative way of acquiring knowledge representations from existingdatabases, while the BERT-style deep learning framework retains the advantage of alignment-free methods. We compare INHERIT with four existing methods on athird-party benchmark dataset. Our experiments show that INHERIT achieves abetter performance with the F1-score of 0.9932. In addition, we find thatpre-training two species separately helps the non-alignment deep learning modelmake more accurate predictions. AVAILABILITY: The codes of INHERIT are nowavailable in: https://github.com/Celestial-Bai/INHERIT. SUPPLEMENTARYINFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Allele-specific alternative splicing of Drosophila Ribosomal protein S21suppresses a lethal mutation in the Phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (Phax) gene.
LID - jkac195 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkac195 [doi]
AB  - Genetic disruptions to the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclearribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) in Drosophila cause wide-spread alternative splicing changes, including changes to the splicing of pre-mRNA for Ribosomal protein S21 (RpS21). Using a transposon mutant for the Phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (Phax) gene, we demonstrate that changes in the splicing of RpS21 transcriptshave a strong influence on the developmental progression of PhaxSH/SH mutants.Different alleles of the Drosophila RpS21 gene are circulating in commonlaboratory strains and cell lines. These alleles exhibit differences in RpS21intron retention and splicing efficiency. Differences in the splicing of RpS21transcripts accounts for prior conflicting observations of the phenotypicseverity of PhaxSH/SH mutant stocks. The alleles uncover a strong splicingenhancer in RpS21 transcripts that can fully suppress the larval lethality andpartially suppress the pupal lethality exhibited by PhaxSH/SH mutant lines. Inthe absence of the splicing enhancer, the splicing of RpS21 transcripts can bemodulated in trans by the SR-rich B52 splicing factor. As PhaxSH/SH mutantsexhibit wide-spread splicing changes in transcripts for other genes, findingshere establish the importance of a single alternative splicing event, RpS21splicing or intron retention, to the developmental progression of Drosophila.

PG  - e0020222
LID - 10.1128/jb.00202-22 [doi]
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis encodes two proteins, AcpA and AcpB, having thecharacteristics of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). We report that the acpA genelocated in the fatty acid synthesis operon is essential for fatty acid synthesis and the DeltaacpA strain requires unsaturated fatty acids for growth. TheDeltaacpA strain could be complemented by a plasmid carrying a wild-type acpAgene, but not by a plasmid carrying a wild-type acpB gene. Substitution of fourAcpA residues for those of AcpB resulted in a protein that modestly complemented the DeltaacpA strain and restored fatty acid synthesis, although the acyl chains synthesized were unusually short. IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecalis, as well asrelated species, has two genes-acpA and acpB-encoding putative acyl carrierproteins (ACPs). It has been assumed that AcpA is essential for fatty acidsynthesis whereas AcpB is involved utilization of environmental fatty acids. Wereport here the first experimental test of the essentiality of acpA and show thatit is indeed an essential gene that cannot be replaced by acpB.

PG  - e0025322
LID - 10.1128/aac.00253-22 [doi]
AB  - Taniborbactam, an investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor that is active againstboth serine- and metallo-beta-lactamases, is being developed in combination with cefepime to treat serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Anticipating the use of cefepime-taniborbactam in patients withimpaired renal function, an open-label, single-dose clinical study was performed to examine the pharmacokinetics of both drugs in subjects with various degrees ofrenal function. Hemodialysis-dependent subjects were also studied to examine the amounts of cefepime and taniborbactam dialyzed. Single intravenous infusions of 2g cefepime and 0.5 g taniborbactam coadministered over 2 h were examined, withhemodialysis-dependent subjects receiving doses both on- and off-dialysis. Nosubjects experienced serious adverse events or discontinued treatment due toadverse events. The majority of adverse events observed were mild in severity,and there were no trends in the safety of cefepime-taniborbactam related todeclining renal function or the timing of hemodialysis. Clinically significantand similar decreases in drug clearance with declining renal function wereobserved for both cefepime and taniborbactam. The respective decreases ingeometric mean clearance for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renalimpairment compared to subjects with normal renal function were 18%, 63%, and 78%for cefepime and 15%, 63%, and 81% for taniborbactam, respectively. Decreases in clearance were similar for both drugs and were shown to be proportional todecreases in renal function. Both cefepime and taniborbactam were dialyzable,with similar amounts removed during 4 h of hemodialysis. This study is registeredat ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03690362.

TI  - Passive Immunization with a Single Monoclonal Neutralizing Antibody Protectsagainst Cutaneous and Mucosal Mouse Papillomavirus Infections.
PG  - e0070322
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00703-22 [doi]
AB  - We have established a mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) model that induces bothcutaneous and mucosal infections and cancers. In the current study, we use thismodel to test our hypothesis that passive immunization using a singleneutralizing monoclonal antibody can protect both cutaneous and mucosal sites at different time points after viral inoculation. We conducted a series ofexperiments involving the administration of either a neutralizing monoclonalantibody, MPV.A4, or control monoclonal antibodies to both outbred and inbredathymic mice. Three clinically relevant mucosal sites (lower genital tract forfemales and anus and tongue for both males and females) and two cutaneous sites(muzzle and tail) were tested. At the termination of the experiments, all tested tissues were harvested for virological analyses. Significantly lower levels ofviral signals were detected in the MPV.A4-treated female mice up to 6 hpost-viral inoculation compared to those in the isotype control. Interestingly,males displayed partial protection when they received MPV.A4 at the time of viralinoculation, even though they were completely protected when receiving MPV.A4 at 24 h before viral inoculation. We detected MPV.A4 in the blood starting at 1 hand up to 8 weeks postadministration in some mice. Parallel to these in vivostudies, we conducted in vitro neutralization using a mouse keratinocyte cellline and observed complete neutralization up to 8 h post-viral inoculation. Thus,passive immunization with a monoclonal neutralizing antibody can protect against papillomavirus infection at both cutaneous and mucosal sites and is timedependent. IMPORTANCE This is the first study testing a single monoclonalneutralizing antibody (MPV.A4) by passive immunization against papillomavirusinfections at both cutaneous and mucosal sites in the same host in the mousepapillomavirus model. We demonstrated that MPV.A4 administered before viralinoculation can protect both male and female athymic mice against MmuPV1infections at cutaneous and mucosal sites. MPV.A4 also offers partial protection at 6 h post-viral inoculation in female mice. MPV.A4 can be detected in the bloodfrom 1 h to 8 weeks after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Interestingly, males were only partially protected when they received MPV.A4 at the time of viralinoculation. The failed protection in males was due to the absence ofneutralizing MPV.A4 at the infected sites. Our findings suggest passiveimmunization with a single monoclonal neutralizing antibody can protect againstdiverse papillomavirus infections in a time-dependent manner in mice.

TI  - Phage Resistance Accompanies Reduced Fitness of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli inthe Urinary Environment.

LID - 10.1128/msphere.00345-22 [doi]
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common infections treatedworldwide each year and is caused primarily by uropathogenic Escherichia coli(UPEC). Rising rates of antibiotic resistance among uropathogens have spurred aconsideration of alternative treatment strategies, such as bacteriophage (phage) therapy; however, phage-bacterial interactions within the urinary environment arepoorly defined. Here, we assess the activity of two phages, namely, HP3 and ES17,against clinical UPEC isolates using in vitro and in vivo models of UTI. In both bacteriologic medium and pooled human urine, we identified phage resistancearising within the first 6 to 8 h of coincubation. Whole-genome sequencingrevealed that UPEC strains resistant to HP3 and ES17 harbored mutations in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. Phage-resistant strainsdisplayed several in vitro phenotypes, including alterations to adherence to and invasion of human bladder epithelial HTB-9 cells and increased biofilm formation in some isolates. Interestingly, these phage-resistant UPEC isolates demonstratedreduced growth in pooled human urine, which could be partially rescued bynutrient supplementation and were more sensitive to several outermembrane-targeting antibiotics than parental strains. Additionally,phage-resistant UPEC isolates were attenuated in bladder colonization in a murineUTI model. In total, our findings suggest that while resistance to phages, suchas HP3 and ES17, may arise readily in the urinary environment, phage resistanceis accompanied by fitness costs which may render UPEC more susceptible to hostimmunity or antibiotics. IMPORTANCE UTI is one of the most common causes ofoutpatient antibiotic use, and rising antibiotic resistance threatens the abilityto control UTI unless alternative treatments are developed. Bacteriophage (phage)therapy is gaining renewed interest; however, much like with antibiotics,bacteria can readily become resistant to phages. For successful UTI treatment, wemust predict how bacteria will evade killing by phage and identify the downstreamconsequences of phage resistance during bacterial infection. In our currentstudy, we found that while phage-resistant bacteria quickly emerged in vitro,these bacteria were less capable of growing in human urine and colonizing themurine bladder. These results suggest that phage therapy poses a viable UTItreatment if phage resistance confers fitness costs for the uropathogen. Theseresults have implications for developing cocktails of phage with multipledifferent bacterial targets, of which each is evaded only at the cost ofbacterial fitness.

AB  - Natural and human-made disasters can cause tremendous physical damage, societalchange, and suffering. In addition to their effects on people, disasters havebeen shown to alter the microbial population in the area affected. Alterationsfor microbial populations can lead to new ecological interactions, withadditional potentially adverse consequences for many species, including humans.Disaster-related stressors can be powerful forces for microbial selection.Studying microbial adaptation in disaster sites can reveal new biologicalprocesses, including mechanisms by which some microbes could become pathogenicand others could become beneficial (e.g., used for bioremediation). Here wesurvey examples of how disasters have affected microbiology and suggest that the topic of "disaster microbiology" is itself a new field of study. Given theaccelerating pace of human-caused climate change and the increasing encroachment of the natural word by human activities, it is likely that this area of research will become increasingly relevant to the broader field of microbiology. Sincedisaster microbiology is a broad term open to interpretation, we propose criteriafor what phenomena fall under its scope. The basic premise is that there must be a disaster that causes a change in the environment, which then causes analteration to microbes (either a physical or biological adaptation), and thatthis adaptation must have additional ramifications.

TI  - Synthetic Genetic Interactions Reveal a Dense and Cryptic Regulatory Network ofSmall Noncoding RNAs in Escherichia coli.

LID - 10.1128/mbio.01225-22 [doi]
AB  - Over the past 20 years, we have learned that bacterial small noncoding RNAs(sRNAs) can rapidly effect changes in gene expression in response to stress.However, the broader role and impact of sRNA-mediated regulation in promotingbacterial survival has remained elusive. Indeed, there are few examples wheredisruption of sRNA-mediated gene regulation results in a discernible change inbacterial growth or survival. The lack of phenotypes attributable to loss of sRNAfunction suggests that either sRNAs are wholly dispensable or functionalredundancies mask the impact of deleting a single sRNA. We investigated syntheticgenetic interactions among sRNA genes in Escherichia coli by constructingpairwise deletions in 54 genes, including 52 sRNAs. Some 1,373 double deletionstrains were studied for growth defects under 32 different nutrient stressconditions and revealed 1,131 genetic interactions. In one example, we identifieda profound synthetic lethal interaction between ArcZ and CsrC when E. coli wasgrown on pyruvate, lactate, oxaloacetate, or d-/l-alanine, and we provideevidence that the expression of ppsA is dysregulated in the double deletionbackground, causing the conditionally lethal phenotype. This work employs aunique platform for studying sRNA-mediated gene regulation and sheds new light onthe genetic network of sRNAs that underpins bacterial growth. IMPORTANCE sRNAshave long been purported to be a critical mechanism by which bacteria respond to stress; however, uncovering growth phenotypes for sRNA deletion strains in E.coli and related bacteria has proven particularly challenging. In contrast, thedeletion of hfq, a chaperone required for the activity of many sRNAs in E. coli, results in striking growth defects in E. coli under a variety of mediumconditions and chemical stressors. Here, we examined the importance of hfq andsRNA deletion strains for E. coli growth in nutrient-limited medium supplemented with 30 different carbon sources. We then systematically combined sRNA deletionmutations, creating a library of 1,373 sRNA double deletion strains, which wescreened for growth under the same conditions, yielding 43,936 individual growth measurements. Our data uncovered more than 1,000 growth phenotypes for sRNAdouble deletion strains, shedding light on complicated networks of sRNAregulation that underpin bacterial survival under nutrient stress.

LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.2c00299 [doi]
AB  - The WHO estimates an average of 10 million deaths per year due to the increasing number of infections and the predominance of drug resistance. To improve clinicaloutcomes and contain the spread of infections, the development of newerdiagnostic tools is imperative to reduce the time and cost involved to reach the farthest population. The current study focuses on the development of apoint-of-care technology that uses crystal violet entrapped, lectinfunctionalized chitosan nanoparticles to detect the presence of clinicallyrelevant bacterial infections. Spherical nanoparticles of <200 nm in diametermake up the biosensing nanomaterial, showed specific clumping in the presence of bacteria to form visible aggregates as compared to a nonbacterial sample. Visibleagglutination confirmed the presence of bacteria in the samples. The devicesrequire just 100 muL of sample and were tested with various bacteria-spikedsaline, simulated urine, artificial sputum, and simulated respiratory and woundswabs. The developed device did not require any sample preparation orsophisticated instruments while enabling rapid differentiation between bacterial and nonbacterial infections within 10 min. The in vitro results withbacteria-spiked simulated samples reveal 100% sensitivity and specificity with a limit of detection of 10(5) cfu/mL. The nanomaterial developed was found to bestable for more than 90 days at accelerated conditions. The developed device can be a screening tool for home-based or clinical assessment and follow thetreatment accordingly, reducing exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics in thecase of nonbacterial infections.

TI  - The Sixth Element: a 102-kb RepABC Plasmid of Xenologous Origin ModulatesChromosomal Gene Expression in Dinoroseobacter shibae.
PG  - e0026422
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00264-22 [doi]
AB  - The model organism Dinoroseobacter shibae and many other marine Rhodobacterales(Roseobacteraceae, Alphaproteobacteria) are characterized by a multipartitegenome organization. Here, we show that the original isolate (Dshi-6) containedsix extrachromosomal replicons (ECRs), whereas the strain deposited at the DSMZ(Dshi-5) lacked a 102-kb plasmid. To determine the role of the sixth plasmid, we investigated the genomic and physiological differences between the two strains.Therefore, both genomes were (re)sequenced, and gene expression, growth, andsubstrate utilization were examined. For comparison, we included additionalplasmid-cured strains in the analysis. In the Dshi-6 population, the conjugative 102-kb RepABC-9 plasmid was present in only about 50% of the cells, irrespective of its experimentally validated stability. In the presence of the sixth plasmid, copy number changes of other ECRs, in particular, a decrease of the 86-kbplasmid, were observed. The most conspicuous finding was the strong influence of plasmids on chromosomal gene expression, especially the repression of the CtrAregulon and the activation of the denitrification gene cluster. Expression isinversely controlled by either the presence of the 102-kb plasmid or the absence of the 86-kb plasmid. We identified regulatory genes on both plasmids, i.e., asigma 70 factor and a quorum sensing synthase, that might be responsible forthese major changes. The tremendous effects that were probably evenunderestimated challenge the current understanding of the relevance of volatileplasmids not only for the original host but also for new recipients afterconjugation. IMPORTANCE Plasmids are small DNA molecules that replicateindependently of the bacterial chromosome. The common view of the role ofplasmids is dominated by the accumulation of resistance genes, which isresponsible for the antibiotic crisis in health care and livestock breeding.Beyond rapid adaptations to a changing environment, no general relevance for the host cell's regulome was attributed to these volatile ECRs. The current studyshows for the model organism D. shibae that its chromosomal gene expression isstrongly influenced by two plasmids. We provide evidence that the gain or loss ofplasmids not only results in minor alterations of the genetic repertoire but alsocan have tremendous effects on bacterial physiology. The central role of someplasmids in the regulatory network of the host could also explain theirpersistence despite fitness costs, which has been described as the "plasmidparadox."

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs) cause diseases known asmycobacteriosis and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Thediagnosis of pulmonary disease caused by NTM is hampered by its clinicalsimilarity with tuberculosis (TB) and by the lack of an accurate and rapidlaboratory diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: Detect DNA from NTMs directly from lung samplesusing real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for amplification of 16S rRNA.Additionally, DNA sequencing (hsp65 and rpoB genes) was used to identify thespecies of MNTs. METHODS: A total of 68 sputum samples (54 with suspected NTMsand 14 with TB) from patients treated at a referral hospital were used. FINDINGS:Of these, 27/54 (50%) were qPCR positive for NTMs and 14/14 TB patients(controls) were qPCR negative with an almost perfect concordance (Kappa of 0.93) with the Mycobacterium spp. culture. Sequencing confirmed the presence of NTM in all positive samples. The most common species was Mycobacterium gordonae (33%),followed by Mycobacterium abscessus (26%), Mycobacterium fortuitum (22%),Mycobacterium avium (15%) and Mycobacterium peregrinum (4%). MAIN CONCLUSIONS:The qPCR technique for detecting NTMs targeting 16S rRNA has the potential todetect NTMs and rapidly differentiate from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However,it is necessary to identify the species to help in the differential diagnosisbetween disease and contamination, and to guide the choice of the therapeuticscheme.

AB  - Temporary waters are common environments found in physical and biologicalsubstrates. Among them, some bromeliads species are known to hold water in their tanks, in a habitat called phytotelmata. Phytotelmata serve as habitats forseveral organisms, from bacteria and protists to arthropods and anurans.Peritrich ciliates are often found as epibionts on aquatic invertebrates in theseenvironments. Here, we report two cases of epibiosis involving Lagenophrys sp.attached to ostracods (Elpidium spp.) and Rhabdostyla sp. colonizing hydrachnidmites in the tanks of two bromeliad species. In our analysis, we measured thefrequency of epibiosis considering the presence of both basibiont and epibiont inthe samples. The results shown a significant difference between Elpidium sp. and Lagenophrys sp. compared to hydrachnid mites and Rhabdostyla sp. (87.5% and 19%, respectively), supported by the Kruskal-Walis test (p = 0.0003, Chi-square =9.687). These reports are important since the knowledge of phytotelmatacommunities from tropical and subtropical areas is incipient, although it hasbeen increasing over the last years. It also shows that epibiosis doesn't always represent a beneficial relationship. These two epibiosis systems found inbromeliad tanks raise questions about organism's dispersal throughout otherphytotelmata and other temporary water habitats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The increase in antibiotic resistance (AR) is a global phenomenon withregional variation. This survey aims to describe the AR in urine cultures ofwomen from the community in a southern Brazil city. METHODS: A retrospectivecross-sectional single-center study in urine cultures of community dwellingindividuals. The main outcome was the AR profile of bacterial isolates from womenin outpatient care. RESULTS: From 4,011 urine cultures, 524 were positive (91%from women). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (E.coli) (67.0%) and Klebsiella spp. (19.4%). E. coli presented low resistance tonitrofurantoin (3.7%), moderate to levofloxacin (15.6%), amoxacillin-clavulonate (16.4%) and ciprofloxacin (17.4%), and high to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(26.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Nitrofurantoin seems to be the best choice for theempirical treatment of low urinary tract infections in women, whereassulfonamides are no longer an option, since E. coli resistance to this drug isabove 20%.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the levels of environmentalcontamination in a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. For this, two areaswere chosen along the Mearim River: the reference area (A1) and the potentiallycontaminated area (A2), where water samples were collected, for physicochemicaland microbiological analyses, as well as specimens of Hoplias malabaricus, forthe evaluation of biometric data and incidence of branchial lesions. Thephysicochemical analyzes of the water from both areas showed contamination (lowlevels of dissolved oxygen, tubidity and high iron concentrations, especially in A2). The microbiological analyzes showed that all water samples showed totalcoliform values higher than those acceptable by CONAMA and WHO (with highervalues in A2), in addition to E. coli values higher than those allowed bylegislation in A2. Regarding biometric data, male and female fishes weresignificantly longer and heavier in A1 during the dry and rain seasons and thegonadosomatic index also showed higher values in A1 than in A2 in both seasons.H. malabaricus showed gill lesions of minimal to moderate pathological importancein A1 and A2, indicating that specimens from both areas of the Mearim Rivershowed biological responses to contamination. The observed changes in the waterquality, bimetic parameters and the histological analyzes of the specimens of H. malabaricus directly reflect on the quality and health of the fishes in theMearim River, and point to the urgent need for prevention and remediation ofcontamination in these ecosystems.

AB  - Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) such as vaginal candidiasis and bacterialvaginosis (BV) are common among sexually active women and can be both symptomaticor asymptomatic. The microbiota of the reproductive tract triggers immuneresponse at the cervicovaginal interface resulting in secretion of cytokinesduring the course of these RTIs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytokine profile in cervicovaginal lavage of women having asymptomatic vaginalinfections. Measurement of vaginal cytokines was done for various interleukinsincluding IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12/IL23p40, IL-17A, tumour necrosisfactor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) by ProcartaPlexMultiplex Immunoassay. Women having vaginal Candida infection had increasedconcentration of IL-1beta (p=.01), IL-6 (p=.007), IL-8 (p=.327), IL-12/IL23p40(p=.049) and IFN-gamma (p=.125). The results of our study suggest that evaluationof these cytokines could be explored as an additional measure to determine hostinflammatory response in women having asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis.ImpactStatementWhat is already known on this subject? Studies assessing the vaginalcytokine profile to assess the vaginal milieu in various cohorts such aspost-menopausal women, pregnant women, women with history of preterm birth, CINand scheduled IVF cycle are being undertaken. Variable cytokine response has beenreported in literature in women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis and Candida infection. However, much less is known about vaginal cytokine profile inasymptomatic infection.What do the results of this study add? The results of the study show increased concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta,IL-6 IL-8, IL-12/IL23p40 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in women havingasymptomatic Candida, vaginal leucocytosis and raised vaginal pH.What are theimplications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?Evaluation of vaginal cytokine profile (IL-1beta, IL-6 IL-8, IL-1beta,IL-12/IL23p40 and IFN-gamma) could be explored as an additional measure todetermine inflammation in asymptomatic women. Vaginal cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-12/IL23p40 and IFN-gamma) could be used further fordevelopment of a point of care test.

TI  - A NIR-II light-modulated injectable self-healing hydrogel for synergisticphotothermal/chemodynamic/chemo-therapy of melanoma and wound healing promotion.
LID - 10.1039/d2tb00923d [doi]
AB  - The development of an injectable multifunctional hydrogel with tumor therapy,antibacterial treatment and wound healing properties is essential forsimultaneously eradicating melanoma and promoting wound healing oftumor-initiated skin defects. Herein, iron ion-doped polyaniline (PANI(Fe))tethered with guar gum (GG) chains is employed for the first time as a buildingunit for constructing a superior hydrogel (GG@PANI(Fe)-borax) crosslinked byborate/didiol bonds. Due to the dynamic and reversible properties of boronateester bonds, the GG@PANI(Fe)-borax hydrogels had convenient injectability, rapid self-healing ability, and reversible gel-sol transformations under thermal- orpH-stimuli. More importantly, they took advantage of the second near-infrared(NIR-II) responsive photothermal conversion capability, accompanied by thephotothermal-enhanced high cytotoxic OH generation in the H2O2-enriched tumormicroenvironment induced by iron-doped PANI. The as-prepared hydrogels exhibited excellent photothermal effects and controllable NIR-triggered drug release,leading to distinctly synergistic photothermal/chemodynamic/chemo-therapy effectsof melanoma both in vitro (98.2%) and in vivo (98.8%). In addition, the obtained hydrogels also exhibited good anti-bacterial activity (>97.1%) against bothGram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli)bacteria because they were based on PANI(Fe) and borax, which exhibitantibacterial activity. Furthermore, these GG@PANI(Fe)-incorporated scaffoldscould improve fibroblast cell proliferation and angiogenesis for acceleratingwound repair in tumor-bearing and infected wound mice. Taken together,GG@PANI(Fe)-borax hydrogels may be used simultaneously for eradication ofskin-tumor cells, inhibiting infection and accelerating wound healing. This work offers an effective and facile strategy to fabricate an "all-in-one"multifunctional hydrogel platform for synergetic multimodal integrated therapy oftumors.

TI  - Detection of trh(+) Vibrio parahaemolyticus in seafood by lac dyecoloration-based label-free lateral flow immunoassay strip.
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13692 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) is an important foodborne pathogen known to cause severe enteric disease. Thus, timely detection of V.parahaemolyticus in seafood is crucial to prevent food poisoning and reduceeconomic losses. Traditional lateral flow immunoassay strips (LFIS) required goodlabelling materials and pairing of two antibodies, which made them costly anddifficult to manufacture. In this study, a label-free and lac dyecoloration-based LFIS (LD-LFIS) to detect trh(+) V. parahaemolyticus wasdeveloped for the first time. Lac dye was used to stain V. parahaemolyticus, and LFIS was used to detect stained bacteria. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) andsimultaneous mordanting were chosen as the best solvent and the best stainingmethod for lac dye. In addition, three mordants [KAl(SO4 )2 .12H2 O, NH4 Fe(SO4)2 .12H2 O, and AlCl3 .6H2 O] were selected to improve dyeing efficiency. Thedetection limit of LD-LFIS was 3.9 x 10(5) CFU/ml when NH4 Fe(SO4 )2 .12H2 O was used as mordant. Feasibility of the LD-LFIS method was verified by detectingtrh(+) V. parahaemolyticus in true and spiked seafood samples. The methoddeveloped in this study is expected to reduce restrictions on labelling materialsand pairing of two antibodies on LFIS, and proposes a novel idea for the rapiddetection of V. parahaemolyticus in seafood.

TI  - Molecular basis of anti-CRISPR operon repression by Aca10.
LID - gkac656 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac656 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems are bacterial defense systems for fighting against invaderssuch as bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements. To escape destruction bythese bacterial immune systems, phages have co-evolved multiple anti-CRISPR (Acr)proteins, which inhibit CRISPR-Cas function. Many acr genes form an operon withgenes encoding transcriptional regulators, called anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca)proteins. Aca10 is the most recently discovered Aca family that is encoded withinan operon containing acrIC7 and acrIC6 in Pseudomonas citronellolis. Here, wereport the high-resolution crystal structure of an Aca10 protein to unveil themolecular basis of transcriptional repressor role of Aca10 in theacrIC7-acrIC6-aca10 operon. We identified that Aca10 forms a dimer in solution,which is critical for binding specific DNA. We also showed that Aca10 directlyrecognizes a 21 bp palindromic sequence in the promoter of the acr operon.Finally, we revealed that R44 of Aca10 is a critical residue involved in the DNA binding, which likely results in a high degree of DNA bending.

AB  - Despite advances in bacterial genome engineering, delivery of large syntheticconstructs remains challenging in practice. In this study, we propose astraightforward and robust approach for the markerless integration of DNAfragments encoding whole metabolic pathways into the genome. This approach relieson the replacement of a counterselection marker with cargo DNA cassettes vialambdaRed recombineering. We employed a counterselection strategy involving agenetic circuit based on the CI repressor of lambda phage. Our design ensureselimination of most spontaneous mutants, and thus provides a counterselectionstringency close to the maximum possible. We improved the efficiency ofintegrating long PCR-generated cassettes by exploiting the Ocr antirestrictionfunction of T7 phage, which completely prevents degradation of unmethylated DNAby restriction endonucleases in wild-type bacteria. The employment of highlyrestrictive counterselection and ocr-assisted lambdaRed recombineering allowedmarkerless integration of operon-sized cassettes into arbitrary genomic loci offour enterobacterial species with an efficiency of 50-100%. In the case ofEscherichia coli, our strategy ensures simple combination of markerless mutationsin a single strain via P1 transduction. Overall, the proposed approach can serve as a general tool for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering in a range ofbacterial hosts.

LID - gkac643 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac643 [doi]
AB  - Cold shock adaptability is a key survival skill of gut bacteria of warm-bloodedanimals. Escherichia coli cold shock responses are controlled by a complexmulti-gene, timely-ordered transcriptional program. We investigated itsunderlying mechanisms. Having identified short-term, cold shock repressed genes, we show that their responsiveness is unrelated to their transcription factors or global regulators, while their single-cell protein numbers' variability increasesafter cold shock. We hypothesized that some cold shock repressed genes could betriggered by high propensity for transcription locking due to changes in DNAsupercoiling (likely due to DNA relaxation caused by an overall reduction innegative supercoiling). Concomitantly, we found that nearly half of cold shockrepressed genes are also highly responsive to gyrase inhibition (albeit mostgenes responsive to gyrase inhibition are not cold shock responsive). Further,their response strengths to cold shock and gyrase inhibition correlate.Meanwhile, under cold shock, nucleoid density increases, and gyrases and nucleoidbecome more colocalized. Moreover, the cellular energy decreases, which mayhinder positive supercoils resolution. Overall, we conclude that sensitivity todiminished negative supercoiling is a core feature of E. coli's short-term, cold shock transcriptional program, and could be used to regulate the temperaturesensitivity of synthetic circuits.

AB  - Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) is an important pathogen, leading to the occurrence ofviral diarrhoea . As the infection displays obvious enterotropism, intestinalmucosal immunity is the significant line of defence against pathogen invasion.Moreover, as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show acid resistance, bile saltresistance and immune regulation, it is of great significance to develop an oral vaccine. Most traditional plasmid delivery vectors use antibiotic genes asselective markers, easily leading to antibiotic accumulation. Therefore, toselect a food-grade marker in genetically engineering food-grade microorganismsis vital. Based on the CRISPR-Cas9D10A system, we constructed a stableauxotrophic Lactobacillus paracasei HLJ-27 (Lactobacillus big up tri, openAlrHLJ-27) strain. In addition, as many plasmids replicate in the host bacteria,resulting in internal gene deletions. In this study,we used atemperature-sensitive gene editing plasmidto insert the VP4 gene into the genome,yielding the insertion mutant strains VP4/ big up tri, openAlr HLJ-27, VP4/ bigup tri, openAlr W56, and VP4/W56. This recombinant bacterium efficiently induced secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses. These oral mucosal vaccines have the potential to actas an alternative to the application of antibiotics in the future and induceefficient immune responses against PEDV infection.

TI  - Effects of boric acid and potassium metaborate on cytokine levels and redoxstress parameters in a wound model infected with methicillinresistantStaphylococcus aureus.
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2022.12809 [doi]
LID - 294 [pii]
AB  - Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are usually found inhospital settings and, frequently, in patients with open wounds. One of the most critical virulence factors affecting the severity and recurrence of infections isthe biofilm; increasing antibiotic resistance due to biofilm formation has led tothe search for alternative compounds to antibiotics. The present study aimed touse boric acid and potassium metaborate against MRSA infection in a fibroblastwound model. For this purpose, a twopart experiment was designed: First, MRSAstrains were used for the test, and both boric acid and potassium metaborate wereprepared in microdilution. In the second step, an MRSA wound model was preparedusing a fibroblast culture, and treatments with boric acid and potassiummetaborate were applied for 24 h. For the evaluation of the effects of treatment,cell viability assay (MTT assay), analysis of redox stress parameters, including total oxidant status and total antioxidant capacity analyses, lactatedehydrogenase analysis and immunohistochemical staining were performed. Inaddition, IL1beta and IL10 gene expression levels were assayed. According to the results, potassium metaborate was more effective and exhibited a lower toxicityto fibroblast cells compared to boric acid; moreover, potassium metaboratedecreased the level of prooxidant species and increased the antioxidant statusmore effectively than boric acid. The IL1beta level in the bacteria group washigh; however, boric acid and potassium metaborate significantly decreased theexpression levels of inflammatory markers, exhibiting the potential to improvethe resolution of the lesion. On the whole, the findings of the present studysuggest that boric acid and potassium metaborate may be effective on the testedmicroorganisms.

TI  - Phylogenomic evidence for the Origin of Obligately Anaerobic Anammox Bacteriaaround the Great Oxidation Event.
LID - msac170 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msac170 [doi]
AB  - The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria can transform ammonium andnitrite to dinitrogen gas, and this obligate anaerobic process accounts for up tohalf of the global nitrogen loss in surface environments. Yet its origin andevolution, which may give important insights into the biogeochemistry of earlyEarth, remains enigmatic. Here, we performed comprehensive phylogenomic andmolecular clock analysis of anammox bacteria within the phylum Planctomycetes.After accommodating the uncertainties and factors influencing time estimates,which includes implementing both a traditional cyanobacteria-based and a recentlydeveloped mitochondria-based molecular dating approach, we estimated a consistentorigin of anammox bacteria at early Proterozoic and most likely around theso-called Great Oxidation Event (GOE; 2.32 to 2.5 billion years ago [Ga]) whichfundamentally changed global biogeochemical cycles. We further showed that duringthe origin of anammox bacteria, genes involved in oxidative stress adaptation,bioenergetics and anammox granules formation were recruited, which might havecontributed to their survival on an increasingly oxic Earth. Our findings suggestthe rising levels of atmospheric oxygen, which made nitrite increasinglyavailable, was a potential driving force for the emergence of anammox bacteria.This is one of the first studies that link the GOE to the evolution of obligateanaerobic bacteria.

TI  - Production of 5-aminolevulinic acid from hydrolysates of cassava residue and fishwaste by engineered Bacillus cereus PT1.
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.14118 [doi]
AB  - The economical production of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has recently receivedincreasing attention for its extensive use in agriculture. In this study, astrain of Bacillus cereus PT1 could initially produce ALA at a titre of 251.72mg/L by using a hydrolysate mixture of low-cost cassava residue and fish waste.The integration of endogenous hemA encoding glutamyl-tRNA reductase led to a39.30% increase in ALA production. Moreover, improving cell permeability bydeletion of the LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) family gene tagU led to a further increase of59.73% in ALA production. Finally, the engineered strain B. cereusPT1-hemA-DeltatagU produced 2.62 g/L of ALA from the previously mentionedhydrolysate mixture in a 7-L bioreactor. In a pot experiment, foliar spray of theALA produced by B. cereus PT1-hemA-DeltatagU from the hydrolysates increased salttolerance of cucumber by improving chlorophyll content and catalase activity,while decreasing malondialdehyde content. Overall, this study demonstrated aneconomic way to produce ALA using a microbial platform and evidenced thepotential of ALA in agricultural application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The commercially available Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines weredeveloped based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates genetically divergentfrom field strains that can only prevent clinical disease, not shedding ofvirulent heterologous virus, highlighting the need to develop genotype-matchedvaccines. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the efficacy of the NDVgenotype-matched vaccine, mIBS025 strain formulated in standard vaccinestabilizer, and in carboxymethyl sago starch-acid hydrogel (CMSS-AH) followingvaccination via an eye drop (ED) and drinking water (DW). METHODS: A challengevirus was prepared from a recent NDV isolated from ND vaccinated flock. Groups ofspecific-pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with mIBS025 vaccine strainprepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer and CMSS-AH via ED and DW and thenchallenged with the UPM/NDV/IBS362/2016 strain. RESULTS: Chickens vaccinated withCMSS-AH mIBS025 ED (group 2) developed the earliest and highest Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) NDV antibody titer (8log2) followed by standard mIBS025 ED (group3) (7log2) both conferred complete protection and drastically reduced virusshedding. By contrast, chickens vaccinated with standard mIBS025 DW (group 5) andCMSS-AH mIBS025 DW (group 4) developed low HI NDV antibody titers of 4log2 and3log2, respectively, which correspondingly conferred only 50% and 60% protection and continuously shed the virulent virus via the oropharyngeal and cloacal routesuntil the end of the study at 14 dpc. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of mIBS025vaccines prepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer or CMSS-AH was affected by thevaccination routes. The groups vaccinated via ED had better protective immunitythan those vaccinated via DW.

TI  - Modulating streptococcal phenotypes using signal peptide analogues.
PG  - 220143
LID - 10.1098/rsob.220143 [doi]
AB  - Understanding bacterial communication mechanisms is imperative to improve ourcurrent understanding of bacterial infectivity and find alternatives to currentmodes of antibacterial therapeutics. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negativebacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate group behaviours and associatedphenotypes in a cell-density-dependent manner. Group behaviours, phenotypicexpression and resultant infection and disease can largely be attributed toefficient bacterial communication. Of particular interest are the communicationmechanisms of Gram-positive bacteria known as streptococci. This group hasdemonstrated marked resistance to traditional antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality of infected hosts and an ever-increasing burdenon the healthcare system. Modulating circuits and mechanisms involved instreptococcal communication has proven to be a promising anti-virulencetherapeutic approach that allows managing bacterial phenotypic response but does not affect bacterial viability. Targeting the chemical signals bacteria use forcommunication is a promising starting point, as manipulation of these signals candramatically affect resultant bacterial phenotypes, minimizing associatedmorbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the use of modified peptidesignals in modulating the development of proliferative phenotypes in differentstreptococcal species, specifically regarding how such modification can attenuatebacterial infectivity and aid in developing future alternative therapeuticagents.

TI  - 'omics-guided prediction of the pathway for metabolism of isoprene by Variovorax sp. WS11.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16149 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria which inhabit soils and the leaves of trees partially mitigate therelease of the abundant volatile organic compound, isoprene(2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). While the initial steps of isoprene metabolism wereidentified in Rhodococcus sp. AD45 two decades ago, the isoprene metabolicpathway still remains largely undefined. Limited understanding of the functionsof isoG, isoJ and aldH, and uncertainty in the route of isoprene-derived carboninto central metabolism have hindered our understanding of isoprene metabolism.These previously uncharacterised iso genes are essential in Variovorax sp. WS11, determined by targeted mutagenesis. Using combined 'omics-based approaches, wepropose the complete isoprene metabolic pathway. Isoprene is converted topropionyl-CoA which is assimilated by the chromosomally-encoded methylmalonyl-CoApathway, requiring biotin and vitamin B12, with the plasmid-encoded methylcitratepathway potentially providing robustness against limitations in these vitamins.Key components of this pathway were induced by both isoprene and its initialoxidation product, epoxyisoprene, the principal inducer of isoprene metabolism inboth Variovorax sp. WS11 and Rhodococcus sp. AD45. Analysis of the genomes ofdistinct isoprene-degrading bacteria indicated that the genetic components of themethylcitrate and methylmalonyl-CoA pathways are not always present in isoprenedegraders, although incorporation of isoprene-derived carbon via propionyl-CoAand acetyl-CoA is universally indicated.

TI  - Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar viciae strains are natural wheat endophytesthat can stimulate root development.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16148 [doi]
AB  - Although rhizobia that establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with legumes arealso known to promote growth in non-legumes, studies on rhizobial associationswith wheat roots are scarce. We searched for Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovarviciae (Rlv) strains naturally competent to endophytically colonize wheat roots. We isolated 20 strains from surface-sterilized wheat roots, and found a lowdiversity of Rlv compared to that observed in the Rlv species complex. We tested the ability of a subset of these Rlv for wheat root colonization whenco-inoculated with other Rlv. Only a few strains, including those isolated fromwheat roots, and one strain isolated from pea nodules, were efficient incolonizing roots in co-inoculation conditions, while all the strains tested insingle strain inoculation conditions were found to colonize the surface andinterior of roots. Furthermore, Rlv strains isolated from wheat roots were ableto stimulate root development and early arbuscular mycorrhizal fungicolonization. These responses were strain and host genotype dependent. Ourresults suggest that wheat can be an alternative host for Rlv; nevertheless,there is a strong competition between Rlv strains for wheat root colonization. Inaddition, we showed that Rlv are endophytic wheat root bacteria with potentialability to modify wheat development.

TI  - Genetic diversity of honeybee colonies predicts gut bacterial diversity ofindividual colony members.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16150 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota of social bees is relatively simple and dominated by a set of core taxa found consistently in individuals around the world. Yet, variationremains, and can affect host health. We characterised individual- andregional-scale variation in honeybee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiota from 64colonies in North-West England by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and asked whether microbiota were influenced by host genotype and landscapecomposition. We also characterised the genotypes of individual bees and the land cover surrounding each colony. The literature-defined core taxa dominated across the region despite the varied environments. However, there was variation in therelative abundance of core taxa, and colony membership explained much of thisvariation. Individuals from more genetically diverse colonies had more diversemicrobiotas, but individual genetic diversity did not influence gut microbialdiversity. There were weak trends for colonies in more similar landscapes to havemore similar microbiota, and for bees from more urban landscapes to have lessdiverse microbiota. To our knowledge, this is the first report for any speciesthat the gut bacterial communities of individuals are influenced by the genotypesof others in the population.

TI  - A tale of two plasmids: contributions of plasmid associated phenotypes toepidemiological success among Shigella.
PG  - 20220581
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.0581 [doi]
AB  - Dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes by horizontal gene transfer(HGT) mediated through plasmids is a major global concern. Genomic epidemiologystudies have shown varying success of different AMR plasmids during outbreaks,but the underlying reasons for these differences are unclear. Here, weinvestigated two Shigella plasmids (pKSR100 and pAPR100) that circulated in thesame transmission network but had starkly contrasting epidemiological outcomes toidentify plasmid features that may have contributed to the differences. We usedplasmid comparative genomics to reveal divergence between the two plasmids ingenes encoding AMR, SOS response alleviation and conjugation. Experimentalanalyses revealed that these genomic differences corresponded with reducedconjugation efficiencies for the epidemiologically successful pKSR100, but moreextensive AMR, reduced fitness costs, and a reduced SOS response in the presence of antimicrobials, compared with the less successful pAPR100. The discrepantphenotypes between the two plasmids are consistent with the hypothesis thatplasmid-associated phenotypes contribute to determining the epidemiologicaloutcome of AMR HGT and suggest that phenotypes relevant in responding toantimicrobial pressure and fitness impact may be more important than those aroundconjugation in this setting. Plasmid phenotypes could thus be valuable tools inconjunction with genomic epidemiology for predicting AMR dissemination.

LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03303 [doi]
AB  - Acinetobacter johnsonii is one of the major food-spoilage bacteria and cansurvive under cold stress. In this study, the membrane composition, membranepermeability, and energy transduction of A. johnsonii XY27 cultured at 4 and 30degrees C were examined comparatively by flow cytometry combined with liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. TheNa(+)/K(+)ATPase activity, alkaline phosphatase and ATPase activity, fluorescenceintensity, and cell viability in A. johnsonii XY27 increased with the decrease incultivation temperature. The polyunsaturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fattyacids have a higher content in A. johnsonii XY27 cultured at 4 degrees C comparedto that cultured at 30 degrees C, in which the contents of methyl palmitoleate,methyl myristoleate, and methyl oleate increased dramatically with decreasingtemperature. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed that 31 proteins weredownregulated and 4 proteins were upregulated, in which catalase-peroxidase 1 andcold shock proteins as biomarker proteins could effectively control A. johnsonii during cold adaptation.

LID - 10.1039/c3sc53426j [doi]
AB  - Multi-elemental, isotope selective nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry(NanoSIMS) combined with confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used tocharacterize the subcellular distribution of (15)N-labeled cisplatin in humancolon cancer cells. These analyses indicated predominant cisplatin colocalisationwith sulfur-rich structures in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore,colocalisation of platinum with phosphorus-rich chromatin regions was observed,which is consistent with its binding affinity to DNA as the generally acceptedcrucial target of the drug. Application of (15)N-labeled cisplatin and subsequentmeasurement of the nitrogen isotopic composition and determination of therelative intensities of platinum and nitrogen associated secondary ion signals indifferent cellular compartments with NanoSIMS suggested partial dissociation ofPt-N bonds during the accumulation process, in particular within nucleoli atelevated cisplatin concentrations. This finding raises the question as to whetherthe observed intracellular dissociation of the drug has implications for themechanism of action of cisplatin. Within the cytoplasm, platinum mainlyaccumulated in acidic organelles, as demonstrated by a direct combination ofspecific fluorescent staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy and NanoSIMS.Different processing of platinum drugs in acidic organelles might be relevant fortheir detoxification, as well as for their mode of action.

AB  - Rickettsial diseases (RD) are a group of endotheliotropic infectious diseasescaused by different species of genera Rickettsia. RD are not an uncommon disease and may be misdiagnosed during the evaluation of acute febrile illness due to alack of reliable serological marker and diagnostic culture methods. Clinicalmanifestation of RD varies from febrile illness with rashes and myalgia to fatal complications such as shock and respiratory failure. We describe a case of ayoung male who presented initially with acute febrile illness, followed by shock and respiratory failure, and unfortunately succumbed to death. A post-mortemexamination showed histological features of endotheliotropic infection, such asinterstitial / perivascular edema in various organs and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (suggesting increased vascular permeability) and evidence of vasculitis in the lung, liver, and intestines. Molecular studies performed from lung, liver,and kidney tissue confirm the diagnosis of spotted fever group rickettsialdisease due to Rickettsia conorii.

PG  - 149-153

AB  - Due to the high prevalence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, combination therapy is an efficient choice for treatment of infections caused by highly resistantstrains. In this study, the efficacy of ceftiofur plus danofloxacin combinationwas investigated against resistant Escherichia coli. The interaction between the two drugs was determined by checkerboard tests and time-kill assays. Thecombination was defined as bactericidal or bacteriostatic based on the minimumbactericidal concentration test results. Mutant prevention concentration test wasused to evaluate the resistance tendency suppression potential of thecombination. The combination had a synergistic effect against 83.00% of theisolates as verified by the checkerboard and time-kill assays. The combinationwas defined as bactericidal against all E. coli strains, since minimumbactericidal concentration: minimum inhibitory concentration ratios were belowfour thresholds and also markedly reduced mutant prevention concentration values of ceftiofur up to 4000-fold compared to its single use. Ceftiofur plusdanofloxacin combination inhibited growth of E. coli strains which were resistantto ceftiofur or newer generation of fluoroquinolones. Our results suggest thatceftiofur plus danofloxacin combination has a bactericidal characteristic and canbe an important alternative for the treatment of infections caused by resistantE. coli.

AB  - The study was designed to explore anatomical and histological vasculature changesin the female genital system of camel and serological aspects that might beresponsible to maintain thermoregulation. Twenty-four adult female camels weresampled during breeding (November-April) and non-breeding (May-October) season.Blood was collected for estrogen, progesterone and cortisol level estimation.Genital organs were sampled and described after slaughtering. Samples were taken from the ovarian artery (OA), vein (OV) and arterio-venous complex (AVC), forlight and scanning electron microscopy. Sections were stained with Hematoxylinand Eosin. (H&E), Masson's trichrome, Weigert's elastic and toluidine blue.Temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate stress indicator. Stressindicator was higher in non-breeding season (NBS). Anatomical and histologicalvasculature (OA, OV, AVC) dynamics were significantly higher in breeding season(BS) especially diameter of left OA. Parameters of OA were positively associated with estrogen level. Collagen, elastic, smooth muscles and mast cells wererecorded least in BS compared to NBS. Unique venous structure, intra-muralvenules (IMV), was discovered in tunica intima of OA, seen positively andnegatively associated with estrogen and cortisol level in BS, respectively.Scanned electron-micrograph exhibited penetration and wrapping of OA by smallthinned-walled venules that may form IMV. The AVC was too tightly packed todifferentiate due to the collapse of the wall. Hormonal, seasonal, stressindicator and vascular dynamic of female genital system are interlinked and IMVin association with OA and OV may be proposed as the site of counter-currentexchange in female reproductive system of the camel.

AB  - Piglets suffer from diarrhea caused by the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli(STEC) and can be carriers of the bacteria, with public health consequences indeveloping countries. The aim of the present study was to study the prevalence ofSTEC O157 in feces of 465 piglets and 54 food mixes from backyard systems, theantimicrobial susceptibility of STEC and the frequency of genes encodingextended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The E. coli was isolated from 75.90 % of theevaluated feces. The STEC strains were identified in 33.11% of the sampledpopulation and in 43.60% of the piglets carrying E. coli. Among STEC strains, thestx1 gene was the most frequent (22.30%). The rfbO157 gene was amplified in47.40% of the STEC strains. High frequencies of STEC strains were not susceptibleto ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline. The blaTEM gene (52) was the most frequent among strains not susceptible to ampicillin. Class 1 integrons were the most frequent in those strains. Of the identified STEC strains, 48.70% wereconsidered as multi-drug resistant and 1.90% were considered extensively drugresistant. In the supplied food, STEC O157 strains were identified in 25.00% ofthe STEC strains. We conclude that the piglets from backyard systems are carriersof STEC O157 strains not susceptible to common antibiotics, including penicillinsand tetracyclines. In addition, supplied food is a source of this type ofpathogenic bacteria. Through their direct contact with humans, the piglets andfood represent a potential source of bacterial dissemination capable of producinggastrointestinal infections in humans.

AB  - Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is an oncogenic retrovirus of the genusDeltaretrovirus. The genome of BLV encodes a cluster of 10 mature microRNAs(miRNAs). Considering the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene expression, it seems that each of the miRNAs of BLV plays a vital role in the process ofpathogenesis and tumorigenesis of the virus. First, sequences of each of themiRNAs of BLV were selected and downloaded from the miRBase database. Thesequences were then investigated using TargetScan and miRWalk to identify target genes of each of the mature miRNAs of the virus. Second, the expression levels ofthe two miRNAs with the highest number of target genes in B lymphocytes andlymphoid tissues were evaluated using qPCR and were compared between cattle with different forms of BLV infection: PL form was compared to aleukemic (AL) form(Group 1) and BLV+ with normal lymph nodes were compared to lymphosarcoma form(Group 2). We identified a total of 1595 target genes of the micro RNAs. ThemiRNAs with the highest target genes included miR-B4-3p with 760 and B2-5p with102 target genes. In the second phase, miRNA expression in BLV-infected animalswas investigated. The Fold Change (FC) values for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p ingroup 1 were 22 and 67, respectively. In the second group, the FCs for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p were 47 and 133, respectively. The expression was significantlyhigher in persistent lymphocytosis (PL) cattle in group one and lymphosarcomacattle in group two.

AB  - Otitis externa is an inflammatory disease of the external ear canal; atherapeutic alternative is the controlled-flux electrolyzed acidic solution(SAEFC) with bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties. The purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate the clinical and cytological efficacies of SAEFC in otitis externa. A total of 30 dogs were examined. The clinical and cytologicalevaluations were on days 1, 7 and 14; the following was considered: Pain,erythema, exudate, inflammation, ulcers, putrid odor and pigmentation.Cytological evaluations were carried out to examine the presence ofpolymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), intra-cellular bacteria (cocci; IC),extra-cellular bacteria (EC) and yeasts on days 1, 7 and 14. A cotton swabsaturated with SAEFC was applied for each dog's ear. The values of PMN diminishedhaving a significant difference between days. The presence of IC (cocci) had adifference in evaluations from day 1 to day 7 and from day 7 to day 14demonstrating an important drop. The evaluation of pain showed a sustaineddecrease until reaching 95.00% of remission, erythema diminished 68.33%, theexudate dropped to 90.00%, inflammation was no longer present by day 14 in 78.00%of the cases and 21.67% showed a slight inflammation, the putrid odor dropped to 95.00% and 5.00% presented a mild odor and by day 14 ear pigmentation was nolonger present in 51.67% of the cases and the 48.33% had slight pigmentation. Theuse of SAEFC is an effective alternative treatment in dogs with otitis externa.

TI  - Selonsertib Enhances Kidney Protection Beyond Standard of Care in a Hypertensive,Secondary Glomerulosclerosis CKD Model.
PG  - 1169-1182
LID - 10.34067/KID.0001032022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Despite widespread use of renin-aldosterone-angiotensin systeminhibitors and the benefits of lowering glomerular pressure in patients with CKD,there remains a major unmet need for therapies targeting underlying causes of CKDprogression. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) promotes apoptosis andglomerulosclerosis, and is implicated in the progression of diabetic kidneydisease (DKD), a major cause of CKD. Selonsertib is a selective ASK1 inhibitorcurrently in clinical development for the treatment of DKD. We examined the addedbenefits of selonsertib on existing glomerulosclerosis and related molecularpathways in the nondiabetic 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) rat model in combinationwith the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats underwent 5/6 Nx with kidney biopsy 8 weeks later forassessment of glomerulosclerosis, and were randomized to four treatment groupswith equal glomerulosclerosis: selonsertib, enalapril, combination (selonsertibplus enalapril), and untreated controls. Serum creatinine, systolic BP (SBP), andurinary albumin were measured at intervals. Animals were euthanized at week 12for histologic, biochemical, and molecular analyses. Results: All rats developed hypertension, albuminuria, and glomerulosclerosis by week 8. Kidney functionfurther declined, and glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria progressively increased in controls from week 8 to 12. Enalapril treatment alone from week 8 to 12reduced SBP versus controls, decreased albuminuria, and resulted in numericallylower glomerulosclerosis. Selonsertib alone had no effect on SBP but preservedkidney function. Combined treatment significantly reduced glomerulosclerosis,with more regression than either monotherapy. Enalapril treatment resulted infewer interstitial macrophages, whereas selonsertib treatment reduced apoptosisand podocyte loss. RNA-seq revealed that combined treatment influenced pathwaysrelated to extracellular matrix and wound healing. Conclusions: Selonsertibtargets a novel, nonhemodynamic pathway in CKD. Our data suggest that ASK1inhibition, when combined with ACEI, has additive effects to reduce progressionof glomerulosclerosis, attenuate kidney function decline, and reduce podocyteloss.

AB  - In the bone marrow, plasma cells are made up of B lymphocytes and are a type ofWBC. These plasma cells produce antibodies that help to keep bacteria and virusesat bay, thus preventing inflammation. This presents a major challenge forsegmenting blood cells, since numerous image processing methods are used beforesegmentation to enhance image quality. White blood cells can be analyzed by apathologist with the aid of computer software to identify blood diseasesaccurately and early. This study proposes a novel model that uses the ResNet and UNet networks to extract features and then segments leukocytes from bloodsamples. Based on the experimental results, this model appears to perform well,which suggests it is an appropriate tool for the analysis of hematology data. By evaluating the model using three datasets consisting of three different types of WBC, a cross-validation technique was applied to assess it based on the publicly available dataset. The overall segmentation accuracy of the proposed model wasaround 96%, which proved that the model was better than previous approaches, suchas DeepLabV3+ and ResNet-50.

AB  - In order to investigate the influencing factors of AAD in the emergency ward and the clinical effect of probiotics, 100 AAD patients admitted to the emergencyward of our hospital from January 2021 to January 2022 and 100 healthy physicalexamination subjects are selected for conducting clinical trials. The subjectsare, respectively, included in the AAD group and the healthy group. By using the random number table method, 100 patients in the AAD group are randomly dividedinto the probiotic group and traditional group, with 50 patients in each group.The traditional group receives conventional treatment, and the probiotic group istreated with Clostridium caseinate bifidobacterial probiotics additionally.Multivariate logistic analysis is performed on the risk factors for AAD, and the comparison of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the intestinal microflora of the different groups before and after treatment isconducted. The experimental result reveals that probiotics treatment for AADpatients can reduce inflammatory response and promote intestinal colonization of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria.

AB  - Objective: To calculate prescribed daily doses (PDDs) for selected antimicrobialsand evaluate application of defined daily doses (DDDs) using an antimicrobialpurchasing dataset. Animals: Data from dogs and cats treated for bacterialcystitis at a veterinary practice network were evaluated. Procedure: A datasetcontaining antimicrobial prescriptions for dogs and cats diagnosed with bacterialcystitis was evaluated. Median dose and frequency and median weight of treatedanimals were used to calculate PDDs. To account for differences in use betweendogs and cats, an adjusted DDD was calculated based on adjustment forproportional use in dogs versus cats. Results: PDDs for dogs and cats weredetermined and adjusted DDDs were calculated and applied to an antimicrobialpurchasing dataset from 886 veterinary clinics, demonstrating the differencebetween mass-based and DDD data. Conclusions: DDDs can be estimated usingprescription datasets, accounting for differences in weights (between and within species) and relative use between dogs and cats. These can be applied to broader (sales, purchase) datasets to provide a more detailed understanding of howantimicrobials are used. Clinical relevance: DDDs could be a useful measure forassessing mass-based antimicrobial use datasets as part of antimicrobialstewardship surveillance efforts.

TI  - Multi-modality imaging and therapeutics used in a case of canine spinalnephroblastoma.
PG  - 811-818
AB  - A 4-year-old castrated male golden retriever dog was brought to a veterinaryteaching hospital for evaluation of acute progressive paraparesis. Neurologicalexamination indicated a spinal cord lesion between the third thoracic vertebraand third lumbar vertebrae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed anintradural, extra medullary, and/or intramedullary mass centered over theeleventh and twelfth thoracic disc space. The dog underwent cytoreductive surgeryand histopathologic analysis diagnosed a nephroblastoma. Following this, the dog underwent multimodal therapy, including multiple surgeries, 2 courses ofradiation, and combination chemotherapy. The dog had serial restaging using MRI, computed tomography (CT), and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emissiontomography/computed tomography throughout the course of therapy. The dog survived350 d from date of first presentation until humane euthanasia was elected due to worsening of neurologic status. During postmortem examination, extensiveinfiltration of the spinal cord by nephroblastoma cells was discovered as well aspulmonary metastatic disease. Key clinical message: Based on the literaturesearch, this is the first case in which surgery, radiation therapy, andchemotherapy were all used for the treatment of canine spinal nephroblastoma.This case report details the aggressive nature of a case of canine spinalnephroblastoma despite multi-modal therapy.

TI  - Laboratory investigation of cases of fatal bacterial pneumonia in dairy cows.
PG  - 845-850
AB  - Objective: Bacterial bronchopneumonia occurs in mature dairy cows but much of theinformation is extrapolated from knowledge of the disease in calves. The studywas prompted by perceptions of an increasing occurrence and a paucity ofinformation on fatal Mannheimia haemolytica pneumonia in dairy cows in Ontario.The study objectives were to describe the seasonality, main pathogens involved,and suggested predisposing factors for cases of fatal bacterial bronchopneumonia in mature dairy cows submitted for postmortem examination to a diagnosticlaboratory, and to evaluate if the frequency of such submissions has increasedover time. Animals: Mature dairy cows. Procedure: Retrospective study of casessubmitted for postmortem examination to a diagnostic laboratory from 2007-2020that were diagnosed as bacterial bronchopneumonia. Results: Most of thepostmortem cases of bacterial bronchopneumonia in dairy cows were submitted from November to February (54% of cases). Mannheimia haemolytica was isolated fromlung of 61/101 cases. Viruses were only identified in 8/55 cases tested. Aminority (29/92) of bacterial isolates had in vitro resistance to antimicrobials used to treat pneumonia. Frequently suggested predisposing factors includedrecent introductions or movement of animals, recent or imminent calving,inclement weather, concurrent diseases, and poor ventilation in barns. Conclusionand clinical relevance: This study describes seasonal and annual trends, majorpathogens, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and suggested predisposing factors in Ontario dairy cows submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for postmorteminvestigation of pneumonia and provides insights for understanding why outbreaks occur.

TI  - Simultaneous Raman and infrared spectroscopy: a novel combination for studyingbacterial infections at the single cell level.
PG  - 8171-8179
LID - 10.1039/d2sc02493d [doi]
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical condition responsible for approximately 11 million deaths worldwide. Rapid and accurate identification of pathogenicbacteria and its antimicrobial susceptibility play a critical role in reducingthe morbidity and mortality rates related to sepsis. Raman and infraredspectroscopies have great potential to be used as diagnostic tools for rapid and culture-free detection of bacterial infections. Despite numerous reports usingboth methods to analyse bacterial samples, there is to date no study collectingboth Raman and infrared signatures from clinical samples simultaneously due toinstrument incompatibilities. Here, we report for the first time the use of anemerging technology that provides infrared signatures via optical photothermalinfrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectra simultaneously. We use thisapproach to analyse 12 bacterial clinical isolates including six isolates ofGram-negative and six Gram-positive bacteria commonly associated with bloodstreaminfection in humans. To benchmark the single cell spectra obtained by O-PTIRspectroscopy, infrared signatures were also collected from bulk samples via both FTIR and O-PTIR spectroscopies. Our findings showed significant similarity andhigh reproducibility in the infrared signatures obtained by all three approaches,including similar discrimination patterns when subjected to clusteringalgorithms. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that O-PTIR and Raman data acquired simultaneously from bulk bacterial isolates displayed differentclustering patterns due to the ability of both methods to probe metabolitesproduced by bacteria. By contrast, signatures of microbial pigments wereidentified in Raman spectra, providing complementary and orthogonal informationcompared to infrared, which may be advantageous as it has been demonstrated that certain pigments play an important role in bacterial virulence. We found thatinfrared spectroscopy showed higher sensitivity than Raman for the analysis ofindividual cells. Despite the different patterns obtained by using Raman andinfrared spectral data as input for clustering algorithms, our findings showedhigh data reproducibility in both approaches as the biological replicates fromeach bacterial strain clustered together. Overall, we show that Raman andinfrared spectroscopy offer both advantages and disadvantages and, therefore,having both techniques combined in one single technology is a powerful tool with promising applications in clinical microbiology.

AB  - Rotational strip intercropping (RSI) of cereals and legumes has been developedand widely carried out to alleviate continuous cropping obstacles, to controlerosion and to improve field use efficiency. In this study, a four-yearfixed-field experiment was carried out in northeast China with three treatments: continuous cropping of maize, continuous cropping of peanuts and rotational stripintercropping of maize and peanut. The results show that crop rotation improvedthe main-stem height, branch number, lateral branch length, and yield and qualityof peanuts; the yield was the highest in 2018, when it was increased by 39.5%.RSI improved the contents of total N, available N, total P, available P, total K and available K; the content of available N was the highest in 2018, with anincrease of 70%. Rhizosphere soil urease and catalase activities weresignificantly increased and were the highest in 2017, reaching 183.13% and91.21%, respectively. According to a high-throughput sequencing analysis, therhizosphere soil bacterial richness and specific OTUs decreased in peanutrhizosphere soil, while the fungal increased. There were differences in thebacterial and fungal community structures; specifically, the abundance ofAcidobacteria and Planctomycetes increased among bacteria and the abundance ofbeneficial microorganisms such as Ascomycota increased among fungi. Inconclusion, rotational strip intercropping of maize and peanut increased theyield and quality of peanuts and conducive to alleviating the obstacles facingthe continuous cropping of peanuts. Among then, soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activity and microbial diversity were significantly affected the yield of peanut.

TI  - Role of Probiotics in the Management of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - e26463
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26463 [doi]
AB  - The global prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is estimated to bearound 4.4 billion, with the majority of individuals affected in developingcountries. Chronic infection of the gram-negative bacterium results in severalgastrointestinal pathologies such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and cancer.Probiotics compete directly with H. pylori and help restore the gut microbialenvironment; these living microorganisms are comparatively more effective thanthe standard triple antibiotic regimen in the management of symptoms related tothe pathogenic bacteria. The need for alternative therapy is better explained by the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance and the lowering of patientcompliance to the standard treatment. Adjuvant administration of probiotics to H.pylori eradication therapy is associated with a higher H. pylori eradicationrate, decreased diarrhea-related treatment, less common self-reported sideeffects, and higher treatment compliance. Therefore, with the ongoing and future resistance to antibiotics, this systematic review aims to investigate the use andefficacy of probiotics when used alone or in conjunction with the currentguideline treatment. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, MEDLINE, andCochrane for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2016 and April2022. MeSH terms used were: "H. pylori," "H. pylori and probiotics,""Probiotics," "H. pylori treatment," "Mechanism of Action" with subheadings as"clinical manifestations," "treatment," and "diagnosis." All literature reviews, original papers, and case reports were included. This search strategy aimed tofind literature that could describe the transmission and mechanism of action ofH. pylori, the current treatment guidelines, and the efficacy of probiotics ineradicating H. pylori.

AB  - Laver (Porphya sp.) containing vitamins and minerals has a high total number ofbacteria of 6-7 log CFU/g. Changes in microbial count in dried laver by lightpulse, ultrahigh pressure, electron beam, and superheated steam treatment werecompared. It was decreased by 1.3-1.7 log using IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) for30-60 s at an irradiation distance of 80 mm in dried and wet laver. The keyparameters of IPL are energy intensity, processing time and irradiation distance.Light pulse inactivation is based on destruction of microbial DNA structure.Electron beam irradiation at 7 and 10 kGy resulted reduction of 1.8-3.2 logCFU/g. Dried laver was treated at 500 MPa of ultra-high pressure for 3 min, totalbacterial number showed no change. Applying superheated steam at 150 degrees Cfor 10 s, about 3.3 log CFU/g sterilized. However, it is difficult to apply dueto severe damage to sensory quality such as browning.

TI  - The AAV-PCSK9 murine model of atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction.
PG  - oeac028
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac028 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Mouse models with genetic modifications are required to investigateatherogenesis and associated metabolic syndrome. Adeno-associated virus-8(AAV8)-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 (AAV8-PCSK9) induces hyperlipidaemia and promotes atherosclerosis in C57BL/6 mice. We aimed to assess whetherAAV8-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice fed high-fat diet with added cholesterol (HFD-C)would serve as a model of combined metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice received i.v. injection of AAV-PCSK9 and sex-and age-matched Ldlr(-/-) and C57BL/6 control mice were placed on HFD-C or chowdiet for 20 weeks (B6-PCSK9-HFD-C, Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C, B6-HFD-C, and B6-Chow,respectively). High-fat diet with added cholesterol feeding led to insulinresistance and impaired glucose clearance in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice compared withB6-Chow controls. This decrease in metabolic health in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice aswell as the development of atherosclerosis was similar to Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C mice.Importantly, HFD-C feeding induced pancreatic islet hyperplasia in B6-PCSK9-HFD-Cand B6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. In line with alterations in themetabolic phenotype, there was an increase in the number of pro-inflammatoryLy6C(high/med) monocytes within the adipose tissues of B6-PCSK9-HFD-C andB6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. Conclusion: High-fat diet with addedcholesterol-fed AAV-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice can serve as a useful model ofintegrated metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis that does not require geneticmanipulations.

TI  - Ameliorative effect of Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai on benign prostatichyperplasia in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 419-434
LID - 10.4162/nrp.2022.16.4.419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most commonprostate disease and one of the most common chronic diseases caused by aging inmen. On the other hand, there has been no research on BPH using Abeliophyllumdistichum Nakai (A. distichum). Therefore, this study investigated the effects ofA. distichum on BPH. MATERIALS/METHODS: A. distichum leaves were extracted withdistilled water, 70% ethanol, and 95% hexane as solvents. Subsequently, theinhibitory effects of each A. distichum extract on androgen receptor (AR)signaling were evaluated in vitro. The testosterone-induced BPH model was thenused to confirm the efficacy of A. distichum leaves in 70% ethanol extract(ADLE). RESULTS: ADLE had the strongest inhibitory effect on AR signaling. Acomparison of the activity of ADLE by harvest time showed that the leaves of A.distichum harvested in autumn had a superior inhibitory effect on AR signaling tothose harvested at other times. In the BPH rat model, the administration of ADLE reduced the prostate size and prostate epithelial cell thickness significantlyand inhibited AR signaling. Subsequently, the administration of ADLE also reducedthe expression of growth factors, thereby inactivating the PI3K/AKT pathway.CONCLUSIONS: An analysis of the efficacy of ADLE to relieve BPH showed that theethanol extract grown in autumn exhibited the highest inhibitory ability of theandrogen-signaling related factors in vitro. ADLE also inhibited the expressionof growth factors by inhibiting the expression of the androgen-signaling related factors in vivo. Overall, ADLE is proposed as a functional food that is effectivein preventing BPH.

TI  - Determinants of sexual function among survivors of gynaecological cancers in atertiary hospital: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1384
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1384 [doi]
AB  - Background: Gynaecological cancer impacts approximately three million womenglobally. The problem is much more intense in resource-limited countries. Sexual health is a critical aspect of gynaecological cancer treatment and an importantcomponent of quality of life (QoL). Aims: This study aimed to assess thedeterminants of sexual function among survivors of gynaecological cancer. Method:This was a cross-sectional study. The simple random sampling technique was usedto recruit survivors of gynaecological cancers aged 18 years and above onfollow-up in a tertiary hospital in Kenya. Tools: The study used thesocio-demographic survey, Body Image Scale, Multidimensional Perceived SocialSupport Scale and Female Sexual Function Index. Results: Cervical cancer was the most common gynaecological malignancy among respondents (51%). The mean totalscore of the Female Sexual Function Index was significantly low at 10.0 (cut off = 26.5). The majority (85%) of respondents had sexual dysfunction. The mostcommonly affected sexual domain was lubrication at a mean value of 0.91 (SD =1.58). Age (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.003-0.16, p = 0.005), cancer stage 3 (aOR =9.81, 95% CI: 1.34-20.56, p = 0.035) and social support (aOR = 1.29, 95% CI:1.05-1.59, p = 0.015) were independent predictors of sexual dysfunction.Conclusion: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction among gynaecological cancersurvivors remains significantly high. Having cervical cancer was the mostsignificant predictor of sexual dysfunction in this study population.Recommendation: There is a need for further studies to improve the sexual lifeand hence the QoL among survivors of gynaecological malignancies.
