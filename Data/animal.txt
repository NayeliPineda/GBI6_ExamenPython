AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder of unknownetiology that occurs in women of reproductive age. Despite being considered toaffect up to one-fifth of women in this cohort, the condition lacks generallyaccepted diagnostic biomarkers and options for targeted therapy. Hereby, weanalyzed the diagnostic, therapeutic, and functional potential of a recentlydiscovered miR-335-5p that was observed to be reduced in the follicular fluid(FF) of PCOS patients as compared with healthy women. We found miR-335-5p to besignificantly decreased in the serum and FF samples of PCOS patients (n=40) vs.healthy women (n=30), as well as in primary human granulosa cells (hGCs), and in 3 different hormonally induced PCOS-like murine models vs. wild-type (WT) mice.The level of circulating miR-335-5p was found to significantly correlate with theimpaired endocrine and clinical features associated with PCOS in human patients. Ovarian intrabursal injection of the miR-335-5p antagomir in WT mice ovariesinduced a PCOS-like reproductive phenotype. Treatment with the miR-335-5p agomir rescued the dihydrotestosterone-induced PCOS-phenotype in mice, thereby providinga functional link between miR-335-5p and PCOS. We identified SP1 as a miR-335-5p target gene by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Both the luciferasereporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that SP1 bound tothe promoter region of human CYP19A1 and inhibited its transcription. miR-335-5p increased the production of estradiol via the SP1/CYP19A1 axis in hGCs, therebysuggesting its mechanistic pathway of action. In conclusion, these resultsprovide evidence that miR-335-5p may function as a mediator in theetiopathogenesis of PCOS, as well as has the potential as both a novel diagnosticbiomarker and therapeutic target for PCOS.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination and low use efficiency of phosphorus (P) fertilizersare worldwide issues. Alkaline lignin is expected to decrease the heavy metalrisk and enhance the P availability in heavy-metal-contaminated soils. A 120-day incubation study examined the effects of alkaline lignin on Cd, Pb and Pbioavailability and transformation in Cd or Cd/Pb co-contaminated red andcinnamon soils and elucidated the associated mechanisms. A pot experiment furthertested Cd accumulation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in theCd-contaminated red soil. The amendment of alkaline lignin increased theconcentrations of bioavailable Cd by 13-20% in the acid red soil and 97-107% inthe alkaline cinnamon soil, respectively, being due to the increase of dissolved organic C concentrations. Meanwhile, it also increased the concentrations ofavailable P in both soils, Al-P in red soil and Ca2-P in cinnamon soil.Consequently, alkaline lignin amendment increased lettuce biomass by 8-23% inshoots and by 56-71% in roots, P uptake by 37-50% in shoots and by 28-62% inroots, and limited Cd transport from root to shoot which decreased Cdconcentrations by 26% in lettuce shoot (edible part). The results suggest thatalkaline lignin increases plant growth and decreases Cd bioaccumulation in theshoot through restricting Cd translocation from the root to shoot and increasing soil P availability but not Cd immobilization, and hence may have potential toreduce vegetable Cd contamination risk.

AB  - PURPOSE: In vivo optical imaging systems are essential for tracking diseaseprogression and evaluating therapeutic efficacy in animal studies. However,current approaches are limited by the inability to accurately capture 3D imageinformation. To overcome this hindrance, we adopted x-ray computed tomography(CT) as a prior for 3D optical image reconstruction and further challenged themultimodal imaging performance with a metastasis model. METHODS AND MATERIALS:The XXX system, an integrated small animal research platform, featuresco-registered high quality quantitative optical tomography and CT. In thesynergistic dual-modality imaging, CT provides both 3D anatomy information andanimal structure mesh for optical tomography reconstruction which is performedusing bioluminescence projections acquired from 4 orthogonal angles. Themultimodal imaging system was challenged with a prostate cancer metastasis model and a double-blind histopathology diagnosis was performed to validate the imagingresults. RESULTS: The XXX located, visualized and quantified early tumormetastases at millimeter scale, and can accurately track deep tumors as small as 1.5 mm in live animals. Tumors metastasized into the liver, diaphragm, and tibia in four mice were all successfully diagnosed by the integrated tomographicimaging. CONCLUSION: Instead of roughly comparing surface light intensities astraditionally performed in 2D optical imaging, with integrated CT and opticaltomography, XXX provides accurate tumor imaging and quantitative assessmentcapabilities for cancer metastasis research. With the powerful 3D optical/CTimaging capability, XXX has the potential to tackle more complex research needswith higher targeting accuracy.

AB  - The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) plays important roles in fishreproduction. To understand the role of IGF1 in steroidogenesis and oocytematuration, we investigated expression pattern and functions of Igf1 during invitro maturation of spotted steed (Hemibarbus maculatus) oocytes. Igf1 expressionquantified by qPCR and western blotting revealed that both Igf1 mRNA and protein was significantly increased in mature follicles. The immunofluorescence analyses showed IGF1 protein signal was detected in the theca cells of ovarian folliclesduring vitellogenesis stage, and in both theca cells and granulosa cells ofmatured oocytes. Incubation of ovarian follicles with recombinant IGF1 (rIGF1)significantly enhanced the rate of spotted steed oocyte germinal vesiclebreakdown (GVBD), a marker of oocyte maturation. qPCR analysis showed that thetranscription of steroidogenesis-related genes (3beta-hsd, 20beta-hsd, Cyp17a andCyp19a1a) were influenced after IGF1 treatment. In addition, the expressionprofiles of receptors of Igf1, Fsh and Lh indicated that a cross talk response toIGF1 induced oocyte maturation. Furthermore, IGF1 treatment did not affect ERKprotein expression but significantly upregulated CyclinB and AKT proteinexpression. All together, these findings help us to understand the molecularmechanism of IGF1 in regulation ovarian steroidogenesis and oocyte maturation of spotted steed.

AB  - In the domain of human neuroimaging, much attention has been paid to the questionof whether and how the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) has advanced our scientific knowledge of the human brain. However, theopposite question is also important; how has our knowledge of the visual systemadvanced our understanding of fMRI? Here, we discuss how and why scientificknowledge about the human and animal visual system has been used to answerfundamental questions about fMRI as a brain measurement tool and how theseanswers have contributed to scientific discoveries beyond vision science.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiang-lian pill, consisting of Coptis chinensisFranch. coprocessed with Tetradium ruticarpum (A.Juss.) T.G.Hartley(Yu-huang-lian) and Aucklandia lappa DC. (Mu-xiang), is traditionally used torelieve fever, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal inflammatory symptomsobserved in patients with malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. Each of thethree herbs contained in Xiang-lian pill has been indicated to have anticancereffects on a variety of cancers, but its effects on pancreatic cancer remainunexplored. The main extracts of these herbs have anti-pancreatic cancer effects,but the comprehensive mechanism of this compound prescription of Xiang-lian pill in pancreatic cancer remains to be revealed. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore themain active ingredients, potential anti-pancreatic cancer targets, and relatedmechanisms of the Xiang-lian pill and to determine its therapeutic value in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis wereapplied to screen the potential effective ingredients and key targets.Liquid/gas-mass spectrometry was performed for ingredients validation. Molecular docking and the cellular thermal shift assay were performed to test the bindingefficiency between ingredients and targets. A murine pancreatic cancer model was established and administered different doses of the Xiang-lian pill.Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for histopathological observation.Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were conducted for target validation. In vitro studies (cell viability and clonogenicity assays) were conducted toinvestigate the impact of three main ingredients in Xiang-lian pill on pancreaticcancer cells. PTGS2 overexpression was performed to reversely confirm theantitumor mechanisms of rutaecarpine as a specific PTGS2 inhibitor. RESULTS:Results showed that the Xiang-lian pill suppressed pancreatic cancer growth with a 1.56g/kg dose with no significant toxicity. Sixteen potentially activeingredients and 26 corresponding therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer wereidentified. PTGS2, PTGS1, KCNH2, PRSS1, and HSP90AA1 were the top 5 significantgenes targeted by the Xiang-lian pill. Evodiamine, rutaecarpine and stigmasterol bound to PTGS2 and PTGS1 with different affinities and inhibited pancreaticcancer cell proliferation. The PTGS2-associated metabolic pathway MEK/ERK wasdownregulated by rutaecarpine in vitro and the Xiang-lian pill in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Xiang-lian pill mainly regulates inflammation, apoptosis,metastasis, and metabolism to exert an antitumor effect. The main activeingredients in Xiang-lian pill exhibit antitumor roles through directly bindingto key targets in pancreatic cancer. PTGS2 mediated MEK/ERK inhibition byrutaecarpine represents a key therapeutic mechanism of Xiang-lian pill.

AB  - Since the introduction of the cancer stem cell (CSC) paradigm, significantadvances have been made in understanding the functional and biological plasticityof these elusive components in malignancies. Endowed with self-renewing abilitiesand multilineage differentiation potential, CSCs have emerged as cellular driversof virtually all facets of tumor biology, including metastasis, tumorrecurrence/relapse, and drug resistance. The functional and biologicalcharacteristics of CSCs, such as self-renewal, cell fate decisions, survival,proliferation, and differentiation are regulated by an array of extracellularfactors, signaling pathways, and pluripotent transcriptional factors. Besides thewell-characterized regulatory role of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG,KLF4, and MYC in CSCs, evidence for the central role of Forkhead boxtranscription factor FOXM1 in the establishment, maintenance, and functions ofCSCs is accumulating. Conventionally identified as a master regulator of the cellcycle, a comprehensive understanding of this molecule has revealed itsmultifarious oncogenic potential and uncovered its role in angiogenesis,invasion, migration, self-renewal, and drug resistance. This review compiles the large body of literature that has accumulated in recent years that providesevidence for the mechanisms by which FOXM1 expression promotes stemness inglioblastoma, breast, colon, ovarian, lung, hepatic, and pancreatic carcinomas.We have compiled the data showing the association of stem cell mediators withFOXM1 using TCGA mRNA expression data. Further, the prognostic importance ofFOXM1 and other stem cell markers is presented. The delineation of FOXM1-mediatedregulation of CSCs can aid in the development of molecularly targetedpharmacological approaches directed at the selective eradication of CSCs inseveral human malignancies.

AB  - Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common micronutrient deficiency. Tegillarcagranosa (T. granosa) is a good source of iron due to its high content ofhemoglobin. The present study aimed to determine the effects of glycosylation on structure, physicochemical characteristics and iron bioavailability ofhemoglobin. Using Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology, theoptimal conditions for hemoglobin-chitosan glycosylation were obtained: 61.8degrees C, pH6.3, hemoglobin/chitosan mass ratio of 4.3 and reaction time of15min. The formation of hemoglobin-chitosan conjugates was verified by SDS-PAGEand fluorescence spectroscopy. The surface hydrophobicity of hemoglobin wasreduced by 20.90-65.05% after glycosylation, along with the observations ofelevated water-holding capacity, likely owing to the introduction of hydrophilic groups. Antioxidant capacity of glycosylated products (0.41-0.66muM Trolox/mgprotein) was markedly greater than that of original protein (0.06muM Trolox/mgprotein) due to the formation of brown polymers with antioxidant activity. Inaddition, glycosylation improved in vitro digestibility of hemoglobin by41.15-69.09%, which could be attributed to less beta-sheet in secondarystructures. Moreover, hemoglobin (324.38ng/mg) exhibited better iron absorptionthan FeSO4 (121.63ng/mg), with the value being further enhanced by glycosylation (442.73ng/mg), which may be due to the improved protein digestibility andiron-chelating capacity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium chauvoei is a gram-positive, spore-forming, strictlyanaerobic bacterium that causes blackleg, a disease that affects cattle byinducing fulminant myonecrosis, thereby leading to high and constant losses ofcattle. Macrophages (Ms) are depleted in tissues infected with the vegetativeform of C. chauvoei, but the mechanism remains partially known. Consequently, Ms may be a critical target in the pathogenicity of C. chauvoei. AIM: The objective of this work was to study the mechanism of death of mouse-primary Ms infected in vitro for 24h with the vegetative form of C. chauvoei. METHODS: Mouse peritoneal Ms were infected in vitro with different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of C.chauvoei (i.e., 5:1, 20:1, and 100:1). After 24h post-infection, cell viability(MTT reduction assay), apoptosis (apoptotic bodies, DNA ladder, and Annexin Vassays), and inflammatory cell response (iNOS and TNF-alpha expression) wereassessed. RESULTS: All the MOIs investigated decreased cell viability. An MOI of 20:1 caused the highest production of apoptotic bodies and an electrophoreticDNA-ladder pattern typical of an apoptosis cell death process. These results werecorroborated using the Annexin V-flow cytometry assay. Concurrently withapoptotic cell death, Mvarphis expressed iNOS and TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION:Inflammation-mediated apoptosis of Mvarphis can be a potential mechanism ofevasion of the immune response used by C. chauvoei in tissues for depletingphagocytic cells at the site of infection.

AB  - Regenerative involution is important for the subsequent lactation, but molecular mechanism has not been revealed. The crucial miRNA in tissue developmentindicates that miRNAs might participate in regenerative involution. In thepresent study, the mammary tissues of the dairy goats (n=3) were collected viabiopsy at wk-8 (time to dry off), -6, -4, -1, and +1 relative to lambing for the Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and miRNA sequencing. Alveolar structurescollapsed during regenerative involution, but the structures remained intact and distended. Among the 50 miRNA expression trajectories categorized by shorttime-series expression miner, two significant patterns were clustered. Thedifferentially expressed miRNAs in the two patterns were mainly related to theself-renewal of tissue and enriched in pathways containing vesical-mediatedtransport, tissue development, tube development, vasculature development andepithelial development. The identification of the miRNA will help in elucidating the regulatory roles of miRNAs in mammary gland development.

AB  - Throughout human life, an extensive and varied range of emerging environmentalcontaminants, called endocrine disruptors (EDCs), cause adverse health effects,including in the cardiovascular (CV) system. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) areworryingly one of the leading causes of all mortality and mobility worldwide. TheUV-B filter octylmethoxycinnamate (also designated octinoxate, or ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate (CAS number: 5466-77-3)) is an EDC widely present in allpersonal care products. However, to date, there are no studies evaluating theOMC-induced effects on vasculature using animal models to improve humancardiovascular health. This work analysed the effects of OMC on rat aortavasculature and explored the modes of action implicated in these effects. Ourresults indicated that OMC relaxes the rat aorta by endothelium-dependentmechanisms through the signaling pathways of cyclic nucleotides and byendothelium-independent mechanisms involving inhibition of L-Typevoltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (L-Type VOCC). Overall, OMC toxicity on rataorta may produce hypotension via vasodilation due to excessive NO release andblockade of L-Type VOCC. Moreover, the OMC-induced endothelial dysfunction mayalso occur by promoting the endothelial release of endothelin-1. Therefore, ourfindings demonstrate that exposure to OMC alters the reactivity of the rat aorta and highlight that long-term OMC exposure may increase the risk of human CVdiseases.

AB  - mPGES-1 is found to be up-regulated in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantianigra pars compacta (SNpc) of postmortem brain tissue from Parkinson's disease(PD) patients and neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mice. Sincethe genetic deletion of mPGES-1 abolished 6-OHDA-induced PGE2 production and6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo models,mPGES-1 enzyme has the potential to be an important target for PD therapy. In thepresent work, we investigated whether a small organic molecule as mPGES-1inhibitor could exhibit the neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-inducedneurotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo models. For this research goal, a newseries of arylsulfonyl hydrazide derivatives was prepared and investigatedwhether these compounds may protect neurons against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Among them, compound 7s (MPO-0144) as amPGES-1 inhibitor (PGE2 IC50 = 41.77 nM; mPGES-1 IC50 = 1.16 nM) exhibited apotent neuroprotection (ED50 = 3.0 nM) against 6-OHDA-induced in PC12 cellswithout its own neurotoxicity (IC50 = >10 muM). In a 6-OHDA-induced mouse modelof PD, administration of compound 7s (1 mg/kg/day, for 7days, i.p.) amelioratedmotor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal damage. These significant biological effects of compound 7s provided the first pharmacological evidence that mPGES-1inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic agent for PD patients.

AB  - The surveillance of migratory wild birds (MWBs) for avian influenza virus (AIV)allows detecting the emergence of highly pathogenic AIV that can infect domestic poultry and mammals, new subtypes, and antigenic/genetic variants. The currentAIV surveillance system for MWBs in the United States is based on virus isolation(VI) followed by sequencing isolates. This system primarily focuses on the early detection of H5 and H7 AIVs. However, it is suboptimal in assessing diverse AIVsubtypes at any given time because of the low VI success rate. To improve such a shortfall, a SYBR(R) Green-based real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction (rtRT-PCR) panel was developed for direct HA subtyping of AIVs inoropharyngeal-cloacal (OPC) swabs from MWBs. Under optimal conditions, the PCRpanel detected AIVs of all 16 different HA subtypes with an average limit ofdetection of 10(2.6) copies/reaction (2mul of extract). In testing 90 OPC swabsfrom 13 MWB species, the PCR provided a significantly faster turnaround ofresults and demonstrated the presence of more subtypes and concurrent infectionamong MWBs compared to what the current surveillance testing algorithm showed. Inconclusion, newly developed SYBR(R) Green rtRT-PCR panel can be a useful tool formonitoring MWBs for AIVs.

AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virusbelonging to the Flaviviridae family. The JEV is the leading cause of viralencephalitis in children and the elderly which is spread by mosquitoes. JEVinfection has been established in different animal models such as mouse, hamster,guinea pig, swine, rat, monkey, rabbit by using the different routes ofinoculations. Here, we have shown that the alpha/beta and gamma -receptordeficient AG129 mouse induces fatal encephalitis in both young and aged old mice,when challenged with high titer JEV Indian clinical isolate by both peritonealand intradermal route. The JEV infected AG129 mouse have shown neurologicalsymptoms, JEV-induced pathological features and supported high level viralreplication. Additionally, administration of JEV in AG129 mice resulted in theinduction of severe peripheral vascular permeability, which is a major hall mark of Dengue infection but not shown in JEV. Taken together, our results demonstrateinterferon alpha/beta and gamma receptors knock out AG129 mouse does not needadaptation of JEV clinical isolates and could be is a promising JEV challengemouse model by mimicking the natural intradermal route of administration forrapid screening of novel antivirals and vaccines.

AB  - The host response to virus infection is mediated by the interferon system and itsworkhorse effector proteins like Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Viperin isan interferon-inducible antiviral protein. In the present study, an antiviralradical SAM enzyme, viperin homologue, was cloned and characterised from teleost,Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). This cloned viperin cDNA encodes 351 amino acidprotein with predicted N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix, conserved radicalS-adenosyl l-methionine (SAM) domain with CxxxCxxC motif and a highly conservedC-terminal domain. Lcviperin gene consists of six exons and five introns. Thesecondary structure contains nine alpha helices and beta sheets. Viperin fromLates is evolutionarily conserved and shares about 89% identity with Serioladumerili and 70% identity with human orthologue. Poly(I:C) and RGNNV upregulated Lcviperin during in-vivo challenge studies, providing insight into its antiviral properties. Lates antiviral effector genes like viperin could help in elucidatingthe host-virus protein interactions and allow the development of improvedantiviral strategies against pathogens like betanodavirus that devastateaquaculture of the species.

AB  - Stress-induced psychiatric symptoms, such as increased anxiety, decreasedsociality, and depression, differ considerably across individuals. The cognitive model of depression proposes that biased negative memory is a crucial determinantin the development of mental stress-induced disorders. Accumulating evidence fromboth clinical and animal studies has demonstrated that such biased memoryprocessing could be triggered by the hippocampus, a region well known to beinvolved in declarative memories. This review mainly describes how memory-relatedneurophysiological mechanisms in the hippocampus and their interactions withother related brain regions are involved in the regulation of stresssusceptibility and discusses potential interventions to prevent and treatstress-related psychiatric symptoms. Further neurophysiological insights based onmemory mechanisms are expected to devise personalized prevention and therapy toconfer stress resilience.

AB  - Species and populations with greater cognitive performance are more successful atadapting to changing habitats. Accordingly, urban species and populations oftenoutperform their rural counterparts on problem-solving tests. Paradoxically,urban foraging also might be detrimental to the development and integrity ofanimals' brains because anthropogenic foods often lack essential nutrients suchas the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) anddocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are important for cognitive performance inmammals and possibly birds. We tested whether urbanization or consumption of EPA and DHA are associated with problem-solving abilities in ring-billed gulls, aseabird that historically exploited marine environments rich in omega-3 fattyacids but now also thrives in urban centres. Using incubating adults nestingacross a range of rural to urban colonies with equal access to the ocean, wetested whether urban gulls preferentially consumed anthropogenic food while ruralnesters relied on marine organisms. As we expected individual variation inforaging habits within nesting location, we characterized each captured gulls'diet using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses of their red blood cells. Totest their problem-solving abilities, we presented the sampled birds with ahorizontal rendition of the string-pull test, a foraging puzzle often used inanimal cognitive studies. The isotopic and fatty acid profiles of urban nestersindicated a diet comprising primarily anthropogenic food, whereas the profiles ofrural nesters indicated a high reliance on marine organisms. Despite the gulls'degree of access to urban foraging habitat not predicting solving success, birds with biochemical profiles reflecting anthropogenic food (less DHA and a highercarbon-13 ratio in their red blood cells) had a greater probability of solvingthe string-pull test. These results suggest that experience foraging onanthropogenic food is the main explanatory factor leading to successfulproblem-solving, while regular consumption of omega-3s during incubation appears inconsequential.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a widely distributed endocrine disruptor and has been reported tobe closely correlated to the pathogenesis of diabetes. Since pancreaticbeta-cells loss and dysfunction are central to pathogenesis of diabetes, studyingCd toxicity on pancreatic beta-cells and its molecular mechanism is an important scientific issue. However, less attention has been payed to study how Cd induces pancreatic beta-cells death and dysfunction in recent years. Thus, our study aimsto explore the toxic mechanism of Cd treatment on pancreatic beta-cells usingboth cellular and animal models. Firstly, it was confirmed that Cd induceddecreased cell viability and insulin secretion in a dose-and time-dependentmanner in MIN6 cells. To explore the underlying mechanism, transcriptomicanalysis was employed to screen the differentially expressed genes and disturbed metabolic pathways. Go and KEGG analysis showed that Cd exposure triggeredferroptosis process in MIN6 cells. We further validated that Cd led to GSHdepletion, Gpx4 reduction, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potentialloss and ultrastructural damage at mitochondrial level. Since immune systemprocess was also perturbed based on GO analysis, we found that Cd activatedAger/Pkc/p65 inflammatory process. Moreover, ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 couldeffectively antagonized the activation of Ager-mediated immune process. It wasalso revealed that Cd induced iron accumulation as well as decreased Gpx4expression in mice islets. We also uncovered that Cd led to systemic andpancreatic inflammation as early as third week after Cd exposure.

AB  - It is at an early development stage the best opportunity for a society to learnthe concepts of sustainable production and consumption. Schools can serve aseffective and efficient ways for this purpose. This work quantifies the Nitrogen Footprint (NF) of twelve school menus developed following the Spanish dietaryguidelines. The analysis considers six fall school menus and six spring schoolmenus for 7 to 12years old children. Fall menus present higher NF than springmenus, being on average 23gN and 19gN, respectively. This is mainly due to thepresence of beef dishes in fall menus, which significantly increase theproduction NF. Menus including non-meat protein sources, such as legumes, exhibitthe lowest N pollution. Menus with beef dishes remain the most intensive menusfor fall and spring in terms of N pollution and energy intake, being 0.04gN/kcal.The highest contributing stage to the total NF is the production (92.6%),followed by consumption (5.8%), while the distribution and cooking stages presentlower contributions. In order to improve the overall NF, some reductionstrategies are: (1) substitution of beef with other animal meat sources, (2)substitution of beef with non-meat sources, (3) improvement of wastewatertreatment efficiency, and (4) recycling non-edible food. Substituting beef withnon-meat sources achieves the highest reduction (76%) compared to the total NF ofthe school menus. It is recommendable to include environmental aspects related toN emissions within the school guidelines in order to provide practicalinformation to policymakers and guide-users.

AB  - In our recently published study in Science of the Total Environment, we used asystematic literature search to investigate the current state of research ofpersistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (PBTs) and insects. We found adistinct increase of human, animal, and vertebrate publications related to PBTsin the early 1990s but did not identify a conclusive cause for this. In herLetter to the Editor, Huang (2022) offered an explanation for our result, and we have used her initiative to repeat our analysis with refined methodology. Wepresent a corrected version of our original Fig. 1; importantly, though, our mainfinding, the general underrepresentation of insects in the research of PBTs, has remained the same. We conclude by addressing difficulties such as thereproducibility in literature searches and by discussing consequences of unequal resource distributions in science.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an overlooked cause of morbidity, which was shownto accelerate inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal cell loss and isassociated with spatial learning and memory impairments and some psychiatricdisturbances in older adults. However, there is no effective treatment in orderto offer a favorable outcome encompassing a good recovery after TBI in olderadults. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the histological andneurobehavioral effects of Allopurinol (ALL) in older rats that received repeatedTBI (rTBI). For this purpose, a weight-drop rTBI model was used on old maleWistar rats. Rats received 5 repeated TBI/sham injuries 24h apart and weretreated with saline or Allopurinol 100mg/kg, i.p. each time. They were randomlyassigned to three groups: control group (no injury); rTBI group (received 5 rTBI and treated with saline); rTBI+ALL group (received 5 rTBI and treated withAllopurinol). Then, half of the animals from each group were sacrificed on day 6 and the remaining animals were assessed with Open field, Elevated plus maze andMorris Water Maze test. Basic neurological tasks were evaluated with neurologicalassessment protocol every other day until after the 19th day from the lastinjury. Brain sections were processed for neuronal cell count in the hippocampus (CA1), dentate gyrus (DG), and prefrontal cortex (PC). Also, animmunohistochemical assay was performed to determine NeuN, iNOS, and TNFalphalevels in the brain regions. The number of neurons was markedly reduced in CA1,GD, and PC in rats receiving saline compared to those receiving allopurinoltreatment. Immunohistochemical analysis showed marked induction of iNOS andTNFalpha expression in the brain tissues which were reduced after allopurinol at 6 and 19days post-injury. Also, ALL-treated rats demonstrated a remarkable inducein NeuN expression, indicating a reduction in rTBI-induced neuronal cell death.In neurobehavioral analyses, time spent in closed arms, in the corner of the openfield, swimming latency, and distance were impaired in injured rats; however, allof them were significantly improved by allopurinol therapy. To sum up, this studydemonstrated that ALL may mitigate rTBI-induced damage in aged rats, whichsuggests ALL as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of recurrentTBI.

AB  - Family with sequence similarity 83 A (FAM83A) is a newly discoveredproto-oncogene that has been shown to play key roles in various cancers. However,the function of FAM83A in other physiological processes is not well known. Here, we report a novel function of FAM83A in adipocyte differentiation. We used anadipocyte-targeting fusion-oligopeptide (FITC-ATS-9R) to deliver aFAM83A-sgRNA/Cas9 plasmid to knock down Fam83a (ATS/sg-FAM83A) in white adiposetissue (WAT) in mice, which resulted in reduced WAT mass, smaller adipocytes, andmitochondrial damage that was aggravated by a high-fat diet (HFD). In cultured3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found loss or knockdown of Fam83a significantly repressedlipid droplet formation and downregulated the expression of lipogenic genes andproteins. Furthermore, inhibition of Fam83a decreased mitochondrial ATPproduction through blockage of the electron transport chain, associated withenhanced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate FAM83A interacts with casein kinase 1 (CK1) and promots the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Furthermore, loss of Fam83a in adipocytes hampered the formation of the TOM40complex and impeded CK1-driven lipogenesis. Taken together, these resultsestablish FAM83A as a critical regulator of mitochondria maintenance duringadipogenesis.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of microbialinoculation and storage length on the fermentation profile and nutrientcomposition of high-moisture corn (HMC) ensiled at two different dry matter (DM) concentrations. High-moisture corn was harvested when kernel DM concentrationswere approaching 65% as-fed, and either left undried (HMC65; 67.6% DM) or driedat 40 degrees C to approximately 70% DM (HMC70; 71.0% DM), and then ensiled inquadruplicate vacuum pouches untreated (CON) or after one of the followinginoculant treatments: 6.36 x 10 5 cfu of Lentilactobacillus buchneri DSM 12856,Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DSM 12836, and Pediococcus acidilactici DSM 16243per g of HMC (LBLP); or 3.0 x 10 5 cfu of L. buchneri DSM 12856,Lentilactobacillus diolivorans DSM 32074, and P. acidilactici DSM 16243 per g of HMC (LBLD). Vacuum pouches were allowed to ferment for 7, 14, 28, or 56 d. Athree-way interaction was observed (P = 0.01) for the pH of HMC, where CON forHMC70 was greatest across storage lengths and HMC65 treatments generally had alower pH than other treatments. Concentrations of total acids were greater (P =0.001) in HMC65 than HMC70 and greater (P = 0.001) in HMC treated with LBLP andLBLD than CON. An interaction between DM concentration, microbial inoculation,and storage length was observed (P = 0.05) for concentrations of acetic acid. At 14 d, acetic acid concentrations were greater in HMC65 treated with LBLD thanother treatments. Likewise, at 56 d, concentrations of acetic acid were greatest in HMC65 treated with LBLD, followed by HMC70 treated with LBLD. An interactionbetween DM concentration, microbial inoculation, and storage length was observed (P = 0.05) for 7-h starch disappearance (starchD). Across all DM concentrationand inoculant treatment combinations, starchD increased with increasing storagelength. StarchD was also generally greater for HMC65 treatments compared toHMC70, with small differences among inoculants. Results suggest that microbialinoculation can improve fermentation of HMC by increasing the production ofantifungal acetic acid, but that DM concentration at ensiling remains a primarydeterminant of HMC fermentability.

AB  - Blastocyst complementation denotes a technique that aims to generate organs,tissues, or cell types in animal chimeras via injection of pluripotent stem cells(PSCs) into genetically compromised blastocyst-stage embryos. Here, we report on successful complementation of the male germline in adult chimeras followinginjection of mouse or rat PSCs into mouse blastocysts carrying a mutation inTsc22d3, an essential gene for spermatozoa production. Injection of mouse PSCsinto Tsc22d3-Knockout (KO) blastocysts gave rise to intraspecies chimerasexclusively embodying PSC-derived functional spermatozoa. In addition, injection of rat embryonic stem cells (rESCs) into Tsc22d3-KO embryos produced interspeciesmouse-rat chimeras solely harboring rat spermatids and spermatozoa capable offertilizing oocytes. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA sequencing, wedeconstructed rat spermatogenesis occurring in a mouse-rat chimera testis.Collectively, this study details a method for exclusive xenogeneic germ cellproduction in vivo, with implications that may extend to rat transgenesis, orendangered animal species conservation efforts.

TI  - Oscillations for active sensing in olfaction : bioinspiration from insectantennal movements.
LID - 10.1088/1748-3190/ac877a [doi]
AB  - Crustacean and insect antennal scanning movements have been postulated toincrease odorant capture but the exact mechanisms as well as measures ofefficiency are wanting. The aim of this work is to test the hypothesis that anincrease in oscillation frequency of a simplified insect antenna model translatesin an increase of odorant capture, and to quantify by how much and through which mechanism. We approximate the antennal movements of bumblebees, quantified in aprevious study, by a vertical oscillatory movement of a cylinder in a homogeneoushorizontal flow with odorants. We test our Multiphysics flow and mass transfernumerical model with dedicated experiments using Particle Image Velocimetry. Anew entire translating experimental measurement setup containing an oil tankenables us to work at appropriate Strouhal and Reynolds numbers. Increasingantennal oscillating frequency does increase the odorant capture rate, up to 200 %, proving this behavior being active sensing. This result holds however only up to a critical frequency. A decrease of efficiency characterizes higherfrequencies, due to molecules depletion within oversampled regions, themselvesdefined by overlaying boundary layers. Despite decades of work on thermal andmass transfer studies on oscillating cylinders, no analogy with published caseswas found. This is due to the unique flow regimes studied here, resulting fromthe combination of organ small size and low frequencies of oscillations. A theoryfor such flow regimes is thus to be developed, with applications to fundamentalresearch on animal perception up to bioinspired olfaction.

AB  - Levamisole (LEV) is a veterinary drug that often remains in animal food.Consuming products containing high levels of LEV will cause a series of harmfulreactions to human health. This work describes the Capture-SELEX(Capture-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) screeningstrategy of LEV aptamers, using streptavidin modified agarose beads as a solidphase medium to separate target-bound and unbound ssDNA. The affinity andspecificity of candidate aptamers were determined by SYBR Green I (SGI) dye andisothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), in which LEV-5 showed good bindingaffinity and specificity, and the dissociation constant was 66.15 +/- 11.86 nM.Circular dichroism (CD) was used to characterize aptamer conformational changesbefore and after target binding, including increased helicity and enhanced basestacking. To evaluate whether this aptamer can be used for LEV detection, acolorimetric-surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (colorimetric-SERS) dual-modeaptasensor was constructed based on the peroxidase-like activity and SERS effect of AuNPs/Cu-TCPP(Fe) nanosheets. The detection limits of this dual-modeaptasensor for LEV were 5 nM and 1.12 nM, respectively. This aptamer-based methodwas further successfully used to detect LEV in milk, with recoveries ranging from94.95% to 111.2%, providing a potential application for the detection of harmful substances in food.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To observe the changes in the bladder of fetal rats withmyelomeningocele (MMC) induced by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) during theembryonic development stages. METHODS: The fetal rat model of MMC was induced by intragastric administration of atRA to pregnant rats on embryonic day 10 (E10).Fetal rats were harvested at E16, E18, E20, and E21 for observation and furthertesting. Those with MMC were classified as the MMC group, while those without MMCas the RA group. The areas of MMC skin defect, the crown-rump length (CRL), andbody weight in different groups were compared. The histopathological changes inthe bladder were compared. The expression levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin(alphaSMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), connexin 43 (Cx43), desmin,beta3 tubulin, and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the bladderwere investigated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Pregnant rats given intragastric administration with olive oil (OIL group) at E10 were setas the blank control group. RESULTS: A total of 415 fetal rats of differentgestational ages were harvested with an MMC incidence of 56.05 % (139/248). Theincidence rate increased with embryonic days (p < 0.001). Compared with the othertwo control groups, the CRL and bodyweight of MMC fetal rats were significantlydelayed at E21 (p < 0.001). The expression levels of alphaSMA, SMMHC, Cx43,desmin, beta3 tubulin and VAChT in the bladder of MMC fetal rats weresignificantly decreased at E21 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In atRA-induced MMC fetalrats, there is neural, muscular, and stromal dysplasia in the bladder at an earlygestational age. Further investigations on neurogenic bladder secondary to MMCare applicable using this animal model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study explored the role of platelet TGF-beta1 from theperspective of inhibiting the excessive proliferation, migration and invasion of murine aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (MASMCs). METHOD: The platelets werefirst extracted from C57BL/6 mice, and the TGF-beta1 protein was obtained afterthe purification of protein. In vitro, the concentrations of angiotensin (Ang )and TGF-beta1 for intervention were screened by testing the viability of MASMCs, followed by the analysis concerning the effects of platelets, Ang and TGF-beta1on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and the expressions of pathway-relatedproteins in MASMCs. In vivo, an Ang -induced mouse model was established.TGF-beta1 was injected into the tail of mice as a therapeutic agent, and itsaction mechanism was further verified by the treatment of inhibitor SB505124. Theresults of the cell experiment were validated by evaluating the maximum diameter of abdominal aorta, the proportion of total weight, the changes of both pathologyand the expressions of pathway-related proteins in the mice. RESULT: 0.5 ng/mLAng and 15 ng/mL TGF-beta1 were chosen for treatment. The following results ofcell functional experiments and Western blot assay demonstrated that Ang promotedthe proliferation, migration and invasion of MASMCs via regulating relatedpathways, the effects of which were evidently reversed by TGF-beta1 andplatelets. Consistent results were also observed in the animal experiments, whereTGF-beta1 effectively alleviated Ang -induced abdominal aortic injury in mice.CONCLUSION: TGF-beta1 in platelets inhibits Ang -induced proliferation, migrationand invasion of MASMCs.

AB  - Since pig was successfully cloned in 2000, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)became a promising technique in preserving and expanding the genetics of superiorboars. Assessing the safety, growth performance, and reproductive performance of cloned pigs and their progeny is critical for their wide application. In thisstudy, three superior Duroc boars were used to construct 61,736 SCNT-clonedembryos. The semen quality and reproductive performance of the cloned Duroc pigs and the growth performances of their progeny were evaluated. Results showed that the cloned pigs derived from superior boars produced semen with normal qualityand exhibited similar reproductive performance as the donor boars, whoseprogenies showed greater growth performance than those derived from non-clonedpigs under the same feed condition. The results shed light on the application of cloning technology in the conservation and expansion of the genetic resources of Duroc pigs.

AB  - The use of data has been essential throughout the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. Wehave needed it to populate our models, inform our understanding, and shape ourresponses to the disease. However, data has not always been easy to find andaccess, it has varied in quality and coverage, been difficult to reuse orrepurpose. This paper reviews these and other challenges and recommends steps to develop a data ecosystem better able to deal with future pandemics by bettersupporting preparedness, prevention, detection and response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are metabolites of arachidonic acid that may impact atherosclerosis, and animal experimental studies suggest EETsprotect cardiac function. Plasma EETs are mostly esterified to phospholipids and part of an active pool. To address the limited information about EETs and CVD in humans, we conducted a prospective study of total plasma EETs (free + esterified)and diabetes-related CVD in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). METHODS: Wemeasured 4 EET species and their metabolites, dihydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), in plasma samples from 892 CHS participants with type 2 diabetes. Wedetermined the association of EETs and DHETs with incident myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke using Cox regression. FINDINGS: During follow-up (median7.5 years), we identified 150 MI and 134 ischemic strokes. In primary,multivariable analyses, elevated levels of each EET species were associated with non-significant lower risk of incident MI (for example, hazard ratio for 1 SDhigher 14,15-EET: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.72-1.02; p=0.08). The EETs-MI associationsbecame significant in analyses further adjusted for DHETs (hazard ratio for 1 SD higher 14,15-EET adjusted for 14,15-DHET: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.91; p=0.004).Elevated EET levels were associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke inprimary but not secondary analyses. Three DHET species were associated withhigher risk of ischemic stroke in all analyses. INTERPRETATION: Findings fromthis prospective study complement the extensive studies in animal models showing EETs protect cardiac function and provide new information in humans. Replication is needed to confirm the associations. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.

AB  - An elevated plasma level of soluble ST2 (sST2) is a risk biomarker forgraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and death in patients receiving hematopoieticcell transplantation (HCT). sST2 functions as a trap for IL-33 and amplifies the pro-inflammatory type 1 and 17 response while suppressing the tolerogenic type 2 and regulatory T cells activation during GVHD development. We previouslyidentified small-molecule ST2 inhibitors particularly iST2-1 that reduces plasma sST2 levels and improved survival in two animal models. Here, we reported thestructure-activity relationship of the furanylmethylpyrrolidine-based ST2inhibitors based on iST2-1. Based on the biochemical AlphaLISA assay, we improvedthe activity of iST2-1 by 6-fold ( approximately 6 muM in IC50 values) in theinhibition of ST2/IL-33 and confirmed the activities of the compounds in acellular reporter assay. To determine the inhibition of the alloreactivity invitro, we used the mixed lymphocyte reaction assay to demonstrate that our ST2inhibitors decreased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells proliferation and increased Tregpopulation. The data presented in this work are critical to the development ofST2 inhibitors in future.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% oflung cancer diagnoses across the world. Despite recent appreciable improvementsin treatment plans for patients with NSCLC, the prognosis for those with thecancer still remains poor. Recently, a growing number of studies have shown that N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs) may be critical in carcinogenesis, however, thefunctional and clinical significance of this pathway in NSCLC remains unclear andrequires further research. METHODS: Initially, we evaluated the expression levelsof NMT1 or NMT2 in a clinical cohort comprising of 303 paired primary NSCLCtissues and matched normal mucosae by using ELISA. We subsequently performed atissue microarray analysis (TMA) to confirm its expression pattern in anindependent validation cohort (n = 78). Then, we used a publicly available KMplotter database (n = 1921) to evaluate the prognostic impact of NMT1 and NMT2 inNSCLC. Lastly, a series of in-vitro molecular/cellular and animal experimentswere performed for mechanistic understanding of the role ofN-myristoyltransferases in NSCLC. RESULTS: Our ELISA data revealed that theexpression level of NMT1 and NMT2 was down-regulated in tumor tissues (n = 303, P< 0.0001), which was confirmed in an independent validation cohort by TMA (n =78, P = 0.014 for NMT1 and P < 0.0001 for NMT2). On the other hand, patients withlow expression of NMT1 or NMT2 had shorter overall survival (P = 0.013, HR = 0.85for NMT1; P = 0.00059, HR = 0.8, for NMT2). Mechanistically, we revealed that theinteraction and co-localization of NMT1 and NMT2 in NSCLC, and N-terminus of NMT1and NMT2 was observed to be crucial for their interaction as well as for theircatalytic activity. Moreover, we found that NMT1 can significantly promote theexpression of NMT2 by enhancing its stability. We corroborated these findings by performing functional assays in which the knockout of NMT1 and NMT2 resulted inenhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as increasedtumorxenograftgrowth. In addition, we identified miR-182 as a novel regulator of both NMT1 and NMT2. More specifically, the overexpression or inhibition ofmiR-182 modulated globe N-myristoylation level, contributed to phenotypicalterations in NSCLS cells. CONCLUSIONS: NMT1 and NMT2 can act as potential tumorsuppressors in NSCLC, and the inhibition of miR-182 expression or therapeuticNMTs replenishment may be a promising treatment option for patients with NSCLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To collect kinetic gait reference data of dogs of 2 breeds in theirgrowth period during walking and trotting gait, to describe their development,and to investigate the weight support pattern over time. ANIMALS: 8Foxhound-Boxer-Ingelheim Labrador Retriever mixed breeds and 4 Beagles.PROCEDURES: Ground reaction force variables (GRFs), peak vertical force andvertical impulse, and temporal variables (TVs) derived therefrom; time ofoccurrence; and stance times were collected. Body weight distribution (BWD) wasevaluated. Six measurements, each containing 1 trial in walking and 1 trial introtting gait, were taken at age 10, 17, 26, 34, 52, and 78 weeks. The studyperiod started July 17, 2013 and lasted until October 7, 2015. Area under thecurve with respect to increase was applied. The difference of area under thecurve with respect to increase values between breeds and gaits was analyzed usingeither the t test or the Mann-Whitney test. Generalized mixed linear models were applied. RESULTS: Significant differences in gait and breed comparisons werefound. Growing dogs showed a forelimb-dominated gait. The development of GRF and TV values over the study period were described. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Referencevalues for GRFs, TVs, and BWDs in growing dogs were given. A cranial shift inweight support over time was found during trotting gait. Smaller, younger dogswalked and trotted more inconsistently.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare biomechanical strength of 4.75- and 5.5-mm suture anchorswhen pulled at 45 degrees or 90 degrees angles using 1 versus 2 strands ofsuture. SAMPLE: 48 synthetic bone block samples. PROCEDURES: Anchors wereinserted into synthetic bone blocks and tested for pullout in 4 configurations (1suture strand vs 2 strands and 45 degrees vs 90 degrees insertion angle) for atotal of 8 groups with 6 samples each. A 3-way ANOVA was used to compare effectof anchor size, strand amount, and angle of pull. RESULTS: All constructs failed via anchor pullout. Anchor configurations with 2 strands of suture and 4.75-mmanchor (mean, 286 +/- 24 N) or 5.5-mm anchor (mean, 300 +/- 15 N) had greaterpullout strength than configurations with only 1 strand of suture and 4.75-mmanchor (mean, 202 +/- 12 N) or 5.5-mm anchor (mean, 286 +/- 13.6 N). The 5.5-mmanchors had a higher maximum load to failure under axial pull at 45 degrees(mean, 300 +/- 15 N) and 90 degrees (mean, 295 +/- 24 N), compared with 4.75-mmanchors at 45 degrees (mean, 202 +/- 12 N) and 90 degrees (mean, 208 +/- 15 N).There was a higher maximum load to failure for the double-stranded constructs,regardless of anchor size, at both angles of insertion. Anchors inserted at 45degrees had a higher maximum load to failure than those inserted at 90 degrees . Constructs with 2 strands of suture had a greater pullout strength regardless of the direction of pull. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The strength of the anchor constructis likely increased with the use of double-loaded anchors inserted at 45 degrees . Clinicians should consider using 2 strands in clinical cases.

LID - ajvr.21.07.0090 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the translation and angular rotation of the distalsesamoid bone (DSB) using computed tomography (CT) and medical modeling software.SAMPLE: 30 thoracic limbs from equine cadavers. PROCEDURES: Partial (n = 12),full (8), and matched full and subsequently transected (10) thoracic limbs werecollected. Bone volume CT images were acquired in three positions: extension (200degrees metacarpophalangeal angle), neutral (180 degrees ), and maximal flexion(110 degrees ). Mean translation and angular rotation of each DSB were recorded. Differences were determined with two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's tests forpairwise comparisons; P value was set at < 0.05. RESULTS: Dorsal translation was significant during extension (1.4 +/- 0.4 mm full limbs and 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmpartial limbs, P < 0.001). Distal translation was significant during extension(1.9 +/- 0.4 mm full and 1.1 +/- 0.4 mm partial) and flexion (5.4 +/- 0.7 mm fulland 6.22 +/- 0.6 mm partial, P < 0.001). Rotation was significant (P < 0.001)about the mediolateral axis during extension (17.1 degrees +/- 1.4 degrees ) and flexion (2.6 degrees +/- 1.3 degrees ). Translation and rotation of the DSB were significantly different (P < 0.001) between full and partial limbs. CLINICALRELEVANCE: This study provides the first quantification of translation andangular rotation of the DSB within the equine hoof. Partial limbs hadsignificantly reduced movement compared to full limbs, suggesting thattransection of flexor tendons alters distal thoracic limb kinematics. Furtherstudies are required to determine if pathologic changes in the podotrochlearapparatus have an impact in clinical lameness outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a qualitative analysis of the distribution of micro- andkappa-opioid receptor mRNA in the forebrain and midbrain of budgerigars(Melopsittacus undulatus). SAMPLE: 8 brains of male budgerigars. PROCEDURES:Custom-made RNA hybridization probes (RNAscope; Advanced Cell Diagnostics Inc)were used for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays performed onselected fresh frozen prepared sections of brain tissue to identify micro- andkappa-opioid receptor mRNA. RESULTS: There was kappa-opioid receptor mRNA presentin the nucleus dorsomedialis posterior thalami, lateral striatum, mesopallium,tractus corticohabenularis et corticoseptalis, griseum et fibrosum, stratumgriseum centrale, medial striatum, and area parahippocampalis. There wasmicro-opioid receptor mRNA present in the stratum griseum centrale, stratumopticum, dorsomedialis posterior thalami, area parahippocampalis, medialstriatum, and nidopallium intermedium. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Consistent withprevious studies in pigeons and domestic chicks, kappa-opioid receptors were moreabundant than micro-opioid receptors in the samples of the present study. Theresults of this study may also help explain the hyperexcitability or lack ofresponse that can occur with administration of pure micro-opioid receptoragonists, but not kappa-opioid receptor agonists. This study was notquantitative, so further research should endeavor to compare the various regions of the brain using FISH technology.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized bysocial disorder and stereotypical behaviors with an increasing incidence. ASDpatients are suffering from varying degrees of mental retardation and languagedevelopment abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasiveimaging technology to detect brain structural and functional dysfunction in vivo,playing an important role in the early diagnosisbasic research of ASD.High-field, small-animal MRI in basic research of autism model mice has provided a new approach to research the pathogenesis, characteristics, and interventionefficacy in autism. This article reviews MRI studies of mouse models of autismover the past 20 years. Reduced gray matter, abnormal connections of brainnetworks, and abnormal development of white matter fibers have been demonstrated in these studies, which are present in different proportions in the various mousemodels. This provides a more macroscopic view for subsequent research on autismmodel mice.

TI  - Microenvironmental sensing by fibroblasts controls macrophage population size.
PG  - e2205360119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2205360119 [doi]
AB  - Animal tissues comprise diverse cell types. However, the mechanisms controllingthe number of each cell type within tissue compartments remain poorly understood.Here, we report that different cell types utilize distinct strategies to control population numbers. Proliferation of fibroblasts, stromal cells important fortissue integrity, is limited by space availability. In contrast, proliferation ofmacrophages, innate immune cells involved in defense, repair, and homeostasis, isconstrained by growth factor availability. Examination of density-dependent gene expression in fibroblasts revealed that Hippo and TGF-beta target genes are both regulated by cell density. We found YAP1, the transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo signaling pathway, directly regulates expression of Csf1, thelineage-specific growth factor for macrophages, through an enhancer of Csf1 that is specifically active in fibroblasts. Activation of YAP1 in fibroblasts elevatesCsf1 expression and is sufficient to increase the number of macrophages at steadystate. Our data also suggest that expression programs in fibroblasts that change with density may result from sensing of mechanical force through actin-dependent mechanisms. Altogether, we demonstrate that two different modes of populationcontrol are connected and coordinated to regulate cell numbers of distinct celltypes. Sensing of the tissue environment may serve as a general strategy tocontrol tissue composition.

TI  - Melanin-concentrating hormone regulates the hypercapnic chemoreflex by acting in the lateral hypothalamic area.
LID - 10.1113/EP090318 [doi]
AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? MCH suppresses thehypercapnic chemoreflex but the mechanism by which this effect is produced hasnot been previously explored. What is the main finding and its importance? MCHacting in the lateral hypothalamic area but not in the locus coeruleus in rats,in the light period, attenuates the hypercapnic chemoreflex. Our data provide newinsight regarding the role of MCH in the modulation of the hypercapnicventilatory response. ABSTRACT: Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is ahypothalamic neuropeptide involved in a broad range of homeostatic functionsincluding regulation of the hypercapnic chemoreflex. We evaluated whether MCHmodulates the hypercapnic ventilatory response by acting in the lateralhypothalamic area (LHA) and/or in the locus coeruleus (LC). Here, we measuredpulmonary ventilation (VE ), body temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG) andelectromyogram (EMG) of unanesthetized adult male Wistar rats before and aftermicroinjection of MCH [0.4 mM] or MCH1-R antagonist (SNAP-94847 [63 mM]) into theLHA and LC, in room air and 7% CO2 conditions during wakefulness and sleep, inthe dark and light periods. MCH intra-LHA caused a decreased CO2 ventilatoryresponse during wakefulness and sleep in the light period, while SNAP-94847intra-LHA increased this response, during wakefulness in the light period. In theLC, MCH or the MCH1-R antagonist caused no change in the hypercapnic ventilatory response. Our results suggest that MCH, in the LHA, exerts an inhibitorymodulation of the hypercapnic ventilatory response during the light-inactiveperiod in rats. This article is protected by copyright.

However, due to its negative effects, thesearch for a new class of substances that can replace its efficacy has become oneof the urgent problems to be solved. Plant essential oils (EOs) as a natural feedadditive can maintain microbiota homeostasis and improve animal performance.However, its specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated.Therefore, we added different doses of essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum(EOZB) to the diets of Small Tail Han Sheep hybrid male lambs (STH lambs) toevaluate the effect of EOZB on rumen enzyme activity, rumen microbiology, and itsmetabolites in STH lambs. Twenty STH lambs were randomly divided into four groups(n = 5/group) and provided with the same diet. The dietary treatments were asfollows: basal diet (BD) group; BD+EOZB 5 ml/kg group; BD+EOZB 10 ml/kg group;BD+EOZB 15 ml/kg group. We found that EOZB 10 ml/kg helped to increase rumenpectinase (P<0.05) and lipase (P<0.05) activities. Microbial 16S rRNA geneanalysis showed that EOZB significantly altered the abundance of rumen microbiota(P<0.05). LC/GC-MS metabolomic analysis showed that the addition of EOZB produceda total of 1073 differential metabolites, with 58 differential metabolitesremaining after raising the screening criteria. These differential metaboliteswere mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, choline metabolism incancer, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, andprotein digestion and absorption. Correlation analysis showed that some rumenmicrobiota were significantly correlated with differential metabolite and enzyme activities.

AB  - In this study, we sequenced a bacteria isolate Pandoraea sp. 892iso isolated froma Phytophthora rubi strain which is an important plant pathogenic oomycete,identified through genome and combined the data with existing genomic data fromother 28 the genus of Pandoraea species. Next, we conducted a comparative genomicanalysis of the genome structure, evolutionary relationships, and pathogeniccharacteristics of Pandoraea species. Our results identified Pandoraea sp. 892isoas Pandoraea sputorum at both the genome and gene levels. At the genome level, wecarried out phylogenetic analysis of single-copy, gene co-linearity, ANI (averagenucleotide identity) and AAI (average amino acid identity) indices, rpoBsimilarity, MLSA phylogenetic analysis, and genome-to-genome distance calculator calculations to identify the relationship between Pandoraea sp. 892iso and P.sputorum. At the gene level, the quorum sensing genes ppnI and ppnR and theOXA-159 gene were assessed. It is speculated that Pandoraea sp. 892iso is theendosymbiont of the Oomycetes strain of Phytophthora rubi.

LID - 10.1111/jfd.13672 [doi]
AB  - Micropterus salmoides rhabdovirus (MSRV) is one of the common pathogens in thelargemouth bass industry, which can cause lethal diseases in juvenile fish andenormous economic losses. To establish effective means to prevent MSRV infection,the pcDNA3.1-G plasmid containing the MSRV glycoprotein gene was successfullyconstructed and intramuscularly injected into the largemouth bass to evaluate theimmune responses and protective effects in our study. As the results showed, the serum antibody levels of the fish vaccinated with different doses of pcDNA3.1-Gwere significantly higher compared with the control groups (PBS and pcDNA3.1).Meanwhile, the immune parameters (acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase) werealso significantly up-regulated. Several immune-related genes (IgM, IL-8,IL-12p40 and CD40) were expressed in the pcDNA3.1-G groups at higher levels than in the control groups, which indicated that strong immune responses were induced.Besides, the survival percentages of fish in the control groups (PBS andpcDNA3.1) and pcDNA3.1-G groups (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mug/fish) at 14 days afterchallenge experiment with MSRV were 0%, 0%, 6.1%, 15.2%, 29.0% and 48.5%respectively. This study indicated that pcDNA3.1-G was a prospective DNA vaccine candidate against MSRV-induced mortality.

TI  - State-of-the-art of ultrasound-triggered drug delivery from ultrasound-responsivedrug carriers.
LID - 10.1080/17425247.2022.2110585 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of new tools to locally and non-invasivelytransferring therapeutic substances at the desired site in deep living tissue hasbeen a long sought-after goal within the drug delivery field. Among theestablished methods, ultrasound (US) with US-responsive carriers holds greatpromise and demonstrates on-demand delivery of a variety of functional substanceswith spatial precision of several millimeters in deep-seated tissues in animalmodels and humans. These properties have motivated several explorations of USwith US responsive carriers as a modality for neuromodulation and the treatmentof various diseases, such as stroke and cancer. AREAS COVERED: This articlebriefly discussed three specific mechanisms that enhance in vivo drug deliveryvia US with US-responsive carriers: 1) permeabilizing cellular membrane, 2)increasing the permeability of vessels, and 3) promoting cellular endocytoticuptake. Besides, a series of US-responsive drug carriers are discussed, with anemphasis on the relation between structural feature and therapeutic outcome.EXPERT OPINION: This article summarized current development for each ofUS-responsive drug carrier, focusing on the routes of enhancing delivery andapplications. The mechanisms of interaction between US-responsive carriers and USenergy, such as cavitation, hyperthermia, and reactive oxygen species, as well ashow these interactions can improve drug delivery into target cell/tissue. It can be expected that there are serval efforts to further identification ofUS-responsive particles, design of novel US waveform sequence, and survey ofoptimal combination between US parameters and US-responsive carriers for bettercontrolling the spatiotemporal drug release profile, stability, and safety invivo. The authors believe these will provide novel tools for precisely designing treatment strategies and significantly benefit the clinical management of severaldiseases.

TI  - Graph Theory Analysis of Semantic Fluency in Russian-English Bilinguals.
LID - 10.1097/WNN.0000000000000312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Semantic category fluency is a widely used task involving language,memory, and executive function. Previous studies of bilingual semantic fluencyhave shown only small differences between languages. Graph theory analyzescomplex relationships in networks, including node and edge number, clusteringcoefficient, average path length, average number of direct neighbors, andscale-free and small-world properties. OBJECTIVE: To shed light on whether theunderlying neural processes involved in semantic category fluency testing yieldsubstantially different networks in different languages. METHOD: We comparedlanguages and methods using both network analysis and conventional analysis ofword production. We administered the animal naming task to 51 Russian-Englishbilinguals in each language. We constructed network graphs using three methods:(a) simple association of unique co-occurring neighbors, (b) correctedassociations between consecutive words occurring beyond chance, and (c) a networkcommunity approach using planar maximally filtered graphs. We compared theresultant network analytics as well as their scale-free and small-worldproperties. RESULTS: Participants produced more words in Russian than in English.Small-worldness metrics were variable between Russian and English but wereconsistent across the three graph theory analytical methods. CONCLUSION: Thenetworks had similar graph theory properties in both languages. The optimalmethodology for creating networks from semantic category fluency remains to bedetermined.

TI  - Outcomes of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicosis treated withtherapeutic plasma exchange in 62 dogs.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16507 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is gaining popularity for themanagement of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) overdose in dogs.HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Describe a population of dogs treated with TPE for NSAIDoverdose. ANIMALS: Sixty-two dogs with NSAID overdose treated with TPE. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study of dogs treated with TPE for ibuprofen,carprofen, or naproxen overdose. RESULTS: The median dose of ibuprofen, carprofenor naproxen ingested was 533 mg/kg (range, 36-4857 mg/kg), 217 mg/kg (range,88-625 mg/kg) and 138 mg/kg (range, 26-3000 mg/kg), respectively. Based onpreviously established toxic ranges for each NSAID, 2 (3.2%), 14 (22.6%), and 46 (74.2%) dogs ingested a gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological toxic dose,respectively. The median time between ingestion and presentation was 4 hours(range, 1-20 hours). The median number of plasma volumes processed was 1.6(range, 0.4-2.2). The median TPE session duration was 2 hours (range, 1-4.5hours). Circuit clotting developed during 8 (12.9%) sessions. Patient adverseevents reported during 21 (33.8%) sessions consisted of urticaria (12.9%),asymptomatic hypocalcemia (9.6%), and hypotension (9.6%). The median duration of hospitalization was 2.25 days (range, 1-11 days). Sixty-one (98.4%) dogs survivedto discharge, and none were rehospitalized. Thirty-one (91.1%) of the 34 dogswith at least 1 follow-up visit were not azotemic at the time of reevaluation.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This population of dogs managed with TPE hadexcellent outcomes, even in cases of high NSAID dose ingestion. When TPE isavailable and the time frame is appropriate, this extracorporeal modality should be considered for the management of NSAID overdose.

AB  - The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri is known as a highly host-adapted human pathogen. There had been no known other reservoirs reported until recently.Here 34 isolates obtained from animals (yaks, dairy cows and beef cattle) from2016-2017 and 268 human S. flexneri isolates from China were sequenced todetermine the relationships between animal and human isolates and infer theevolutionary history of animal-associated S. flexneri. The 18 animal isolates (15yak and 3 beef cattle isolates) in PG1 were separated into 4 lineages, and the 16animal isolates (1 yak, 5 beef cattle and 10 dairy cow isolates) in PG3 wereclustered in 8 lineages. The most recent human isolates from China belonged toPG3 whereas Chinese isolates from the 1950s-1960s belonged to PG1. PG1 S.flexneri may has been transmitted to the yaks during PG1 circulation in the humanpopulation in China and has remained in the yak population since, while PG3 S.flexneri in animals were likely recent transmissions from the human population.Increased stability of the large virulence plasmid and acquisition of abundantantimicrobial resistance determinants may have enabled PG3 to expand globally andreplaced PG1 in China. Our study confirms that animals may act as a reservoir forS. flexneri. Genomic analysis revealed the evolutionary history of multiple S.flexneri lineages in animals and humans in China. However, further studies arerequired to determine the public health threat of S. flexneri from animals.

AB  - The DPP-4 inhibition is an interesting target for the development of antidiabeticagents which promotes the longevity of GPL-1(Glucagon-like peptide 1). Thecurrent study was intended to assess DPP-4(Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4) inhibitionmediated antidiabetic effect of phytocompounds of an aqueous fruit extract ofWithania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal by in-vitro, in-silico and in-vivo approaches. The phytoconstituents screening was executed by LCMS (Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry). The in-vitro and in-vivo, DPP-4 assays were performed by using available kits. The in-vitro DPP-4 activity was inhibited up to 68.3% bythe test extract. Accordingly, in-silico determinations of molecular docking,molecular dynamics and pharmacokinetics were performed between the target enzyme DPP-4 and leading phytocompounds. The molecular dynamics authenticated themolecular docking data by crucial parameters of cytosolic milieu by the potentialenergy, RSMD (Root Mean Square Deviation), RSMF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation),system density, NVT (Number of particles at fixed volume, ensemble) and NPT(Number of particles at fixed pressure, ensemble). Accordingly, ADMET predictionsassessed the druggability profile. Subsequently, the course of the test extractand the sitagliptin (positive control), instigated significant (p </= 0.001)ameliorations in HOMA indices and the equal of antioxidants innicotinamide-streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetic animal model.Compassionately, the histopathology represented increased pancreatic cellularmass which caused in restoration of histoarchitectures. It has been concludedthat phytoconstituents in W. coagulans aqueous fruit extract can regulate DPP-4, resulting in improved glucose homeostasis and enhanced endocrinal pancreaticcellular mass.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Sperm motility, normal morphology, viability, spermatozoa DNA damage, and lipidperoxidation are all affected by semen cryopreservation. The goal of this studywas to see how effective cupric oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) are as acryo-extender additive on post-thawed sperm parameters. An artificial vagina was used to collect semen samples from five mature Zaraibi bucks (2-3 years).Ejaculates were pooled and separated into two fractions (A&B), a fraction (A) wasleft without being centrifuged and a fraction (B) was centrifuged to removeseminal plasma. Both fractions were diluted with tris egg yolk citrate extender(TECE) and then divided into five equal aliquots, each supplemented with (0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 ppm/ml) CuONPs. The findings revealed that removing seminal plasmabefore cryopreservation harms sperm parameters. Sperm motility, viability index, membrane integrity, biochemical antioxidant marker, DNA integrity, and MDA level improved after supplementation with CuONPs up to 60 ppm/ml, the most prominentsignificant positive effect was obtained with the highest dose (60 ppm/ml)without removal of the seminal plasm compared to control group. In conclusion:The presence of seminal plasma with a high concentration of CuONPs (up to 60ppm/ml) may help to mitigate the negative effects of cryo-preservation.

TI  - The Landscape of Participatory Surveillance Systems Across the One HealthSpectrum: Systematic Review.
PG  - e38551
LID - 10.2196/38551 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Participatory surveillance systems augment traditional surveillancesystems through bidirectional community engagement. The digital platformevolution has enabled the expansion of participatory surveillance systems,globally, for the detection of health events impacting people, animals, plants,and the environment, in other words, across the entire One Health spectrum.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this landscape was to identify and provide descriptiveinformation regarding system focus, geography, users, technology, informationshared, and perceived impact of ongoing participatory surveillance systems acrossthe One Health spectrum. METHODS: This landscape began with a systematicliterature review to identify potential ongoing participatory surveillancesystems. A survey was sent to collect standardized data from the contacts ofsystems identified in the literature review and through direct outreach tostakeholders, experts, and professional organizations. Descriptive analyses ofsurvey and literature review results were conducted across the programs. RESULTS:The landscape identified 60 ongoing single-sector and multisector participatorysurveillance systems spanning five continents. Of these, 29 (48%) include data onhuman health, 26 (43%) include data on environmental health, and 24 (40%) includedata on animal health. In total, 16 (27%) systems are multisectoral; of these, 9 (56%) collect animal and environmental health data; 3 (19%) collect human,animal, and environmental health data; 2 (13%) collect human and environmentalhealth data; and 2 (13%) collect human and animal health data. Out of 60 systems,31 (52%) are designed to cover a national scale, compared to those with asubnational (n=19, 32%) or multinational (n=10, 17%) focus. All systems use some form of digital technology. Email communication or websites (n=40, 67%) andsmartphones (n=29, 48%) are the most common technologies used, with some usingboth. Systems have capabilities to download geolocation data (n=31, 52%),photographs (n=29, 48%), and videos (n=6, 10%), and can incorporate lab data orsample collection (n=15, 25%). In sharing information back with users, most usevisualization, such as maps (n=43, 72%); training and educational materials(n=37, 62%); newsletters, blogs, and emails (n=34, 57%); and disease preventioninformation (n=32, 53%). Out of the 46 systems responding to the survey regardingperceived impacts of their systems, 36 (78%) noted "improved community knowledge and understanding" and 31 (67%) noted "earlier detection." CONCLUSIONS: Thelandscape demonstrated the breadth of applicability of participatory surveillancearound the world to collect data from community members and trained volunteers inorder to inform the detection of events, from invasive plant pests to weeklyinfluenza symptoms. Acknowledging the importance of bidirectionality ofinformation, these systems simultaneously share findings back with the users.Such directly engaged community detection systems capture events early andprovide opportunities to stop outbreaks quickly.

TI  - Genomic dissection of the Vibrio cholerae O-serogroup global reference strains:reassessing our view of diversity and plasticity between two chromosomes.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000860 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 200 O-serogroups of Vibrio cholerae have already been identified;however, only 2 serogroups, O1 and O139, are strongly related to pandemiccholera. The study of non-O1 and non-O139 strains has hitherto been limited.Nevertheless, there are other clinically and epidemiologically importantserogroups causing outbreaks with cholera-like disease. Here, we report acomprehensive genome analysis of the whole set of V. cholerae O-serogroupreference strains to provide an overview of this important bacterial pathogen. Itrevealed structural diversity of the O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters locatedat specific loci on chromosome 1 and 16 pairs of strains with almost identicalO-antigen biosynthetic gene clusters but differing in serological patterns. This might be due to the presence of O-antigen biosynthesis-related genes at secondaryloci on chromosome 2.

AB  - Various studies have shown that the microbial proteins are often more stable thanbelongs to other sources like plant and animal origin. Hence, the interest inmicrobial enzymes has gained much attention due to many potential applicationslike bioenergy, biofuel production, biobleaching, bioconversion and so on.Additionally, recent trends revealed that the interest in isolating novelmicrobes from harsh environments have been the main focus of many scientists for various applications. Basically, industrially important enzymes can becategorized into mainly three groups: carbohydrases, proteases, and lipases.Among those, the enzymes especially carbohydrases involved in production ofsugars. Carbohydrases include amylases, xylanases, pectinases, cellulases,chitinases, mannases, laccases, ligninases, lactase, glucanase, and glucoseoxidase. Thus, here, an approach has been made to highlight five enzymes namelyamylase, cellulase, laccase, pectinase, and xylanase from different sources with special emphasis on their properties, mechanism, applications, productionoptimization, purification, molecular approaches for its enhanced and stableproduction, and also biotechnological perspectives of its future development.Also, green and sustainable catalytic conversion strategies using nanoparticlesof these enzymes have also been discussed. This review will provide insight into the carbohydrases importance and their usefulness that will help to theresearchers working in this field.

The hormone receptors in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer leadbreast cells to proliferate out of control. Cancer therapy such as hormonal,targeted, radiation is still unsatisfactory because of these challenges viz. MDR (Multiple drug resistance), off-targeting, severe adverse effects. A novelaromatase inhibitor exemestane (Exe) exhibits promising therapy in breast cancer.This study aims to develop and optimize Exe-loaded lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) byusing DSPC, PF68 and olive oil as lipid, surfactant and oil phase, respectivelyand to characterize the same. The prepared nanocapsules were investigated viain-vitro cell culture and in-vivo animal models. The LNCs exhibited cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cell lines and enhanced anti-cancer activity and reduced cardiotoxicity in DMBA-induced animal model when compared to the drug. Additionally, in-vivopharmacokinetics revealed a 4.2-fold increased oral bioavailability when comparedwith Exe suspension. This study demonstrated that oral administration ofExe-loaded LNCs holds promise for the antiestrogenic activity of exemestane inbreast cancer.

AB  - Schizophrenia is an incurable mental disorder that affects 1% of the worldpopulation and is among the most disabling human diseases. On average, 70% ofpatients abandon medication due to its low efficacy and the presence of severeside effects. To change these conditions, it is necessary to understand thepathophysiology of schizophrenia at the molecular level. Besides thelong-established neurodevelopmental hypothesis, works based on neuroimaging,postmortem brain proteomics, and pharmacological, genetic, and animal modelstudies have shown dysfunction and deficits in synaptic transmission. Currently, genetic editing has been growing, and the use of this technique has been improvedin the discovery of protein functions; in addition to that, some recent studieshave attributed a path to the use of genetic engineering in the treatment ofdiseases with a genetic nature.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder of neurodevelopmental origin that isthought to result from the combination of genetic and socioenvironmental factors.Several studies have linked the endocannabinoid system with the pathophysiologyof schizophrenia. Here, we provide a brief overview of the role of theendocannabinoid system (ECS) in the context of biological processes relevant toschizophrenia, such as neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and brain energymetabolism. We also discuss alterations related to the ECS in schizophrenia andcurrent efforts in both in vivo and in vitro studies that have provided a better understanding of the functioning of this system in the context of the disorder.Finally, we highlighted the modulation of the ECS as a potential for discovering novel therapeutic targets, suggesting new avenues for future research in thefield.

AB  - Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins occur in all domains of life,affecting various structural and functional properties. Multiple methods can beused to study PTMs depending on the biological question, which can vary widely.Schizophrenia is a widespread brain disorder that possesses many knowncontributing environmental factors and hundreds of genetic risk factors; however,a full picture of the mechanisms behind how and why this disorder occurs and how it can be treated remains unknown. Various PTMs have been found to bedifferentially expressed in several pathways that are dysregulated inschizophrenia, as seen in cell line and animal models, postmortem brain tissuefrom people with schizophrenia, and biological fluids like blood, plasma, andcerebrospinal fluid. Despite recent advances, several pathways have beencompletely left undisturbed by PTMomics and show great promise for betterunderstanding of protein dynamics in schizophrenia, how the disease state occurs,and how it may be better treated in future therapies.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental psychiatricdisorder characterized by a variety of symptoms classically grouped into threemain domains: positive (hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder) andnegative symptoms (social withdrawal, lack of affect) and cognitive dysfunction(attention, working and episodic memory functions, and processing speed). Thisdisorder places an immense emotional and economic pressure on the individual and society-at-large. Although the etiology of schizophrenia is not completely known,it is proposed to involve abnormalities in neurodevelopmental processes anddysregulation in the signaling mediated by several neurotransmitters, such asdopamine, glutamate, and GABA. Preclinical research using animal models areessential in our understanding of disease development and pathology as well asthe discovery and advance of novel treatment choices. Here we describe rodentmodels for studying schizophrenia, including those based on the effects of drugs (pharmacological models), neurodevelopmental disruption, demyelination, andgenetic alterations. The advantages and limitations of such models arehighlighted. We also discussed the great potential of proteomic technologies inunraveling the molecular mechanism of schizophrenia through animal models.

PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-97182-3_1 [doi]
AB  - Modeling schizophrenia is challenging due to the uniquely human component ofpsychiatric disorders. Despite several advances in cellular and animal modeling, postmortem brain tissue derived from patients is still one of the extremely fewsources of information that comprises brain complexity, human genetics, andpatient experiences. Additionally, postmortem tissue from patients withschizophrenia can be used to drive hypotheses that can then be validated in othermodels, involving either other animals or an in vitro approach. While evaluating high-throughput and sensitive techniques, shotgun proteomics allows for theidentification and quantitation of thousands of proteins present in biologicalsystems. In the context of schizophrenia, proteomics can map differentiallyregulated proteins throughout brain regions of patients with schizophrenia,generating a large amount of information regarding the disorder'spathophysiology. In this chapter, our aim is to bring the literature up to dateregarding proteomics tools applied to postmortem brains from patients withschizophrenia, additionally discussing new findings, roads, and perspectives for the comprehension of this severe disorder.

TI  - Modelling acute myeloid leukemia (AML): What's new? A transition from theclassical to the modern.
LID - 10.1007/s13346-022-01189-4 [doi]
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignancy affecting myeloidcells in the bone marrow (BM) but can spread giving rise to impairedhematopoiesis. AML incidence increases with age and is associated with poorprognostic outcomes. There has been a disconnect between the success of noveldrug compounds observed in preclinical studies of hematological malignancy andless than exceptional therapeutic responses in clinical trials. This review aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview on the different preclinical models of AMLavailable to expand insights into disease pathology and as preclinical screening tools. Deciphering the complex physiological and pathological processes anddeveloping predictive preclinical models are key to understanding diseaseprogression and fundamental in the development and testing of new effective drug treatments. Standard scaffold-free suspension models fail to recapitulate thecomplex environment where AML occurs. To this end, we review advances inscaffold/matrix-based 3D models and outline the most recent advances in on-chiptechnology. We also provide an overview of clinically relevant animal models and review the expanding use of patient-derived samples, which offer the prospect to create more "patient specific" screening tools either in the guise of 3D matrixmodels, microphysiological "organ-on-chip" tools or xenograft models and discuss representative examples.

TI  - Association of dietary proteins with serum creatinine and estimated glomerularfiltration rate in a general population sample: the CHRIS study.
LID - 10.1007/s40620-022-01409-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is known to affect kidney function. However, population-basedstudies provide contrasting evidence, resulting in a poor understanding of theeffect of proteins from specific foods on kidney health. METHODS: We analyzed theeffect of total daily protein intake (TDPI) and source-specific daily proteinintake (DPI) on fasting serum creatinine (SCr) and estimated glomerularfiltration rate (eGFR) in the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) cross-sectional study (n = 5889), using the GA(2)LEN food frequency questionnairefor TDPI and DPI estimation. We fitted multivariable adjusted mixed models of SCrand eGFR on TDPI and DPI quartiles (Q1-Q4) in the overall sample, and afterremoving individuals with known hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Higher TDPI as well as DPI from overall animal sources, fish, andpoultry, were associated with higher SCr (trend test p, ptrend < 0.01), withlarger effect after excluding individuals with known hypertension, diabetes orCKD. The eGFR was lower at higher TDPI (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 95% CI - 2.5, - 0.7; ptrend = 3e-4) and DPI from fish (Q4 vs Q1: - 2.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2);95% CI - 2.9, - 1.20; ptrend = 4.3e-6), overall animal source (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.6ml/min/1.73 m(2); 95% CI -2.5, - 0.8), processed meat (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.4ml/min/1.73 m(2); ptrend = 0.027), red meat, offal and processed meat (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2); ptrend = 0.015) and poultry (Q4 vs Q1: - 0.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2); ptrend = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: TDPI and DPI from specific animal sourceswere positively associated with SCr and negatively associated with eGFR. Lacking an alternative marker of kidney function, confounding involving muscle massmetabolism cannot be fully excluded.

TI  - Playing it by ear: gregarious sparrows recognize and respond to isolated wingbeatsounds and predator-based cues.
LID - 10.1007/s10071-022-01663-z [doi]
AB  - The ability to detect an incoming attack provides a final opportunity for ananimal to avoid predation. In birds, vision is the main sensory mode in detectingattacks, but auditory cues likely play an important role. The role of auditorycues from predators themselves remains largely unstudied. We evaluated theability of free-living, gregarious sparrows (Passerellidae) to recognize attacks based on the non-vocal sounds made by predators or indirect auditory cues ofongoing attacks, mainly in the form of brief wingbeat sequences from predatoryand non-predatory birds. Behavioral responses to playbacks were video-recordedand expressed in terms of a flock's propensity to respond, either by flushing to cover, becoming vigilant, or both. Sparrows responded equally to hawk wingbeatsand those of small passerines. Both predator and non-predator wingbeat sequences induced anti-predator responses, especially when played loudly. Loud controlsounds, such as hammering, induced few responses. Birds also responded to thesounds of a walking and running terrestrial predator (a dog), but reactions tothe walking predator often involved birds jumping onto objects for a better view of their surroundings rather than immediate flight to cover. In an additionalexperiment, we examined how characteristics of wingbeat sequences (i.e., thenumber and cadence of hawk wingbeats) affected passerine responses. It indicated that only two consecutive hawk wingbeats, presented at a natural cadence, arenecessary to elicit a strong response to a playback. Single hawk wingbeatsinduced only weak escape responses, as did artificially slowed cadences. Birds ingeneral likely possess the ability to recognize non-vocal, auditory cues ofincoming attacks, which may be produced by approaching threats or departingcongeners.

LID - 10.1007/s10071-022-01657-x [doi]
AB  - While personality and cognition are distinct domains, some personality traits mayaffect the capacity for problem-solving. It was suggested that there is apositive association between the Playfulness trait and problem-solvingperformance in humans. Studies on giftedness (extremely good capacity in the caseof a specific skill), typically aimed to reveal the genetic, experiential, andmental origins of such extreme inter-individual variation. We exploited recentfindings on giftedness in a specific cognitive skill, object label learning, indogs to explore the potential association between this exceptional skill andpersonality traits. We administered the Dog Personality Questionnaire to 21gifted dog owners and compared the personality traits of their dogs to those ofmatched samples of 43 Hungarian and 101 Austrian typical dogs, i.e., dogs lackingthis exceptional capacity. Since most Gifted Word Learner dogs are Bordercollies, we restricted our analysis to dogs of this breed. We hypothesized thatthe Gifted Word Learner dogs may show higher levels of Playfulness. As expected, we found that the gifted Border collies were rated as more playful than both the Hungarian and Austrian typical ones. Our results suggest that an extremely highlevel of Playfulness is associated with giftedness in a specific cognitive trait in dogs: the capacity to learn object verbal labels, thus opening newpossibilities for comparative research on the relationship between giftedness andpersonality.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of substitution of siris foliage with alfalfa forage in the diet of fattening lambs on digestibility, fermentation, andgrowth performance of fattening lambs. In the present experiment, 27 8-month-old Arabi lambs (31.3 +/- 6) with an initial weight of 28.8 +/- 1.99 kg were used in a completely randomized design. The effect of experimental diets on dry matterintake was not significant; however, the diets had a significant effect on theintake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crudeprotein (P < 0.05). The effect of experimental diets on the apparentdigestibility of dry matter, organic matter, NDF, ADF, and crude protein was not significant (P < 0.05). Ammonia nitrogen concentration, pH, and a totalpopulation of ruminal fluid protozoa and blood parameters were not affected byexperimental diets. Parameters of fattening performance such as feed intake, liveweight changes, feed conversion ratio, some carcass traits such as mean weightand size of carcass parts, and colorimetric indices of muscle tissue in the orderof fattening lambs were not affected by experimental diets. The use of foliage ofsiris in the diet of fattening lambs as a substitute with part of alfalfa had no adverse effect on the characteristics studied in the present experiment.Therefore, siris be recommended as part of the diet of fattening lambs.

LID - 10.1007/s10739-022-09681-w [doi]
AB  - This article explores the collaborative research of the Nobel laureate HansSpemann (1869-1941) and the Swiss zoologist Fritz Baltzer (1884-1974) on problemsat the intersection of development and heredity and raises more general questionsconcerning science and politics in Germany in the interwar period. It argues thatSpemann and Baltzer's collaborative work made a significant contribution to thethen ongoing debates about the relation between developmental physiology andhereditary studies, although Spemann distanced himself from Drosophila geneticsbecause of his anti-reductionist position. The article analyzes how Spemannframed the issues of heredity in terms of an epigenetic principle in the context of his work on the "organizer," and it explores the experimental dynamics ofresearch on newt merogones carried out by Baltzer in a methodological developmentof Spemann's constriction experiments. Finally, these research attempts arediscussed as part of a broader "prehistory" of the mid-twentieth century cellnuclear transplantation experiments, which provided the basis for later animalcloning.

TI  - Sugar Concentration, Nitrogen Availability, and Phylogenetic Factors Determinethe Ability of Acinetobacter spp. and Rosenbergiella spp. to Grow in FloralNectar.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-022-02088-4 [doi]
AB  - The floral nectar of angiosperms harbors a variety of microorganisms that depend predominantly on animal visitors for their dispersal. Although some members ofthe genus Acinetobacter and all currently known species of Rosenbergiella arethought to be adapted to thrive in nectar, there is limited information about theresponse of these bacteria to variation in the chemical characteristics of floralnectar. We investigated the growth performance of a diverse collection ofAcinetobacter (n = 43) and Rosenbergiella (n = 45) isolates obtained from floral nectar and the digestive tract of flower-visiting bees in a set of 12 artificial nectars differing in sugar content (15% w/v or 50% w/v), nitrogen content(3.48/1.67 ppm or 348/167 ppm of total nitrogen/amino nitrogen), and sugarcomposition (only sucrose, 1/3 sucrose + 1/3 glucose + 1/3 fructose, or 1/2glucose + 1/2 fructose). Growth was only observed in four of the 12 artificialnectars. Those containing elevated sugar concentration (50% w/v) and low nitrogencontent (3.48/1.67 ppm) were limiting for bacterial growth. Furthermore,phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ability of the bacteria to grow indifferent types of nectar is highly conserved between closely related isolatesand genotypes, but this conservatism rapidly vanishes deeper in phylogeny.Overall, these results demonstrate that the ability of Acinetobacter spp. andRosenbergiella spp. to grow in floral nectar largely depends on nectar chemistry and bacterial phylogeny.

TI  - Effects of Ran-GTP/importin beta inhibition on the meiotic division of porcineoocytes.
LID - 10.1007/s00418-022-02134-9 [doi]
AB  - The Ran-GTP/importin beta pathway has been implicated in a diverse array ofmitotic functions in somatic mitosis; however, the possible meiotic roles ofRan-GTP/importin beta in mammalian oocyte meiosis are still not fully understood.In the present study, importazole (IPZ), a small molecule inhibitor of theinteraction between Ran and importin beta was used to explore the potentialmeiotic roles of Ran-GTP/importin beta in porcine oocytes undergoing meiosis.After IPZ treatment, the extrusion rate of the first polar body (PB1) wassignificantly decreased, and a higher proportion of the oocytes were arrested at the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) stage. Moreover, IPZ treatment led tosevere defects in metaphase I (MI) spindle assembly and chromosome alignmentduring the germinal vesicle (GV)-to-MI stage, as well as failure of metaphase II (MII) spindle reassembly and homologous chromosome segregation during theMI-to-MII stage. Notably, IPZ treatment decreased TPX2 expression and abnormalsubcellular localization. Furthermore, the expression levels of aurora kinase A(AURKA) and transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 (TACC3) were significantly reduced after IPZ treatment. Collectively, these data indicate that the interaction ofRan-GTP and importin beta is essential for proper spindle assembly and successfulchromosome segregation during two consecutive meiotic divisions in porcineoocytes, and regulation of this complex might be related to its effect on theTPX2 signaling cascades.

TI  - Hyperresponsiveness to Extracellular Acidification-Mediated Contraction inIsolated Bronchial Smooth Muscles of Murine Experimental Asthma.
LID - 10.1007/s00408-022-00558-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Extracellular acidification is a major component of tissue inflammation,including airway inflammation. The extracellular proton-sensing mechanisms areinherent in various cells including airway structural cells, although theirphysiological and pathophysiological roles in bronchial smooth muscles (BSMs) arenot fully understood. In the present study, to explore the functional role ofextracellular acidification on the BSM contraction, the isolated mouse BSMs were exposed to acidic pH under contractile stimulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: TheRT-PCR analyses revealed that the proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors wereexpressed both in mouse BSMs and cultured human BSM cells. In the mouse BSMs,change in the extracellular pH from 8.0 to 6.8 caused an augmentation ofcontraction induced by acetylcholine. Interestingly, the acidic pH-induced BSMhyper-contraction was further augmented in the mice that were sensitized andrepeatedly challenged with ovalbumin antigen. In this animal model of asthma,upregulations of G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68) and GPR65, that werebelieved to be coupled with Gq and Gs proteins respectively, were observed,indicating that the acidic pH could cause hyper-contraction probably via anactivation of GPR68. However, psychosine, a putative antagonist for GPR68, failedto block the acidic pH-induced responses. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest thatextracellular acidification contributes to the airway hyperresponsiveness, acharacteristic feature of bronchial asthma. Further studies are required toidentify the receptor(s) responsible for sensing extracellular protons in BSMcells.

TI  - Evidence for cognitive impairment in patients with vestibular disorders.
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11289-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Extensive animal research has shown that vestibular damage can beassociated with cognitive deficits. More recently, new evidence has emergedlinking vestibular disorders to cognitive impairment in humans. Herein, we reviewcontemporary research on the pathophysiology of cognitive-vestibular interactionsand discuss its emerging clinical relevance. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, andCochrane databases. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed with combinations of search terms: "cognition," "cognitive impairment," "chronic fatigue," "brain fog," "spatial navigation," "attention," "memory," "executivefunction," "processing speed," and "vestibular hypofunction." Relevant articleswere considered for inclusion, including basic and clinical studies, case series,and major reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with vestibular disorders candemonstrate long-term deficits in both spatial and nonspatial cognitive domains. The underlying mechanism(s) linking the vestibular system to cognitive functionis not well characterized, but several neuro-biologic correlates have beenidentified. Additional screening tools are required to identify individuals atrisk for cognitive impairment, and further research is needed to determinewhether treatment of vestibular dysfunction has the capacity to improve cognitivefunction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Physicians should be aware of emerging data supporting the presence of cognitive deficits in patients with vestibulardisorders. Prevention and treatment of long-term cognitive deficits may bepossible through screening and rehabilitation.

TI  - Preclinical characterization of AZD5305, a next generation, highly selectivePARP1 inhibitor and trapper.
LID - CCR-22-0301 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0301 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesized that inhibition and trapping of PARP1 alone would besufficient to achieve anti-tumor activity. In particular, we aimed to achieveselectivity over PARP2, which has been shown to a play role in the survival ofhematopoietic/stem progenitor cells in animal models. We developed AZD5305 withthe aim to achieve improved clinical efficacy and wider therapeutic window. This next generation PARPi could provide a paradigm shift in clinical outcomesachieved by first generation PARPi, particularly in combination. PATIENTS ANDMETHODS: AZD5305 was tested in vitro for PARylation inhibition, PARP-DNA trappingand antiproliferative abilities. In vivo efficacy was determined in mousexenograft and PDX models. The potential for hematological toxicity was evaluated in rat models as monotherapy and combination. RESULTS: AZD5305 is a highly potentand selective inhibitor of PARP1 with 500-fold selectivity for PARP1 over PARP2. AZD5305 inhibits growth in cells with deficiencies in DNA repair, with minimal/noeffects in other cells. Unlike first generation PARPi, AZD5305 has minimaleffects on hematological parameters in a rat pre-clinical model at predictedclinically efficacious exposures. Animal models treated with AZD5305 at doses>/=0.1mg/kg QD achieved greater depth of tumor regression compared to olaparib100mg/kg QD, and longer duration of response. CONCLUSIONS: AZD5305 potently andselectively inhibits PARP1 resulting in excellent antiproliferative activity and unprecedented selectivity for DNA repair deficient versus proficient cells. Thesedata confirm the hypothesis that targeting only PARP1 can retain therapeuticbenefits of non-selective PARPi, while reducing potential for hematotoxicity.AZD5305 is currently in Ph1 trials (NCT04644068).

TI  - Toward a decade of ocean science for sustainable development through acousticanimal tracking.
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16343 [doi]
AB  - The ocean is a key component of the Earth's dynamics, providing a great varietyof ecosystem services to humans. Yet, human activities are globally changing its structure and major components, including marine biodiversity. In this context,the United Nations has proclaimed a Decade of Ocean Science for SustainableDevelopment to tackle the scientific challenges necessary for a sustainable useof the ocean by means of the Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14). Here, wereview how Acoustic animal Tracking, a widely distributed methodology of trackingmarine biodiversity with electronic devices, can provide a roadmap forimplementing the major Actions to achieve the SDG14. We show that acoustictracking can be used to reduce and monitor the effects of marine pollutionincluding noise, light, and plastic pollution. Acoustic tracking can beeffectively used to monitor the responses of marine biodiversity to human-madeinfrastructures and habitat restoration, as well as to determine the effects ofhypoxia, ocean warming, and acidification. Acoustic tracking has beenhistorically used to inform fisheries management, the design of marine protected areas, and the detection of essential habitats, rendering this techniqueparticularly attractive to achieve the sustainable fishing and spatial protectiontarget goals of the SDG14. Finally, acoustic tracking can contribute to endillegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing by providing tools to monitor marinebiodiversity against poachers and promote the development of Small IslandsDeveloping States and developing countries. To fully benefit from acoustictracking supporting the SDG14 Targets, trans-boundary collaborative effortsthrough tracking networks are required to promote ocean information sharing andocean literacy. We therefore propose acoustic tracking and tracking networks asrelevant contributors to tackle the scientific challenges that are necessary for a sustainable use of the ocean promoted by the United Nations.

TI  - A Review of Corneal Biomechanics and Scleral Stiffness in Topical ProstaglandinAnalog Therapy for Glaucoma.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2022.2099903 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The mechanism of action underlying prostaglandin analog (PGA) therapyinvolves changes in the expression of different metalloproteases to increasepermeability of the sclera and allow increased aqueous humor outflow through thisalternative drainage pathway. This alteration of structure impacts cornea/scleralbiomechanics and may introduce artifact into the measurement of intraocularpressure (IOP) in the clinical setting. METHODS: A literature search reviewingthe impact of PGA therapy on corneal and scleral biomechanics was conductedincluding basic studies, clinical studies with treatment naive patients, and aclinical study examining the cessation of PGA therapy. Additional literatureincluding engineering texts was added for greater clarity of the conceptsunderlying ocular biomechanics. RESULTS: One study with an animal model reported significant corneal stiffening with PGA treatment. Most longitudinal clinicalstudies examining the effects of initiation of PGA therapy in PGA naive subjects failed to report biomechanical parameters associated with stiffness using theCorvis ST and only included those parameters strongly influenced by IOP. Onestudy reported a significant reduction in scleral stiffness with IOP as aco-variate, highlighting the need to account for the effects of IOP lowering whenassessing clinical biomechanics. The report of cessation of PGA therapy oncorneal biomechanics showed no change in corneal compensated IOP after 6 weeks,raising the question of reversibility of the PGA-induced structural alteration.CONCLUSIONS: Given that the findings in several clinical studies may merelyreflect a reduction in IOP, further studies are warranted using Corvis STparameters associated with corneal and scleral stiffness. The gold standard forIOP measurement in the clinical setting is Goldmann applanation tonometry, atechnique previously shown to be affected by corneal stiffness. Since PGA therapyhas been reported to alter not only scleral biomechanics, but also cornealbiomechanics, it is essential to consider alternative tonometry technologies inthe clinic.

TI  - Ordinal or visual analogue scales for assessing aspects of broiler chickenwelfare?
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/10888705.2022.2105648 [doi]
AB  - When the gradation of animal welfare is scored through ordinal scales andequidistant tags are used, empirical data between tags tend to benon-equidistant. Ordinal rate scales (ORS) and visual analogue scales (VAS) were tested for the assessment of contact dermatitis on breast and abdominal areas(CD), footpad dermatitis (FP), hock burns (HB) and bird soiling (BS) in broilerchickens. Calculations regarding the inter-rater reliability, the correlationbetween VAS and ORS and amongst the welfare indicators measured with both scales,and the equidistance of ORS categories in relation to values measured using VAS, were made. A total of 1,303 broiler chickens from 10 flocks was assessed on-farm by three raters using both scales. Inter-rater reliabilities of CD and HB werehigher when using VAS compared with ORS, but FP was lower. Correlations betweenscales varied between 0.90-0.97 and 0.77-0.95 (P<0.001), considering mean andindividual values. Low-to-moderate correlations were observed between the fourindicators using the scales. Tags on VAS that best represented ORS werenon-equidistant. Results suggest both scales were reliable assessing the selectedbroiler chicken welfare indicators.

TI  - Technical notes for establishing a cervical fusion model in goats based ondistinctive anatomy.
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEC.2022.0133 [doi]
AB  - Goat is an adequate experimental model for cervical spine testing. However,studies on the anatomy of the cervical spine in goats are limited, and there isno uniform standard for establishing a single-segment anterior cervicaldiscectomy and fusion (ACDF) model in goats. To address this issue, weinvestigated the cervical spine anatomy of goats and provided a technical basisfor establishing a single-segment ACDF model in goats. We measured the imaginganatomical parameters using Mimics Medical 20.0 software. We then performedhistological analysis of the C2-3 segment of six goat cervical spine specimens.Based on the measurements and histological analysis, the fusion cage was designedto be wedge-shaped, and the length of the plate was 25mm, the length of the screwwas 15mm. Based on the anatomical characteristics of goats, we believed that the C2-3 segment of goats was most suitable for a single-segment ACDF model in goats,and the decompression should be performed medial to the pterygoid joint on bothsides, the thickness of the removed endplate was approximately 0.6 mm, the cageimplanted in the anterior two-thirds of the intervertebral space could maximizethe contact area of the cage-endplate interface, the location of the midline spurcould position the implantation of the internal fixtures. Radiologicalexamination at 12 weeks postoperatively suggested that the internal fixtures werein place and new bone formation was visible. These results demonstrated thatthese technical notes based on anatomical features were practical and couldminimizes damage to animal.

TI  - Discovery of non-autonomous modulators of activated Ras.
LID - jkac200 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkac200 [doi]
AB  - Communication between mesodermal cells and epithelial cells is fundamental tonormal animal development and is frequently disrupted in cancer. However, thegenes and processes that mediate this communication are incompletely understood. To identify genes that mediate this communication and alter the proliferation of cells with an oncogenic Ras genotype, we carried out a tissue-specificgenome-wide RNAi screen in C. elegans animals bearing a let-60(n1046gf) (RasG13E)allele. The screen identifies 24 genes that, when knocked down in adjacentmesodermal tissue, suppress the increased vulval epithelial cell proliferationdefect associated with let-60(n1046gf). Importantly, gene knockdown reverts themutant animals to a wild-type phenotype. Using chimeric animals, we geneticallyconfirm that two of the genes function non-autonomously to revert thelet-60(n1046gf) phenotype. The effect is genotype-restricted, as knockdown doesnot alter development in a wild type (let-60(+)) or activated EGF receptor(let-23(sa62gf)) background. Although many of the genes identified encodeproteins involved in essential cellular processes including chromatin formation, ribosome function and mitochondrial ATP metabolism, knockdown does not alter the normal development or function of targeted mesodermal tissues, indicating thatthe phenotype derives from specific functions performed by these cells. We showthat the genes act in a manner distinct from two signal ligand classes (EGF andWnt) known to influence the development of vulval epithelial cells. Altogether,the results identify genes with a novel function in mesodermal cells required forcommunicating with and promoting the proliferation of adjacent epithelial cellswith an activated Ras genotype.

TI  - Sperm degradation after vasectomy follows a sperm chromatin fragmentationdependent mechanism causing DNA breaks in the toroid linker regions.
LID - gaac029 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/molehr/gaac029 [doi]
AB  - Vasectomy is a widely used surgical technique creating an obstructiveazoospermia. Although sperm cannot be ejaculated, the testis maintains spermproduction in vasectomized males. The continuous accumulation of sperm deposited in the epididymis and the vas deferens fraction necessarily need to be degradedand eliminated. While the elimination process is carried out by granulomas thatform after vasectomy, the detailed mechanisms of sperm degradation are still not known. The aim was to assess whether sperm chromatin fragmentation (SCF), amechanism that degrades the entire sperm genome at the toroid linker regions(TLR), is activated after vasectomy in sperm cells. We vasectomized mice andevaluated the presence of TLR-specific double-strand breaks through pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and the Comet assay at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after surgery.Results for DNA damage (Olive tail moment) at single-cell level showed anincrease of double-strand breaks after vasectomy for vas deferens sperm after 1, 2 and 3 weeks post-vasectomy (21.78 +/- 2.29; 19.71 +/- 1.79 and 32.59 +/- 1.81, respectively), compared to mock surgery (7.04 +/- 1.03; 10.10 +/- 1.29 and 8.64+/- 0.85, respectively; P < 0.001). Similar findings were obtained for caudaepididymis sperm (P < 0.001), but not for caput epididymis (P > 0.05).Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed the presence of double-stranded breaksbetween 15 kb and 145 kb, indicating that DNA breaks were produced mainly in the sperm TLRs. Results presented here suggest that SCF is a mechanism activated invas deferens after vasectomy to degrade sperm DNA when they cannot be ejaculated,preventing their function.

TI  - High-Efficiency Near-Infrared Light Responsive Antibacterial System forSynergistic Ablation of Bacteria and Biofilm.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c08406 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infection is seriously threatening human health, and the design ofhigh-efficiency and good biocompatibility antibacterial agents is an urgentproblem to be solved. However, with the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, theexisting antibacterial agents have low killing efficiency, and the formation ofbiofilms has further weakened the therapeutic effect. Herein, we constructed anefficient antibacterial system mediated by near-infrared light for synergisticantibacterial and biofilm dissipation. Specifically, the ZnO/Ti3C2Tx withheterojunction was synthesized by hydrothermal growth of ZnO on the surface oflamellar Ti3C2Tx-MXene. The prepared ZnO/Ti3C2Tx had better photothermal ability than ZnO and Ti3C2Tx, respectively. The local thermal effect can not only destroythe integrity of the bacterial membrane but also promote the release of Zn(2+)ions and further improve the antibacterial performance. ZnO/Ti3C2Tx achieved a100% sterilization rate (better than either ZnO or Ti3C2Tx) at 150 mug mL(-1).The biofilm dissipation experiment further proved its excellent biofilm ablation effect. More importantly, the results of in vitro cell culture and animalexperiments have demonstrated its good biological safety. In summary, this newtype of nanomaterial shows strong local chemical photothermal sterilizationability and has great potential to replace traditional antibacterial agents.

AB  - Osteoporosis deteriorates bone mass and biomechanical strength and islife-threatening to the elderly. In this study, we found that methyl3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (MDHB), an antioxidant small-molecule compound extractedfrom natural plants, inhibits receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB(NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, MDHBattenuates the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) andNF-kappaB pathways by reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whichleads to downregulated protein expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor ofactivated T cells c1 (NFATc1). We also confirmed that MDHB upregulates theprotein expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), animportant transcription factor involved in ROS regulation, by inhibiting theubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation of Nrf2. Next, animal experimentsshowed that MDHB has an effective therapeutic effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-and ovariectomized (OVX)-induced bone loss in mice. Our study demonstrated thatMDHB could upregulate Nrf2 and suppress excessive osteoclast activity in mice to treat osteoporosis.

LID - 10.1039/d2tb01165d [doi]
AB  - A quintinite nanoplate ((64)Cu-QT-NP) isomorphically substituted with (64)Cu, as the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging material, was prepared viatwo-step processes. A (64)Cu labeling efficiency of 99% was realized, for thefirst time, by immobilizing the (64)Cu radioisotope directly in the octahedralsite of the 2-dimensional (2D) quintinite lattice. Furthermore, the (64)Culabeling stability of (64)Cu-QT-NPs was also achieved to be more thanapproximately 99% in various solutions such as saline, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and other biological media (mouse and human serums). In an in vivoxenograft mouse model, the passive targeting behavior of (64)Cu-QT-NPs into tumortissue based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect was alsodemonstrated by parenteral administration, and successfully visualized using aPET scanner. For enhancing the tumor tissue selectivity, bovine serum albumin(BSA) was coated on (64)Cu-QT-NPs to form (64)Cu-QT-NPs/BSA, resulting in better colloidal stability and longer blood circulation time, which was eventuallyevidenced by the 2-fold higher tumor uptake rate when intravenousely injected in an animal model. It is, therefore, concluded that the present (64)Cu-QT-NPs/BSAwith tumor tissue selectivity could be an advanced nano-device for radio-imaging and diagnosis as well.

TI  - Effects and potential mechanism of Ca(2+)/calmodulindependent protein kinase IIpathway inhibitor KN93 on the development of ovarian follicle.
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2022.5177 [doi]
LID - 121 [pii]
AB  - Adequate regulation of the speed of follicular development has been reported toprolong the reproductive life of the ovary. The aim of the present study was toassess the potential effects and mechanism of the Ca(2+)/calmodulindependentprotein kinase II (CaMKII) pathway on the development of ovarian follicle. In thepresent study, the expression of CaMKII was measured in the ovary of mice atdifferent developmental stages by immunofluorescence, confirming that CaMKII has a role in follicular development. Subsequently, the 17.5 days postcoitus (dpc)embryonic ovaries were collected and cultured with KN93 for 4 days in vitro. Itwas revealed that KN93 inhibited the development of follicles, where it reducedthe expression levels of oocyte and granulosa cell markers DEADbox helicase 4(DDX4) and forkhead box L2 (FOXL2). These results suggested that KN93 could delayfollicular development. Proteomics technology was then used to find that 262proteins of KN93 treated 17.5 dpc embryonic ovaries were significantly alteredafter in vitro culture. Bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze these alteredproteins. In total, four important Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomepathways, namely steroid biosynthesis, p53 signaling pathway and retinolmetabolism and metabolic pathways, were particularly enriched. Further analysisrevealed that the upregulated proteins NADPdependent steroid dehydrogenaselike(Nsdhl), lanosterol synthase (Lss), farnesyldiphosphate farnesyltransferase 1(Fdft1), cytochrome P450 family 51 family A member 1 (Cyp51a1),hydroxymethylglutarylCoA synthase 1 (Hmgcs1), fatty acid synthase (Fasn) anddimethylallyltranstransferase (Fdps) were directly interacting with each other inthe four enriched pathways. In summary, the potential mechanism of KN93 inslowing down follicular development most likely lies in its inhibitory effects onCaMKII, which upregulated the expression of Nsdhl, Lss, Fdft1, Cyp51a1, Hmgcs1,Fasn and Fdps. This downregulated the expression of oocyte and granulosa cellmarkers DDX4 and FOXL2 in the follicles, thereby delaying follicular development.Overall, these results provide novel insight into the potential mechanism bywhich KN93 and CaMKII can delay follicular development.

LID - 10.1242/dmm.049566 [doi]
AB  - Melanoma heterogeneity and plasticity underlie therapy resistance. Some tumourcells possess innate resistance, while others reprogramme during drug exposureand survive to form persister cells, a source of potential cancer cells forrecurrent disease. Tracing individual melanoma cell populations through tumourregression and into recurrent disease remains largely unexplored, in part,because complex animal models are required for live imaging of cell populationsover time. Here, we apply tamoxifen-inducible creERt2/loxP lineage tracing to azebrafish model of MITF-dependent melanoma regression and recurrence to image andtrace cell populations in vivo through disease stages. Using this strategy, weshow that melanoma persister cells at the minimal residual disease site originatefrom the primary tumour. Next, we fate mapped rare MITF-independent persistercells and demonstrate that these cells directly contribute to progressivedisease. Multiplex immunohistochemistry confirmed MITF-independent persistercells give rise to Mitfa+ cells in recurrent disease. Taken together, our workreveals a direct contribution of persister cell populations to recurrent disease,and provides a resource for lineage tracing methodology in adult zebrafish cancermodels.

AB  - Primordial germ cells transplantation is a unique approach for conservation andreconstitution of endangered fish species. This study aimed to establishtechniques to culture dechorionated embryos in different incubation systems andalso to determine anaesthetic concentration for fish recipients in the larvalstage for subsequent primordial germ cell transplantation. Intact anddechorionated embryos were divided into three incubation systems: (1) a controlgroup with manual replacement of the solution; (2) a closed environment with highoxygen with manual replacement of the solution; and (3) constant solutionrecirculation. This combination resulted in six treatments. For the evaluation ofanaesthetics for larvae, the concentrations evaluated were 19.5 mM, 24.4 mM, 29.3mM, and 34.2 mM of 2-phenoxyethanol. Anaesthesia concentration and recovery atdifferent stages were evaluated. For transplantation, primordial germ cells ofAstyanax altiparanae were transplanted into anaesthetised larvae (1 dph) ofProchilodus lineatus. Better results were obtained in the recirculation systemfor dechorionated embryos of P. lineatus for hatching (54.18%) and normalmorphology (50.06%). The 2-phenoxyethanol anaesthetic with a dose of 29.3 mMresulted in shorter induction times, in addition to the recovery time between 5and 10 min. By using this anaesthetic concentration at transplantation,GFP-positive cells were seen in two recipients, but the cells did notproliferate. This study established an effective incubation system for thedevelopment of the dechorionated embryo and determined an effective anaestheticconcentration for P. lineatus larvae. In addition, micromanipulation andtransplantation of primordial germ cells in neotropical species were conductedfor the first time.

TI  - DCBLD2 regulates vascular hyperplasia by modulating the platelet derived growthfactor receptor-beta endocytosis through Caveolin-1 in vascular smooth musclecells.
PG  - e22488
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200156RR [doi]
AB  - DCBLD2 is a neuropilin-like transmembrane protein that is up-regulated duringarterial remodeling in humans, rats, and mice. Activation of PDGFR-beta via PDGF triggers receptor phosphorylation and endocytosis. Subsequent activation ofdownstream signals leads to the stimulation of phenotypic conversion of VSMCs andarterial wall proliferation, which are common pathological changes in vascularremodeling diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis afterangioplasty. In this study, we hypothesized that DCBLD2 regulates neointimalhyperplasia through the regulation of PDGFR-beta endocytosis of vascular smoothmuscle cells (VSMCs) through Caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Compared with wild-type (WT)mice or control littermate mice, the germline or VSMC conditional deletion of theDcbld2 gene resulted in a significant increase in the thickness of the tunicamedia in the carotid artery ligation. To elucidate the underlying molecularmechanisms, VSMCs were isolated from the aorta of WT or Dcbld2(-/-) mice and werestimulated with PDGF. Western blotting assays demonstrated that Dcbld2 deletionincreased the PDGF signaling pathway. Biotin labeling test and membrane-cytosolseparation test showed that after DCBLD2 was knocked down or knocked out, thelevel of PDGFR-beta on the cell membrane was significantly reduced, while theamount of PDGFR-beta in the cytoplasm increased. Co-immunoprecipitationexperiments showed that after DCBLD2 gene knock-out, the binding of PDGFR-betaand Cav-1 in the cytoplasm significantly increased. Double immunofluorescencestaining showed that PDGFR-beta accumulated Cav-1/lysosomes earlier than forcontrol cells, which indicated that DCBLD2 gene knock-down or deletionaccelerated the endocytosis of PDGF-induced PDGFR-beta in VSMCs. In order toconfirm that DCBLD2 affects the relationship between Cav-1 and PDGFR-beta,proteins extracted from VSMCs cultured in vitro were derived from WT andDcbld2(-/-) mice, whereas co-immunoprecipitation suggested that the combinationof DCBLD2 and Cav-1 reduced the bond between Cav-1 and PDGFR-beta, and DCBLD2knock-out was able to enhance the interaction between Cav-1 and PDGFR-beta.Therefore, the current results suggest that DCBLD2 may inhibit thecaveolae-dependent endocytosis of PDGFR-beta by anchoring the receptor on thecell membrane. Based on its ability to regulate the activity of PDGFR-beta,DCBLD2 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovasculardiseases.

TI  - Signalling and responding to zoonotic threats using a One Health approach: adecade of the Zoonoses Structure in the Netherlands, 2011 to 2021.
LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.31.2200039 [doi]
AB  - In the Netherlands, the avian influenza outbreak in poultry in 2003 and the Qfever outbreak in dairy goats between 2007 and 2010 had severe consequences forpublic health. These outbreaks led to the establishment of an integratedhuman-veterinary risk analysis system for zoonoses, the Zoonoses Structure. Theaim of the Zoonoses Structure is to signal, assess and control emerging zoonoses that may pose a risk to animal and/or human health in an integrated One Healthapproach. The Signalling Forum Zoonoses (SO-Z), the first step of the ZoonosesStructure, is a multidisciplinary committee composed of experts from the medical,veterinary, entomology and wildlife domains. The SO-Z shares relevant signalswith professionals and has monthly meetings. Over the past 10 years (June 2011 toDecember 2021), 390 different signals of various zoonotic pathogens in animalreservoirs and humans have been assessed. Here, we describe the ZoonosesStructure with examples from signals and responses for four zoonotic events inthe Netherlands (tularaemia, Brucella canis, West Nile virus, and severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)). This may serve as an examplefor other countries on how to collaborate in a One Health approach to signal and control emerging zoonoses.

TI  - LncRNA-412.25 activates the LIF/STAT3 signaling pathway in ovarian granulosacells of Hu sheep by sponging miR-346.
PG  - e22467
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200632R [doi]
AB  - Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to regulate folliculardevelopment and reproductive disease pathogenesis, the underlying mechanisms havenot been elucidated. In this study, lncRNA expression profiling ofdifferent-sized healthy follicles from Hu sheep with different prolificacyrevealed 50 613 lncRNAs. Numerous lncRNAs were differentially expressed amongdifferent comparison groups. This study characterized one novel transcript,lncRNA-412.25 (from healthy follicles with a diameter of >5 mm), which waspredominantly expressed in the high prolificacy group and localized to thecytoplasm of granulosa cells (GCs). LncRNA-412.25 knockdown promoted andinhibited Hu sheep GC apoptosis and proliferation, respectively. Interestingly,lncRNA-412.25 could directly bind to miR-346, which can target the gene ofleukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Knockdown of lncRNA-412.25 promoted GCapoptosis by downregulating LIF expression, where this effect was attenuated bymiR-346. Moreover, the miR-346 inhibitor mitigated the lncRNA-412.25knockdown-induced downregulation of phosphorylated protein of signal transducerand activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which was validated usingimmunofluorescence analysis. Our results demonstrated that lncRNA-412.25regulates GC proliferation and apoptosis in Hu sheep by binding to miR-346 andthen activating the LIF/STAT3 pathway. These findings provide novel insights intothe mechanisms underlying prolificacy in sheep.

TI  - Evaluating the anti-arthritic potential of walnut (Juglans regia L.) in FCAinduced Sprague Dawley rats.
PG  - e14327
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14327 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune progressive disease, associated withmany pathophysiological consequences. Owing to the adverse effects and highercosts of pharmaceuticals, people are now looking for complementary andalternative remedies. In this milieu, the present study was designed to explorethe therapeutic potential of walnuts against FCA-induced arthritis in rat models.Purposely, 50 Sprague Dawley rats were housed in a well-ventilated animal roomand separated into 5 groups of 10 rats each. The rats were categorized as G0(negative control), G1 (positive control, i.e., FCA induced untreated arthriticrats), G2 (arthritic rats treated with MTX), G3 (arthritic rats treated withwalnut feed), and G4 (arthritic rats treated with walnut extract), with anefficacy trial lasting for 42 days. The physical analysis explicated that pawswelling was significantly improved by 10%-12.8% in treatment groups after theintervention when compared with positive control. Moreover, biochemical analyses revealed significantly lower levels of ESR, CRP, and RF in rats treated withwalnut-based interventions when compared to positive control. ESR values weredecreased by 62.4% and 69.92% in G3 and G4 , whereas CRP levels were improved by 56.20% and 77.78% in G3 and G4 when compared with G1 . Likewise, RF valuesdecreased in G2 , G3 , and G4 by 64.71%, 55.88%, and 69.24%, respectively whencompared to G1 . The histological examination demonstrated the potential role of walnut-based interventions in reducing the severity of disease by decreasing cellinfiltration, bone erosion, and paw inflammation. Meanwhile, the gene expression analysis revealed that walnut-based interventions protected the paw joints fromdamage by downregulating the RANKL-OPG pathway. Conclusively, walnut feed andextract may serve as potent anti-arthritic interventions with no side effects.PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Plant-based therapeutics are effective in the prevention and management of various chronic diseases. The current research explored theanti-arthritic potential of walnuts. Walnut feed and extract effectively reduced the serum arthritic biomarkers as well as downregulated the genes involved inbone destruction. Thus, the inclusion of dietary ingredients having therapeuticpotential such as walnuts may be synchronized in clinical practices to amelioratearthritis.

TI  - Effect of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) on cyathostomin eggs excretion, larvaldevelopment, larval community structure and efficacy of ivermectin treatment inhorses.

AB  - Alternative strategies to chemical anthelmintics are needed for the sustainablecontrol of equine strongylids. Bioactive forages like sainfoin (Onobrychisviciifolia) could contribute to reducing drug use, with the first hints of invitro activity against cyathostomin free-living stages observed in the past. Weanalysed the effect of a sainfoin-rich diet on cyathostomin population and theefficacy of oral ivermectin treatment. Two groups of 10 naturally infected horseswere enrolled in a 78-day experimental trial. Following a 1-week adaptationperiod, they were either fed with dehydrated sainfoin pellets (70% of their diet dry matter) or with alfalfa pellets (control group) for 21-days. No differencewas found between the average fecal egg counts (FECs) of the two groups, but asignificantly lower increase in larval development rate was observed for thesainfoin group, at the end of the trial. Quantification of cyathostomin speciesabundances with an ITS-2-based metabarcoding approach revealed that the sainfoin diet did not affect the nemabiome structure compared to the control diet.Following oral ivermectin treatment of all horses on day 21, the drugconcentration was lower in horses fed with sainfoin, and cyathostomin eggsreappeared earlier in that group. Our results demonstrated that short-termconsumption of a sainfoin-rich diet does not decrease cyathostomin FEC but seems to slightly reduce larval development. Consumption of dehydrated sainfoin pelletsalso negatively affected ivermectin pharmacokinetics, underscoring the need tomonitor horse feeding regimes when assessing ivermectin efficacy in the field.

AB  - The clinical acceleration of skin autogenous healing remains a great challenge,especially in the early stage after injury. In this work, a novel directlyinjectable hydrogel with high self-adaptability is designed as a provisionalmatrix to close the apposition of wound edges, using carboxymethyl cellulose and poly (gamma-glutamic acid) through Schiff-base reaction. Benefiting from thedynamic covalent cross-linking structure, the functional biodegradable hydrogels are easy to prepare (gel time 5-180 s), demonstrating adequate mechanicalstrength (40-120 kPa), anti-fatigue abilities, and rapid self-healing (5-10 minat skin defect). Furthermore, the hydrogels exhibit biocompatibility andproliferation-promoting activity with murine fibroblasts. In the full-thicknessdermal animal models, it significantly promoted collagen deposition,skin-function restoration, and VEGF expression. This hydrogel shows potential as a dressing available for skin regeneration during the healing of dermal injuries.

AB  - Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) have attracted substantial attention innumerous fields due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, theirnanotoxicity and potential for use in biomedicine still require further study. Inthis work, the effects of GOQD and trans- 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA)cotreatment on the immune function of macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) wereinvestigated. In particular, LC/MS-based metabolomics was performed to evaluatethe effects of GOQDs on the metabolism of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Herein, we fabricated GOQDs with good dispersibility and a uniform size distribution ofapproximately 7 nm using a polyimide-pyrolyzed carbon film as the workingelectrode, a high-voltage graphite electrode as the cathode, and H2O2 as theoxidant. The GOQDs entered the macrophages and emitted green fluorescence underUV irradiation. Cotreatment with GOQDs and 10-HDA induced RAW 264.7 cellproliferation. GOQDs promoted the anti-inflammatory effect of 10-HDA onLPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and attenuated the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6,and IL-1beta. The metabolites in RAW264.7 cells treated with GOQDs weresignificantly different from those in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS. Theenrichment analysis showed that treatment with GOQDs interfered with amino acidmetabolism, and lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrate the role of GOQDs inmacrophages and provide a basis for their further application in biomedicalfields.

AB  - Programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 signaling has been exploitedto design inhibitors that deliver promising clinical outcome albeit with limited efficacy. Herein, we prepare graphene oxide (GO)-PEI-PEG with low cytotoxicityand long stability and GO-PEI-PEG delivers PD-L1 siRNAs to hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) cells by the endocytosis-lysosome pathway. The functionalGO-PEI-PEG/PD-L1 siRNAs decrease PD-L1 and PD-1 abundance, increasepro-inflammation cytokine IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha release, and improve theproliferation activity of Jurkat T cells. Since GO-PEI-PEG targets the mouseliver effectively, the intrahepatic tumors in C57BL/6 mice are treated withGO-PEI-PEG/Pd-l1 siRNAs via the tail vein, resulting in shrinkage of the HCCtumors and boosting the anti-tumor efficacy in combination with oral sorafenib. Asingle treatment improves the total CD3(+) and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cellinfiltration in the HCC tumor tissues and even spleen and upregulates theexpression of Perforin, Gzmb, Ifng, Il-1b and Tnfa in the tumors after thecombined treatment. Both the single and combined treatments enhance reactiveoxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and improved HCC ferroptosis. The resultssuggest that GO-PEI-PEG delivered PD-L1 siRNAs combined with oral sorafenib canactivate the adaptive immunity and tumor ferroptosis and reveal an effectivetherapy to treat advanced HCC patients.

AB  - Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have gained significant growing attention in therecent past due to their peculiar characteristics including smaller size, highsurface area, photoluminescence, chemical stability, facile synthesis andfunctionalization possibilities. They are carbon nanostructures having less than 10 nm size with fluorescent properties. In recent years, the scientific communityis curiously adopting biomass precursors for the preparation of CQDs over thechemical compounds. These biomass sources are sustainable, eco-friendly,inexpensive, widely available and convert waste into valuable materials. Hence inour work the fundamental understating of diverse fabrication methodologies ofCQDs, and the types of raw materials employed in recent times, are all examinedand correlated comprehensively. Their unique combination of remarkableproperties, together with the ease with which they can be fabricated, makes CQDs as promising materials for applications in diverse biomedical fields, inparticular for bio-imaging, targeted drug delivery and phototherapy for cancertreatment. The mechanism for luminescence is of considerable significance forleading the synthesis of CQDs with tunable fluorescence emission. Therefore, itis aimed to explore and provide an updated review on (i) the recent progress onthe different synthesis methods of biomass-derived CQDs, (ii) the contribution ofsurface states or functional groups on the luminescence origin and (iii) itspotential application for cancer theranostics, concentrating on theirfluorescence properties. Finally, we explored the challenges in modification for the synthesis of CQDs from biomass derivatives and the future scope of CQDs inphototherapy for cancer theranostics.

AB  - Healing of injured tendon is a major clinical challenge in orthopaedic medicine, due to the poor regenerative potential of this tissue. Two-dimensionalnanomaterials, as versatile scaffolds, have shown a great potential to support,trigger and accelerate the tendon regeneration. However, weak mechanicalproperties, poor functionality and low biocompatibility of these scaffolds aswell as post-surgery infections are main drawbacks that limit their developmentin the higher clinical phases. In this work, a series of hydrogels consistingpolyglycerol functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PG),polyglycerol-functionalized molybdenum disulfide (PMoS2) and PG/PMoS2 hybridwithin the gelatin matrix are formulated in new scaffolds and their ability forthe healing of injured Achilles tendon, due to their high mechanical properties, low toxicity, cell proliferation enhancement, and antibacterial activities isinvestigated. While scaffolds containing PG and PMoS2 showed a moderate tendonregeneration and anti-inflammatory effect, respectively, their hybridization intoPG/PMoS2 demonstrated a synergistic healing efficiency. Along the same line, anaccelerated return of tendon function with low peritendinous adhesion and lowcross-sectional area in animal group treated with scaffold containing PG/PMoS2was observed. Taking advantage of the high biocompatibility, high strength,straightforward construction and fast tendon regeneration, PG/PMoS2 can be usedas a new scaffold for the future tissue engineering.

AB  - Concave surfaces have shown to promote bone regeneration in vivo. However, bonescaffolds obtained by direct ink writing, one of the most promising approachesfor the fabrication of personalized bone grafts, consist mostly of convexsurfaces, since they are obtained by microextrusion of cylindrical strands. Bymodifying the geometry of the nozzle, it is possible to print 3D structurescomposed of non-cylindrical strands and favor the presence of concave surfaces.In this work, we compare the in vivo performance of 3D-printed calcium phosphate scaffolds with either conventional cylindrical strands or star-shaped strands, ina rabbit femoral condyle model. Monocortical defects, drilled in contralateralpositions, are randomly grafted with the two scaffold configurations, withidentical composition. The samples are explanted eight weeks post-surgery andassessed by mu-CT and resin-embedded histological observations. The resultsreveal that the scaffolds containing star-shaped strands have betterosteoconductive properties, guiding the newly formed bone faster towards the coreof the scaffolds, and enhance bone regeneration, although the increase is notstatistically significant (p > 0.05). This new approach represents a turningpoint towards the optimization of pore shape in 3D-printed bone grafts, furtherboosting the possibilities that direct ink writing technology offers forpatient-specific applications.

AB  - Decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) has been widely used for wound healing.But, ECM failed to integrate tissue and restore the tissue function properly,when elevated levels of free radicals and biofilm formation occur at the woundsite. Here, nanoemulgel systems were fabricated, considering the combinatorialapproach of nanotechnology (nanoceria and curcumin nanoemulsion) and ECM gel ofgoat small intestine submucosa. The curcumin was encapsulated in the nanoemulgel system to enhance bioavailability in terms of antibacterial, antioxidant,sustained release and permeation at the wound site. Nanoceria was alsoincorporated to enhance the antibacterial, antioxidant and wound healingproperties of the fabricated nanoemulgel formulation. All the formulations wereporous, hydrophilic, biodegradable, antioxidant, antibacterial, hemocompatible,biocompatible, and showed enhanced wound healing rate. The formulation(DG-SIS/Ce/NC) showed the highest free radicals scavenging capacity andantibacterial property with prolonged curcumin release (62.9% in 96 h), skinpermeability (79.7% in 96 h); showed better cell growth under normal andoxidative-stressed conditions: it also showed full-thickness wound contraction(97.33% in 14 days) with highest collagen synthesis at the wound site (1.61mug/mg in 14 days). The outcomes of this study suggested that the formulation(DG-SIS/Ce/NC) can be a potential nanoemulgel system for full-thickness woundhealing application.

TI  - Effect of Titrated Exposure to Non-Traumatic Noise on Unvoiced Speech Recognitionin Human Listeners with Normal Audiological Profiles.

AB  - Non-traumatic noise exposure has been shown in animal models to impact theprocessing of envelope cues. However, evidence in human studies has beenconflicting, possibly because the measures have not been specificallyparameterized based on listeners' exposure profiles. The current study examinedyoung dental-school students, whose exposure to high-frequency non-traumaticdental-drill noise during their course of study is systematic and preciselyquantifiable. Twenty-five dental students and twenty-seven non-dentalparticipants were recruited. The listeners were asked to recognize unvoicedsentences that were processed to contain only envelope cues useful forrecognition and have been filtered to frequency regions inside or outside thedental noise spectrum. The sentences were presented either in quiet or in one of the noise maskers, including a steady-state noise, a 16-Hz or 32-Hz temporallymodulated noise, or a spectrally modulated noise. The dental students showed nodifference from the control group in demographic information, audiologicalscreening outcomes, extended high-frequency thresholds, or unvoiced speech inquiet, but consistently performed more poorly for unvoiced speech recognition in modulated noise. The group difference in noise depended on the filteringconditions. The dental group's degraded performances were observed in temporally modulated noise for high-pass filtered condition only and in spectrally modulatednoise for low-pass filtered condition only. The current findings provide the mostdirect evidence to date of a link between non-traumatic noise exposure andsupra-threshold envelope processing issues in human listeners despite the normal audiological profiles.

AB  - AIM: Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) was developed inthe 1990s. We developed a new moldable and compression-resistant matrix (CRM)carrier. We conducted an animal experimental study to evaluate the safety andefficacy of the CRM carrier for rhBMP-2 in osteogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS:New moldable CRM carrier, and with rhBMP-2 (new CRM carrier with rhBMP-2) wereprepared as the experimental groups. Pre-existing synthetic bone graft materialwas prepared as a control graft group. A total of 24 rabbits were included in thestudy. Defects were made and grafts were performed, and radiographic andhistopathologic findings were evaluated to assess fusion. RESULTS: In thecomputed tomographic scan, new bone formation was superior in 16.0%, 39.3%,64.7%, and 81.1% of the total defect volume at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks in the new CRM carrier with rhBMP-2 group. In the new CRM carrier group, new bone formation was observed in 10.6%, 26.3%, 53.1%, and 71.4%, respectively. In the controlgraft group, new bone formation was observed in 10.1%, 26.6%, 53.4%, and 72.1%,respectively. On histopathologic evaluation, new CRM carrier with rhBMP-2 groupshowed better new bone formation compared with those of other groups. CONCLUSION:The new moldable CRM carrier and the CRM carrier with rhBMP-2 showed preclinical safety and efficacy in new bone formation. In particular, the CRM carrier withrhBMP-2 was considered to be an effective bone graft material for bone fusion.

TI  - Wood-Derived Vascular Patches Loaded With Rapamycin Inhibit NeointimalHyperplasia.
PG  - 933505
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.933505 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patches are commonly used to close blood vessels after vascularsurgery. Most currently used materials are either prosthetics or animal-derived; although natural materials, such as a leaf, can be used as a patch, healing ofthese natural materials is not optimal; rhodamine and rapamycin have been used toshow that coating patches with drugs allow drug delivery to inhibit neointimalhyperplasia that may improve patch healing. Wood is abundant, and its stiffnesscan be reduced with processing; however, whether wood can be used as a vascularpatch is not established. We hypothesized that wood can be used as a vascularpatch and thus may serve as a novel plant-based biocompatible material. Method:Male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 6-8 weeks) were used as an inferior vena cava(IVC) patch venoplasty model. After softening, wood patches coated with rhodamineand rapamycin were implanted into the rat subcutaneous tissue, the abdominalcavity, or the IVC. Samples were explanted on day 14 for analysis. Result: Woodpatches became soft after processing. Patches showed biocompatibility afterimplantation into the subcutaneous tissue or the abdominal cavity. Afterimplantation into the IVC, the patches retained mechanical strength. There was a significantly thinner neointima in wood patches coated with rapamycin thancontrol patches (146.7 +/- 15.32 mum vs. 524.7 +/- 26.81 mum; p = 0.0001). There were CD34 and nestin-positive cells throughout the patch, and neointimalendothelial cells were Eph-B4 and COUP-TFII-positive. There was a significantlysmaller number of PCNA and alpha-actin dual-positive cells in the neointima (p = 0.0003), peri-patch area (p = 0.0198), and adventitia (p = 0.0004) in woodpatches coated with rapamycin than control patches. Piezo1 was expressed in theneointima and peri-patch area, and there were decreased CD68 and piezo1dual-positive cells in wood patches coated with rapamycin compared to controlpatches. Conclusion: Wood can be used as a novel biomaterial that can beimplanted as a vascular patch and also serve as a scaffold for drug delivery.Plant-derived materials may be an alternative to prosthetics or animal-basedmaterials in vascular applications.

AB  - Mark-release-recapture (MRR) trials have been conducted in Northern Italy toevaluate the capacity of radio-substerilized Aedes albopictus males to survive,disperse, and engage in mating in the field. Two MRR sessions with the humanlanding collection method (HLC) were conducted with the simultaneous release ofirradiated males marked with four different pigment colors. The survival anddispersal rates seem to be influenced more by environmental factors such asbarriers, shading, and vegetation rather than weather parameters. In this study, we confirmed a positive linear relationship between the sterile adult male'sdaily survival rate and the relative humidity previously reported in similarexperimental conditions and a different dispersal capacity of the released A.albopictus males in low- (NDVI index <0.4) and high (NDVI index >0.4)-vegetatedareas. Consistent with previous studies, A. albopictus males have their maximaldispersion in the first days after release, while in the following days the malesbecome more stationary. The similar field performances obtained with marked andunmarked radio-sterilized and untreated A. albopictus males on similarenvironments confirm the negligible effects of irradiation and marking procedureson the quality of the males released. The similar sterile to wild (S/W) maleratio measured in high- and low-vegetation areas in the release sites indicates asimilar distribution pattern for the wild and the released sterile males.According to the MRR data collected, the Lincoln index estimated different A.albopictus mean population densities in the study areas equal to 7,000 and 3,000 male/ha, respectively.

AB  - Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IVDD) has been considered the dominantfactor in low back pain (LBP), and its etiological mechanisms are complex and notyet fully elucidated. To date, the treatment of IVDD has mainly focused onrelieving clinical symptoms and cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Recently,a novel microsphere-based therapeutic strategy has held promise for IVDregeneration and has yielded encouraging results with in vitro experiments andanimal models. With excellent injectability, biocompatibility, andbiodegradability, this microsphere carrier allows for targeted delivery andcontrolled release of drugs, gene regulatory sequences, and other bioactivesubstances and supports cell implantation and directed differentiation, aiming toimprove the disease state of IVD at the source. This review discusses thepossible mechanisms of IVDD and the limitations of current therapies, focusing onthe application of microsphere delivery systems in IVDD, including targeteddelivery of active substances and drugs, cellular therapy, and gene therapy, and attempts to provide a new understanding for the treatment of IVDD.

These have evolved from simple single-cell assays toincreasingly complex models with integrated dermal equivalents and multiple cell types including a dermis, epidermis, and vasculature. The development ofmicro-engineered platforms and biomaterials has enabled scientists to betterrecreate and capture the tissue microenvironment in vitro, including thevascularization of tissue models and their integration into microfluidic chips.However, to date, microvascularized human skin equivalents in a microfluidiccontext have not been reported. Here, we present the design of a novelskin-on-a-chip model integrating human-derived primary and immortalized cells in a full-thickness skin equivalent. The model is housed in a microfluidic device,in which a microvasculature was previously established. We characterize theimpact of our chip design on the quality of the microvascular networks formed andevidence that this enables the formation of more homogenous networks. Wedeveloped a methodology to harvest tissues from embedded chips, after 14 days of culture, and characterize the impact of culture conditions and vascularization(including with pericyte co-cultures) on the stratification of the epidermis inthe resulting skin equivalents. Our results indicate that vascularizationenhances stratification and differentiation (thickness, architecture, andexpression of terminal differentiation markers such as involucrin andtransglutaminase 1), allowing the formation of more mature skin equivalents inmicrofluidic chips. The skin-on-a-chip tissue equivalents developed, because oftheir realistic microvasculature, may find applications for testing efficacy and safety of therapeutics delivered systemically, in a human context.

AB  - Despite the advancement in research methodologies and technologies for cancerresearch, there is a high rate of anti-cancer drug attrition. In this review, we discuss different conventional and modern approaches in cancer research and howhuman-centric models can improve on the voids conferred by more traditionalanimal-centric models, thereby offering a more reliable platform for drugdiscovery. Advanced three-dimensional cell culture methodologies, along with insilico computational analysis form the core of human-centric cancer research.This can provide a holistic understanding of the research problems and helpdesign specific and accurate experiments that could lead to the development ofbetter cancer therapeutics. Here, we propose a new human-centric research roadmapthat promises to provide a better platform for cancer research and drugdiscovery.

AB  - Autoclaving-cooling is a common starch modification method to increase theresistant starch (RS) content. The effect of this method varies depending on the type of crop and treatment condition used. The objectives of this study were toverify the autoclaving-cooling treatment based on a meta-analysis result and toevaluate the physicochemical properties of modified starches. The meta-analysisstudy used 10 articles from a total of 1,293 that were retrieved using the PRISMAapproach. Meta-analysis showed that the optimal treatments of autoclaving-coolingprocess that increase the RS content significantly, was in starch samples fromthe cereal group (corn, oats, rice) (SMD: 19.60; 95% CI: 9.56-29.64; p < 0.001), with water ratio 1:4 (SMD: 13.69; 95% CI: 5.50-21.87; p < 0.001), using twocycles of autoclaving-cooling (SMD: 16.33; 95% CI: 6.98-25.67; p < 0.001) and 30 min of autoclaving heating (SMD: 12.97; 95% CI: 1.97-23.97; p < 0.001) at 121degrees C (SMD: 12.18; 95% CI: 1.88-22.47; p < 0.001). Verification using cornflour and corn starch showed a significant increase in RS contents from 15.84 to 27.78% and from 15.27 to 32.53%, respectively, and a significant decrease instarch digestibility from 67.02 to 35.74% and from 76.15 to 28.09%, respectively.Treated sample also showed the pasting profile that was stable under heating and stirring.

AB  - Early life is a vital period for mammals to be colonized with the microbiome,which profoundly influences the development of the intestinal immune function.For neonates to resist pathogen infection and avoid gastrointestinal illness, theintestinal innate immune system is critical. Thus, this review summarizes thedevelopment of the intestinal microbiome and the intestinal innate immunebarrier, including the intestinal epithelium and immune cells from the fetal tothe weaning period. Moreover, the impact of the intestinal microbiome on innateimmune development and the two main way of early-life intervention includingprobiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) also are discussed in this review. We hope to highlight the crosstalk between early microbial colonizationand intestinal innate immunity development and offer some information for earlyintervention.

AB  - The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway is an important innate immune signaling cascaderesponsible for the sensing of abnormal cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA),which is a hallmark of infection or cancers. Recently, tremendous progress hasbeen made in the understanding of the STING activation mechanism from variousaspects. In this review, the molecular mechanism of activation of STING proteinbased on its structural features is briefly discussed. The underlying molecularmechanism of STING activation will enable us to develop novel therapeutics totreat STING-associated diseases and understand how STING has evolved to eliminateinfection and maintain immune homeostasis in innate immunity.

AB  - Brucellosis, caused by Brucella spp., is one of the most widespread bacterialzoonoses worldwide. Vaccination is still considered the best way to controlbrucellosis. An investigation into the differential proteome expression patterns of wild and vaccine strains may help researchers and clinicians differentiatebetween the strains to diagnose and better understand the mechanism(s) underlyingdifferences in virulence. In the present study, a mass spectrometry-based,label-free relative quantitative proteomics approach was used to investigate the proteins expressed by the wild strain, B. melitensis biovar 3 and compare it withthose expressed by B. melitensis M5-90. The higher level of virulence for B.melitensis biovar 3 compared to B. melitensis M5-90 was validated in vitro and invivo. A total of 2133 proteins, encompassing 68% of the theoretical proteome,were identified and quantified by proteomic analysis, resulting in broad coverageof the B. melitensis proteome. A total of 147 proteins were identified asdifferentially expressed (DE) between these two strains. In addition, 9 proteins and 30 proteins were identified as unique to B. melitensis M5-90 and B.melitensis biovar 3, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that the majority ofthe DE proteins were involved in iron uptake, quorum sensing, pyrimidinemetabolism, glycine betaine biosynthetic and metabolic processes,thiamine-containing compound metabolism and ABC transporters. The expression ofBtpA and VjbR proteins (two well-known virulence factors) in B. melitensis biovar3 was 8-fold and 2-fold higher than in B. melitensis M5-90. In summary, ourresults identified many unique proteins that could be selected as candidatemarkers for differentiating vaccinated animals from animals with wild-typeinfections. BtpA and VjbR proteins might be responsible for the residualvirulence of B. melitensis M5-90, while ABC transporters and thiamine metabolism associated proteins may be newly identified Brucella virulence factors. All ofthe identified DE proteins provide valuable information for the development ofvaccines and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is one of the most important food fish inthe world. However, the farming industry has encountered significant challenges, such as pathogen infections. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an essential role inthe initiation of the innate immune system against pathogens. Sterile alpha andTIR motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1) is one of the most evolutionarilyconserved TLR adaptors, and its orthologs are present in various species fromworms to humans. SARM1 plays an important role in negatively regulating TIRdomain-containing adaptor proteins inducing IFNbeta (TRIF)-dependent TLRsignaling in mammals, but its immune function remains poorly understood in fish. In this study, O. niloticus SARM1 (OnSARM1) was cloned and its evolutionarystatus was verified using bioinformatic analyses. mRNA expression of OnSARM1 was found at a higher level in the trunk kidney and muscle in healthy fish. Theexamination of its subcellular location showed that the OnSARM1 was detected onlyin the cytoplasm of THK cells, and colocalized with OnMyD88, OnTRIF and OnTRIF insmall speckle-like condensed granules. The transcript levels of OnMyD88, OnTIRAP,OnTRIF, and downstream effectors, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, IL-12b and type I interferon (IFN)d2.13, were regulated conversely to the expression of OnSARM1 in the head kidney from Aeromonas hydrophila and Streptococcus agalactiaeinfected fish. Moreover, the treatment of THK cells with lysates from A.hydrophila and S. agalactiae enhanced the activity of the NF-kappaB promoter, butthe effects were inhibited in the OnSARM1 overexpressed THK cells. Overexpressionof OnSARM1 alone did not activate the NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter, but itsuppressed OnMyD88- and OnTIRAP-mediated NF-kappaB promoter activity.Additionally, OnSARM1 inhibited the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and hepcidin in A. hydrophila lysate stimulated THK cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that OnSARM1 serves as a negative regulator by inhibitingNF-kappaB activity, thereby influencing the transcript level of proinflammatorycytokines and antimicrobial peptides in the antibacterial responses.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumours in the worldand seriously affects health of men. Studies have shown that microRNA(miR)-29b-3p and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activationprotein epsilon (YWHAE) play important roles in influencing the proliferation andapoptosis of PCa cells. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-29b-3p and YWHAE in the proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cells remains unclear. In the presentstudy, bioinformatics as well as in vivo and in vitro experiments were used topredict and verify the targeting relationship between YWHAE and mir-29B-3p andinvestigate the potential roles of YWHAE and mir-29b-3p in the proliferation and apoptosis of 22RV1 cells. Using bioinformatics and a double luciferase systemassay, it was confirmed that miR-29b-3p can target YWHAE 3'untranslated regionand affect the expression of YWHAE, suggesting that miR-29b-3p may be a potentialmiRNA of YWHAE. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, Cell Counting Kit-8,Transwell and cell scratch assays showed that miR-29b-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of 22Rv1 cells (P<0.01). Rescueexperiments demonstrated that YWHAE gene introduction reversed the inhibitoryeffect of miR-29b-3p on 22Rv1 cells. Western blotting revealed that theupregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited YWHAE expression, resulting in a verysignificant decrease in the ratio of p-BAD/BAD and full-length caspase 3/cleaved caspase 3 (P<0.01) and an extremely significant increase in the ratio ofBAX/BCL-2 (P<0.01). A tumourigenesis test in nude mice in vivo confirmed that theupregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited tumour growth by targeting YWHAE. Thepresent experiments confirmed that miR-29b-3p plays a tumour suppressor role in22Rv1 PCa cells, and the YWHAE/BCL-2 regulatory axis plays a vital role inmiR-29b-3p regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of 22Rv1 cells. Theseresults may provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of PCa.

AB  - To establish a mouse model of weak depression, we raised 6-week-old C57BL/6N micein single (SH) or group housing (GH) conditions for 2 weeks. The SH group showed less social interaction with stranger mice, learning disability in behavioraltests, and lower plasma corticosterone levels. The cecal microbiota of the SHgroup showed significant segregation from the GH group in the principalcoordinate analysis (PCoA). Transcriptome analysis of the amygdala and liverdetected multiple differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In the amygdala of SHmice, suppression of the cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP) signal was predictedand confirmed by the reduced immunoreactivity of phosphorylated cAMP-responsiveelement-binding protein. In the liver of SH mice, downregulation ofbeta-oxidation was predicted. Interestingly, the expression levels of over 100DEGs showed a significant correlation with the occupancy of two bacterial genera,Lactobacillus (Lactobacillaceae) and Anaerostipes (Lachnospiraceae). Thesebacteria-correlated DEGs included JunB, the downstream component of cAMPsignaling in the amygdala, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a), a keyenzyme of beta-oxidation in the liver. This trans-omical analysis also suggested that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis in the liver may be linkedto the occupancy of Lactobacillus through the regulation of nicotinamidephosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and kynureninase (KYNU) genes. Our resultssuggested that SH condition along with the presence of correlated bacteriaspecies causes weak depression phenotype in young mice and provides a suitablemodel to study food ingredient that is able to cure weak depression.

PG  - 527
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-5695 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objective: As the vascular theory has led many researchers tofocus on vascular dysfunction in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, a betterunderstanding of ocular microcirculation would be of great significance. Theemergence of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has shed light onthe various fundus microvascular changes that occur in glaucoma, thus providingample evidence in the role of microvascular dysfunction in glaucoma. The aim ofthis review is to provide an overview of the retinal and choroidal microvascular alterations that occur in glaucoma and to address the role of microvascularalterations in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of glaucoma.Methods: The literature regarding fundus microvascular alterations in glaucomaand after glaucoma treatment, including alterations of vascular perfusion andvascular reactivity, was broadly researched using PubMed and Web of Sciencedatabases. The endothelium involvements during the glaucoma course were alsosearched in the databases broadly. Key Content and Findings: Previous OCTAstudies show vessel density (VD) decreases in the retinal macular andperipapillary regions and choroidal microvascular dropout. Such microvascularalterations are correlated with structural and functional defects and havepotential value for the early diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma. Retinalmicrovascular autoregulation is also impaired in glaucomatous eyes. Furthermore, various studies have demonstrated the role of the vascular endothelium inglaucoma. Different topical medications and surgical interventions have beenshown to have an impact on microvasculature in glaucoma, and animal experimentshave indicated the endothelial system may be a new target in glaucoma treatment. Conclusions: Ample evidence proved the involvement of retinal and choroidalmicrovascular structural and functional changes in the course of glaucoma. Thisreview makes a novel contribution to the literature by summarizing themicrovascular alterations in glaucoma eyes and the microvascular changes aftertopical or surgical treatments.

PG  - 515
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-4984 [doi]
AB  - Background: Head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HU-CPR) is an experimentaltreatment for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), where cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) is performed in a ramped position. We evaluated whether HU-CPR improvedsurvival and surrogate outcomes as compared to standard CPR (S-CPR). Methods:Studies reporting on HU-CPR in SCA were searched for in PubMed, Embase andCochrane Library from inception to May 1st 2021. Outcomes includedneurologically-intact survival, 24-hour-survival, intracranial pressure (ICP),cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) and brain blood flow (BBF). Risk of bias was assessed using the GRADE assessment tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Fixed- andrandom-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effects of HU-CPR at 30degrees. Results: Thirteen articles met the criteria for inclusion (11animal-only studies, one before-and-after human-only study, one study thatutilized human- and animal-cadavers). Among animal studies, the most commonimplementation of HU-CPR was a 30-degree upward tilt of the head and thorax(n=7), while four studies investigated controlled sequential elevation (CSE). Twoanimal studies reported improved cerebral performance category (CPC) scores at24-hour. The pooled effect on 24-hour survival was not statistically significant (P=0.37). The lone human study reported doubled return of spontaneous circulation(ROSC) (17.9% versus 34.2%, P<0.0001). The pooled effect on ROSC in three porcinestudies was OR =3.63 (95% CI: 0.72-18.39). Pooled effects for surrogatephysiological outcomes of intracranial cranial pressure (MD -14.08, 95% CI:-23.21 to -4.95, P=0.003), CerPP (MD 14.39, 95% CI: 3.07-25.72, P=0.01) and BBF(MD 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-0.27, P=0.03), showed statistically significant benefit.Discussion: Overall, HU-CPR improved neurologically-intact survival at 24-hour,ROSC and physiological surrogate outcomes in animal models. Despite promisingpreclinical data, and one human observational study, clinical equipoise remainssurrounding the role of HU-CPR in SCA, necessitating clarification with futurerandomized human trials.

PG  - 1424-1430
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00673-w [doi]
AB  - Background/Aim: Denosumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 antibodydeveloped from the ovarian cells of Chinese hamsters. We aimed tohistomorphometrically and radiologically evaluate the effects of xenografts used with local denosumab on the healing of defect sites using rabbit skulls.Materials and Methods: Two 10-mm diameter critical-size defects were created in16 rabbits. The defect areas were filled with xenografts and xenograft + 3 mgdenosumab in the control and denosumab groups (DEN), respectively. We evaluatednew bone, residual graft, soft tissue areas, and bone volume in 4- and 8-weekstudy groups. Results: Histomorphometrically, there were no statisticallysignificant differences between groups at both 4 and 8 weeks regarding residualgraft, new bone, and soft tissue area (p > 0.05). The 4-week residual graftcontrol group values were significantly higher than the 8-week values (p < 0.05).The soft tissue area was significantly greater in the 4-week compared with the8-week DEN group (p < 0.05). The radiologically measured total bone volume wassignificantly greater in the 8-week specimens than in the 4-week specimens (p <0.05). Conclusion: In this study, denosumab used locally with bone grafts, showedno direct effect on new and total bone volume.

TI  - Outcome Analysis of Osseous Ingrowth in an Artificially Created Gap Non-unionUsing the Novel 3D Biodegradable Polycaprolactone Poly-l-Lactide PolymerScaffold: Insights from an Experimental Study.
PG  - 1410-1416
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00657-w [doi]
AB  - Background: Synthetic biopolymers have been widely used to manage bone effects inrecent years. The study aims to analyse the ability to repair artificiallycreated ulnar bone defects with the scaffold made of Polycaprolactone (PCL) andinvestigate the material's feasibility as a bone graft substitute. Method: Wehave tested a novel 3D biodegradable Polycaprolactone Poly-l-Lactide polymerscaffold in an experimental animal model. 14 adults New Zealand white rabbitswere used to create the ulnar defect model of 10 mm in length, and randomlydivided into group A (test-12 rabbits), group B (control-3 rabbits). The defectarea was implanted with the PCL scaffold in the test group, whereas it was leftas such in the control group. The repairing effect was observed by gross,histology, radiology, and the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Cook's scoring was used to assess the radiological parameters. Results:Histological and radiological results showed better quality of bone regeneration in the defect area at 12 week follow-up period. The SEM image at that periodshowed impregnation of the osteogenic cells in the surface and pores of thescaffold material. It was evident that the scaffold was thoroughly degraded,corresponding with osteogenesis. New bone formation was statistically significantin the test group than in the control group. Conclusion: The PolycaprolactonePoly-l-Lactide polymer scaffold is biodegradable in-vivo at a suitable half-life.It has an excellent porous structure, no tissue toxicity, excellent mechanicalstrength, high osteogenesis potential, and osteoconductivity. Therefore, it canbe used as bone graft material in the gap non-union and as a void filler in bone defects.

AB  - Background: Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP)infections in companion animals are increasing and are difficult to treat.Environmental contamination with MRSP in small animal primary care hospitals may pose an exposure risk to animal patients. Methods: This longitudinal studyassessed the genotypic relationships of MRSP isolated from 39 environmentalsamples collected from six private small animal primary care hospitals, in thenorth-eastern United States, between August 2018 and April 2019. Results: Of the 39 bacterial isolates, 18 unique pulsotypes were identified based on pulsed-fieldgel electrophoresis, including six clusters of two or more indistinguishableisolates. Single pulsotypes were frequently detected from multiple hand-contactand animal-contact surfaces within a hospital during a single sampling event, butdetection of a single pulsotype within the same hospital on subsequent visits wasinfrequent. However, one pulsotype was recovered from three separate hospitals,which suggests that either MRSP transmission between hospitals may have occurred via people, animals, or fomites or that there was a dominant community strain.Conclusions: Single strains of MRSP were isolated from various hand-contact andanimal-contact surfaces within hospitals, indicating the important role ofhumans, animals and the environment in MRSP transmission. Additionally, thedetection of a single strain between hospitals and over time suggests that eitherMRSP transmission between hospitals may have occurred via people, animals orfomites or that there was a dominant community strain.

TI  - Alteration of the Oligodendrocyte Lineage Varies According to the SystemicInflammatory Stimulus in Animal Models That Mimic the Encephalopathy ofPrematurity.
PG  - 881674
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.881674 [doi]
AB  - Preterm birth before the gestational age of 32 weeks is associated with theoccurrence of specific white matter damage (WMD) that can compromise theneurological outcome. These white matter abnormalities are embedded in moreglobal brain damage defining the encephalopathy of prematurity (EoP). A globalreduction in white matter volume that corresponds to chronic diffuse WMD is themost frequent form in contemporary cohorts of very preterm infants. This WMDpartly results from alterations of the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage during thevulnerability window preceding the beginning of brain myelination. The occurrenceof prenatal, perinatal and postnatal events in addition to preterm birth isrelated to the intensity of WMD. Systemic inflammation is widely recognised as a risk factor of WMD in humans and in animal models. This review reports the OLlineage alterations associated with the WMD observed in infants suffering fromEoP and emphasizes the role of systemic inflammation in inducing thesealterations. This issue is addressed through data on human tissue and imaging,and through neonatal animal models that use systemic inflammation to induce WMD. Interestingly, the OL lineage damage varies according to the inflammatorystimulus, i.e., the liposaccharide portion of the E.Coli membrane (LPS) or theproinflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). This discrepancy revealsmultiple cellular pathways inducible by inflammation that result in EoP. Variablelong-term consequences on the white matter morphology and functioning may bespeculated upon according to the intensity of the inflammatory challenge. Thishypothesis emerges from this review and requires further exploration.

TI  - Raman enhancement effect of different silver nanoparticles on salbutamol.
PG  - e09576
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09576 [doi]
AB  - Salbutamol is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist compound which has been abusedas an animal growth promoter to improve carcass lean meat percentage. At present,the detection of salbutamol by SERS mostly uses gold colloid as substrate, which is expensive and has a high detection limit. In this report, Raman enhancementsignal of salbutamol was compared with concentrated gold and silver colloids. Theresults show that the concentrated silver colloid prepared by reducing silvernitrate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride had superior performance. Three silvercolloids with different particle sizes were synthesized by the same reducingagent and used as substrates for spectra acquisition of salbutamol to explore theenhancement performance of different silver nanoparticles sizes on salbutamol.The results showed that silver nanoparticles with larger particle sizes were moreconducive to the adsorption of salbutamol. Finally, under the optimal conditions (Silver colloid A as enhanced substrate, 0.2 mol/L NaOH aqueous solution asaggregating compound), a better linear relationship between the concentration of salbutamol (ranged from 0.2 to 1 mg/L) and SERS intensity. The linear equationbetween SERS intensity and salbutamol concentration was C = 0.0023I-0.079 (mg/L) with a good linearity (R (2) =0.994) and lower root mean square error (RMSE c =0.022 mg/L), where C (mg/L) was the concentration of salbutamol solution and Iwas the SERS intensity of salbutamol solution. Validation set correlationcoefficient was 0.988 and prediction root mean square error was 0.029 mg/L. This method provides a new idea for further reducing the detection limit ofsalbutamol. This study is helpful to further develop a simple and low-cost SERSdetection method of salbutamol based on silver colloid.

AB  - Uncovering the genetic basis of photosynthetic trait variation under droughtstress is essential for breeding climate-resilient walnut cultivars. To this end,we examined photosynthetic capacity in a diverse panel of 150 walnut families(1500 seedlings) from various agro-climatic zones in their habitats and grown in a common garden experiment. Photosynthetic traits were measured underwell-watered (WW), water-stressed (WS) and recovery (WR) conditions. We performedgenome-wide association studies (GWAS) using three genomic datasets: genotypingby sequencing data ( approximately 43 K SNPs) on both mother trees (MGBS) andprogeny (PGBS) and the Axiom Juglans regia 700 K SNP array data ( approximately295 K SNPs) on mother trees (MArray). We identified 578 unique genomic regionslinked with at least one trait in a specific treatment, 874 predicted genes that fell within 20 kb of a significant or suggestive SNP in at least two of the threeGWAS datasets (MArray, MGBS, and PGBS), and 67 genes that fell within 20 kb of a significant SNP in all three GWAS datasets. Functional annotation identifiedseveral candidate pathways and genes that play crucial roles in photosynthesis,amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, and signal transduction. Further network analysis identified 15 hub genes under WW, WS and WR conditions including GAPB,PSAN, CRR1, NTRC, DGD1, CYP38, and PETC which are involved in the photosynthetic responses. These findings shed light on possible strategies for improving walnut productivity under drought stress.

PG  - 742-746
LID - 10.25122/jml-2021-0329 [doi]
AB  - For the last decades, endometriosis has been a major gynecological problem and a significant cause of infertility for women worldwide. It is estimated that thedisease affects about 10-15% of all women of reproductive age and 70% of womensuffering from chronic pelvic pain. At the same time, the incidence is about40-60% in women with dysmenorrhea and 20-30% in women with subfertility. Despite the high percentage of affected women, endometriosis is still characterized byinsufficient knowledge of the pathogenic processes, leading to the developmentand continuity of the disease. For this reason, there is a significant need forinsight and understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis. This systematicreview aims to present the latest data on the use of rats in endometriosisresearch and to explore how fertility is affected in rats with endometriosis. Themethodology included a review of the available publications retrieved by a searchin various scientific databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and GoogleScholar. The initial search generated 30 titles, with 10 articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria. In conclusion, several surgical techniques have been proposedto induce endometriosis, mainly using rats as the appropriate animal model.Studies in rats showed that endometriosis causes infertility and that pregnancyrates are lower for rats with endometriosis than those without endometriosis. In addition, rats with endometriosis have significant abnormalities in the structureof their oocytes as well as in the development of their embryos (geneticabnormalities).

AB  - The administration of antiretrovirals (ARVs) for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis(PrEP) is highly efficacious and may benefit from new long-acting (LA) drugdelivery approaches. This paper describes a subcutaneous, reservoir-style implantfor the LA delivery of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and documents the preclinical assessment of implant safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in New Zealand White (NZW)rabbits (3 groups of n = 5), beagle dogs (2 groups of n = 6), and rhesus macaques(2 groups of n = 3). Placebo implants were placed in rabbits (n = 10) and dogs (n= 12). Implant parameters, including selection of the TAF form, choice ofexcipient, and PCL formulation were tuned to achieve targeted concentrations ofthe active anabolite of TAF, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), within peripheralblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and mucosal tissues relevant to HIV transmission.Sustained concentrations of TFV-DP in PBMCs over 100 fmol/10(6) cells wereachieved in all animal species indicating that the implants effectively deliveredTAF for 3-6 months. Unlike placebo implants without TAF, all active implantsresulted in local adverse events (AEs) proximal to the implant ranging inseverity from mild to moderate and included dermal inflammation and necrosisacross all species. Despite these AEs, the implant performed as designed andachieved a constant drug release profile, supporting the continued development ofthis drug delivery platform.

AB  - Stress is a physiological consequence of the body to adversity. The gut-brainaxis and probiotics are gaining interest to provide better treatment for stressand other neurological disorders. Probiotic (Lactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14 and Bacillus clausii, 10(10) colony-forming unit/day/animal, per oral) effects wereinvestigated in acute (up to day 7) and subacute (days 8-14) restraint-stressedand normal mice through behavioral paradigms (elevated plus maze: EPM, light darkbox/dark light box: LDB, and open field test: OFT). Time spent in the open armsof the EPM, time spent in the light compartment of the LDB, and movable time and time spent in the center of the OFT were significantly (p </= 0.05, n = 5)increased in probiotic-treated restraint-stressed mice. Enzyme-linked immunoassaydetermined blood cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, whichwere reduced significantly (p < 0.05, n = 5) in probiotic-treatedrestraint-stressed mice. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained hippocampal slides alsoshowed less or no neurodegeneration in the probiotic-treated animals.High-performance liquid chromatography and quantitative polymerase chain reactionwere performed to determine the monoamine levels and mRNA expression of dopamine receptor subtypes (D1 and D2) and synaptophysin in the mice hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels were also significantly (p < 0.05, n = 5) increased in the HC and PFC ofprobiotic-treated animal brains. Fold expression of mRNA of D1 and D2 (except HC,LF-S, day 14) receptors and synaptophysin was also significantly (p < 0.05, n =5) increased in the same brain parts of probiotic-treated restraint-stressedmice. Comparing mice in the Lactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14 and Bacillus clausii groups to mice in the normal group, only a significant (p < 0.05, n = 5) decreasewas observed in the serum ACTH and cortisol levels on day 14 in Bacillusclausii-treated mice, where all other parameters also showed improvement. Incomparison, Bacillus clausii showed greater stress suppressant activity thanLactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14. However, both probiotic bacteria can be a betterand safer therapeutic alternative for ailments than currently available drugs.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of Codonopsispilosula (Franch.) Nannf. (Codonopsis Radix, CR) and reveal the mechanism of its effects on suppressing Gastric Precancerous Lesions. Methods: First, weestablished the GPL rat model which was induced byN-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, a disordered diet, and 40% ethanol. TheCR's anti-Gastric Precancerous Lesions effect was comprehensively evaluated bybody weight, pathological section, and serum biochemical indexes. Then,quantitative proteomics and metabolomics were conducted to unveil the disturbedprotein-network and pharmacodynamic mechanism. Furthermore, serum pharmacologywas employed to confirm that CR's anti-gastritis and anti-cancer phenotype incell models. Results: In animal models, CR had been shown to control inflammationand ameliorate Gastric Precancerous Lesions. Considering the combination ofproteomics and metabolomics, we found that CR could significantly reverse thebiological pathways related to energy metabolism which were disturbed by theGastric Precancerous Lesions model. Furthermore, the results of serumpharmacology indicated that the Codonopsis Radix containing serum couldameliorate gastritis injury and selectively inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells rather than normal cells, which was closely related to ATPproduction in the above mentioned cells. Conclusion: In summary, CR exertedanti-Gastric Precancerous Lesions effects by ameliorating gastritis injury andselectively inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells rather thannormal cells. Proteomics and metabolomics unveiled that its efficacy was closely related to its regulation of the energy-metabolism pathway. This research notonly provided new ideas for exploring the mechanism of complex systems such asChinese herbals but also benefited the treatment strategy of Gastric PrecancerousLesions via regulating energy metabolism.

TI  - Assessing in vivo and in vitro biofilm development by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae using a murine model of catheter-associated biofilm and humankeratinocyte cell.
PG  - 874694

AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (SDSD) is an important agent ofbovine mastitis. This infection causes an inflammatory reaction in udder tissue, being the most important disease-causing significant impact on the dairyindustry. Therefore, it leads to an increase in dairy farming to meet commercial demands. As a result, there is a major impact on both the dairy industry and the environment including global warming. Recurrent mastitis is often attributed tothe development of bacterial biofilms, which promote survival of sessile cells inhostile environments, and resistance to the immune system defense andantimicrobial therapy. Recently, we described the in vitro biofilm development onabiotic surfaces by bovine SDSD. In that work we integrated microbiology,imaging, and computational methods to evaluate the biofilm production capability of SDSD isolates on abiotic surfaces. Additionally, we reported that bovine SDSD can adhere and internalize human cells, including human epidermal keratinocyte(HEK) cells. We showed that the adherence and internalization rates of bovineSDSD isolates in HEK cells are higher than those of a SDSD DB49998-05 isolatedfrom humans. In vivo, bovine SDSD can cause invasive infections leading tozebrafish morbidity and mortality. In the present work, we investigated for thefirst time the capability of bovine SDSD to develop biofilm in vivo using amurine animal model and ex-vivo on human HEK cells. Bovine SDSD isolates wereselected based on their ability to form weak, moderate, or strong biofilms onglass surfaces. Our results showed that SDSD isolates displayed an increasedability to form biofilms on the surface of catheters implanted in mice whencompared to in vitro biofilm formation on abiotic surface. A greater ability toform biofilm in vitro after animal passage was observed for the VSD45 isolate,but not for the other isolates tested. Besides that, in vitro scanning electronmicroscopy demonstrated that SDSD biofilm development was visible after 4 hoursof SDSD adhesion to HEK cells. Cell viability tests showed an important reductionin the number of HEK cells after the formation of SDSD biofilms. In this study,the expression of genes encoding BrpA-like (biofilm regulatory protein), FbpA(fibronectin-binding protein A), HtrA (serine protease), and SagA (streptolysin Sprecursor) was higher for biofilm grown in vivo than in vitro, suggesting apotential role for these virulence determinants in the biofilm-development, host colonization, and SDSD infections. Taken together, these results demonstrate thatSDSD can develop biofilms in vivo and on the surface of HEK cells causingimportant cellular damages. As SDSD infections are considered zoonotic diseases, our data contribute to a better understanding of the role of biofilm accumulationduring SDSD colonization and pathogenesis not only in bovine mastitis, but theyalso shed some lights on the mechanisms of prosthesis-associated infection andcellulitis caused by SDSD in humans, as well.

AB  - Decellularization of xenogeneic heart valves might lead to excellent regenerativeimplants, from which many patients could benefit. However, this material carries various xenogeneic epitopes and thus bears a considerable inherent immunological risk. Here, we investigated the regenerative and immunogenic potential ofxenogeneic decellularized heart valve implants using pigs deficient for thegalactosyltransferase gene (GGTA1-KO) as novel large animal model. Decellularizedaortic and pulmonary heart valves obtained from sheep, wild-type pigs or GGTA1-KOpigs were implanted into GGTA1-KO pigs for 3, or 6 months, respectively. Explantswere analyzed histologically, immunhistologically (CD3, CD21 and CD172a) andanti-alphaGal antibody serum titers were determined by ELISA. Xenogeneic sheepderived implants exhibited a strong immune reaction upon implantation intoGGTA1-KO pigs, characterized by massive inflammatory cells infiltrates, presence of foreign body giant cells, a dramatic increase of anti-alphaGal antibody titersand ultimately destruction of the graft, whereas wild-type porcine grafts inducedonly a mild reaction in GGTA1-KO pigs. Allogeneic implants, wild-type/wild-typeand GGTA1-KO/GGTA1-KO valves did not induce a measurable immune reaction. Thus,GGTA1-KO pigs developed a 'human-like' immune response toward decellularizedxenogeneic implants showing that immunogenicity of xenogeneic implants is notsufficiently reduced by decellularization, which detracts from their regenerativepotential.

AB  - Diversity analysis is a de facto standard procedure for most existing microbiome studies. Nevertheless, diversity metrics can be insensitive to changes incommunity composition (identities). For example, if species A (e.g., a beneficialmicrobe) is replaced by equal number of species B (e.g., an opportunisticpathogen), the diversity metric may not change, but the community composition haschanged. The shared species analysis (SSA) is a computational technique that can discern changes of community composition by detecting the increase/decrease ofshared species between two sets of microbiome samples, and it should be moresensitive than standard diversity analysis in discerning changes in microbiomestructures. Here, we investigated the effects of ethnicity and lifestyles inChina on the structure of Chinese gut microbiomes by reanalyzing the datasets of a large Chinese cohort with 300+ individuals covering 7 biggest Chinese ethnicgroups (>95% Chinese population). We found: (i) Regarding lifestyles, SSArevealed significant differences between 100% of pair-wise comparisons incommunity compositions across all but phylum taxon levels (phylum level = 29%),but diversity analysis only revealed 14-29% pair-wise differences in communitydiversity across all four taxon levels. (ii) Regarding ethnicities, SSA revealed 100% pair-wise differences in community compositions across all but phylum(phylum level = 48-62%) levels, but diversity analysis only revealed 5-57%differences in community diversity across all four taxon levels. (iii) Ethnicity seems to have more prevalent effects on community structures than lifestyle does (iv) Community structures of the gut microbiomes are more stable at the phylumlevel than at the other three levels. (v) SSA is more powerful than diversityanalysis in detecting the changes of community structures; furthermore, SSA canproduce lists of unique and shared OTUs. (vi) Finally, we performed stochasticityanalysis to mechanistically interpret the observed differences revealed by theSSA and diversity analyses.

AB  - This study aims to obtain anaerobic fungi from the rumen and fecal samples andinvestigates their potential for lignocellulosic bioconversion. Multipleanaerobic strains were isolated from rumen contents (CR1-CR21) and fecal samples (CF1-CF10) of Bactrian camel using the Hungate roll tube technique. Afterscreening for fiber degradability, strains from rumen contents (Oontomyces sp.CR2) and feces (Piromyces sp. CF9) were compared with Pecoramyces sp. F1 (earlierisolated from goat rumen, having high CAZymes of GHs) for various fermentationand digestion parameters. The cultures were fermented with different substrates(reed, alfalfa stalk, Broussonetia papyrifera leaves, and Melilotus officinalis) at 39 degrees C for 96 h. The Oontomyces sp. CR2 had the highest total gas andhydrogen production from most substrates in the in vitro rumen fermentationsystem and also had the highest digestion of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber,acid detergent fiber, and cellulose present in most substrates used. The isolatedstrains provided higher amounts of metabolites such as lactate, formate, acetate,and ethanol in the in vitro rumen fermentation system for use in variousindustrial applications. The results illustrated that anaerobic fungi isolatedfrom Bactrian camel rumen contents (Oontomyces sp. CR2) have the highestlignocellulosic bioconversion potential, suggesting that the Bactrian camel rumencould be a good source for the isolation of anaerobic fungi for industrialapplications.

AB  - The gut microbiota of wild birds are affected by complex factors, andcross-species transmission may pose challenges for the host to maintain stablegut symbionts. Farmland habitats are environments strongly manipulated by humans,and the environmental characteristics within a large area are highly consistent. These features provide the ideal natural conditions for conducting cross-species comparative studies on gut microbiota among wild birds. This study aimed toinvestigate and compare the gut microbiota of three common farmland-dependentbird species, Great Bustard (Otis tarda dybowskii), Common Crane (Grus grus), andCommon Coot (Fulica atra), in a homogeneous habitat during the wintering period. The results indicated that under the combined action of similar influencingfactors, the gut microbiota of different host species did not undergo adaptiveconvergence, maintained relatively independent structures, and exhibitedhost-driven signals. In addition, we also detected various pathogenic genera thatmay cause outbreaks of periodic infections among sympatric migratory birds. Weconclude that phylosymbiosis may occur between some wild birds and their gutmicrobiota. Usage of non-invasive methods to monitor the changes in the gutmicrobiota of wild bird fecal samples has important implications for theconservation of endangered species.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an infectious diseasecaused by the PRRS virus that leads to reproductive disorders and severe dyspnoeain pigs, which has serious economic impacts. One of the reasons PRRSV cannot beeffectively controlled is that it has developed countermeasures against the host immune response, allowing it to survive and replicate for long periods.Transcription Factors acts as a bridge in the interactions between the host andPRRSV. PRRSV can create an environment conducive to PRRSV replication throughtranscription factors acting on miRNAs, inflammatory factors, and immune cells.Conversely, some transcription factors also inhibit PRRSV proliferation in thehost. In this review, we systematically described how PRRSV uses hosttranscription factors such as SP1, CEBPB, STATs, and AP-1 to escape the hostimmune system. Determining the role of transcription factors in immune evasionand understanding the pathogenesis of PRRSV will help to develop new treatmentsfor PRRSV.

AB  - Human infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus causes severerespiratory diseases. Currently, the drugs against H5N1 are limited tovirus-targeted inhibitors. However, drug resistance caused by these inhibitors isbecoming a serious threat to global public health. An alternative strategy toreduce the resistance risk is to develop antiviral drugs targeting host cellproteins. In this study, we demonstrated that cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4isoform 1 (COX41) of host cell plays an important role in H5N1 infection.Overexpression of COX41 promoted viral replication, which was inhibited bysilencing or knockout the expression of COX41 in the host cell. Theribonucleoproteins (RNPs) of H5N1 were retained in the cell nucleus afterknockout cellular COX41. Strikingly, inhibition of cellular COX41 by lycorine, a small-molecule compound isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants, reduced the levelsof COX41-induced ROS and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK) in cells, thus resulting in the blockage of nuclear export of vRNP andinhibition of viral replication. In H5N1-infected mice that were treated withlycorine, we observed a reduction of viral titers and inhibition of pathological changes in the lung and trachea tissues. Importantly, no resistant virus wasgenerated after culturing the virus with the continuous treatment of lycorine.Collectively, these findings suggest that COX41 is a positive regulator of H5N1replication and might serve as an alternative target for anti-influenza drugdevelopment.

AB  - The gut microbiota is involved in a range of physiological processes in animals, and modulating the microbiome composition is considered a novel target foridentifying animal traits. Tibetan pigs show better fat deposition and diseaseresistance compared to Yorkshire pigs. However, studies investigating thecorrelation between favorable characteristics in Tibetan pigs and the gutmicrobial community remain scarce. In the current study, 1,249,822 high-qualitysequences were obtained by amplicon sequencing of the colon contents of Tibetanand Yorkshire pigs. We found that at the boundary level, the abundance andrelative abundance of colon bacterial community in Tibetan pigs were higher than that in Yorkshire pigs (P > 0.05). Phylum level, Firmicutes were the dominantcolonic microflora of Tibetan and Yorkshire pigs, and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides in Tibetan pigs was slightly higher than in Yorkshire pigs.Actinobacteria and Spirobacteria were significantly higher in Tibetan pigs thanin Yorkshire pigs (P < 0.05). At the genus level, the relative abundance ofBifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteriologist, which are related to disease resistance, was significantly higher than that in Yorkshire pigs in Yorkshirepigs. In conclusion, the composition and abundance of colonic intestinalmicroflora in Tibetan pigs were closely related to their superior traits.Bifidobacteria, Ruminococcaceae, and Family-XIII-AD3011-Group are conducive toimproving disease resistance in Tibetan pigs. Lactobacillus and Solobacteriumwere observed to be the main bacterial communities involved in fat deposition in Tibetan pigs. This study will provide a new reference for the development andutilization of Tibetan pigs in future.

AB  - Beneficial bacteria promise to promote the health and productivity of farmed fishspecies. However, the impact on host physiology is largely strain-dependent, and studies on Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a commercially farmed salmonidspecies, are lacking. In this study, 10 candidate probiotic strains weresubjected to in vitro assays, small-scale growth trials, and behavioral analysis with juvenile Arctic char to examine the impact of probiotic supplementation onfish growth, behavior and the gut microbiome. Most strains showed high tolerance to gastric juice and fish bile acid, as well as high auto-aggregation activity,which are important probiotic characteristics. However, they neither markedlyaltered the core gut microbiome, which was dominated by three bacterial species, nor detectably colonized the gut environment after the 4-week probiotictreatment. Despite a lack of long-term colonization, the presence of thebacterial strains showed either beneficial or detrimental effects on the hostthrough growth rate enhancement or reduction, as well as changes in fish motilityunder confinement. This study offers insights into the effect of bacterialstrains on a salmonid host and highlights three strains, Carnobacterium divergensV41, Pediococcus acidilactici ASG16, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarumISCAR-07436, for future research into growth promotion of salmonid fish throughprobiotic supplementation.

AB  - Bacillus cereus is a major food-borne bacterial pathogen in the world, which can cause diarrhea and emetic syndrome. This study aimed to reveal the quantitativeprevalence of B. cereus in ready-to-eat (RTE) rice products in Eastern China and to gain essential information on the characteristics of B. cereus isolates. Atotal of 91 out of the 1071 samples were positive for B. cereus. Thecontamination level of B. cereus in 0.5 % of RTE rice product samples outnumbered10(3) CFU/g. The number of B. cereus attained 10(5)-10(6) CFU/g in one sample.The distribution patterns of virulence genes in B. cereus isolates wereidentified. 84.6% of the B. cereus isolates had at least one enterotoxin oremetic toxin gene. The predominant pattern was XXV. 9.9% of isolates belonged to it and possessed one enterotoxin gene entFM. The occurrence rate of hblACD andnheABC was 36.3% and 47.3%, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility testsrevealed a high resistance rate toward penicillin, and 23.1% of the isolates weremulti-drug resistant. B. cereus isolates were genotyped by using ERIC-PCR. 89genotypes were determined. The Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI) attained0.9995. Relationships analysis revealed that Group A B. cereus isolates tended tocarry hblA, hblC, hblD, nheA, nheB, and show resistance topenicillin/trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This study was useful for updating the knowledge of the contamination status of B. cereus in RTE rice products in China.

PG  - 927245
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.927245 [doi]
AB  - Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) has shown potential as a probiotic forthe prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in both humans and mice. However, relatively little is known about the effects of A. muciniphilaon lipid metabolism, productivity, and product quality in laying hens. In thisstudy, we explored whether A. muciniphila supplementation could improve lipidmetabolism and egg quality in laying hens and sought to identify the underlyingmechanism. In the first experiment, 80 Hy-Line Brown laying hens were dividedinto four groups, one of which was fed a normal diet (control group), while theother three groups were administered a high-energy, low-protein diet to inducefatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS). Among the three FLHS groups, one wastreated with phosphate-buffered saline, one with live A. muciniphila, and onewith pasteurized A. muciniphila. In the second experiment, 140 Hy-Line Brownlaying hens were divided into two groups and respectively fed a basal dietsupplemented or not with A. muciniphila lyophilized powder. The results showedthat, in laying hens with FLHS, treatment with either live or pasteurized A.muciniphila efficiently decreased body weight, abdominal fat deposition, andlipid content in both serum and the liver; downregulated the mRNA expression oflipid synthesis-related genes and upregulated that of lipid transport-relatedgenes in the liver; promoted the growth of short-chain fatty acids(SCFAs)-producing microorganisms and increased the cecal SCFAs content; andimproved the yolk lipid profile. Additionally, the supplementation of lyophilizedpowder of A. muciniphila to aged laying hens reduced abdominal fat deposition andtotal cholesterol (TC) levels in both serum and the liver, suppressed the mRNAexpression of cholesterol synthesis-related genes in the liver, reduced TCcontent in the yolk, increased eggshell thickness, and reshaped the compositionof the gut microbiota. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that A.muciniphila can modulate lipid metabolism, thereby, promoting laying hen healthas well as egg quality and nutritive value. Live, pasteurized, and lyophilized A.muciniphila preparations all have the potential for use as additives forimproving laying hen production.

AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae (SD) is capable of infecting both humans and animalsand causing a wide range of invasive and non-invasive infections. With twosubspecies, the taxonomic status of subspecies of SD remains controversial.Subspecies equisimilis (SDSE) is an important human pathogen, while subspeciesdysgalactiae (SDSD) has been considered a strictly animal pathogen; however,occasional human infections by this subspecies have been reported in the last fewyears. Moreover, the differences between the adaptation of SDSD within humans andother animals are still unknown. In this work, we provide a phylogenomic analysisbased on the single-copy core genome of 106 isolates from both the subspecies anddifferent infected hosts (animal and human hosts). The accessory genome of thisspecies was also analyzed for screening of genes that could be specificallyinvolved with adaptation to different hosts. Additionally, we searched putativelyadaptive traits among prophage regions to infer the importance of transduction inthe adaptation of SD to different hosts. Core genome phylogenetic relationshipssegregate all human SDSE in a single cluster separated from animal SD isolates.The subgroup of bovine SDSD evolved from this later clade and harbors aspecialized accessory genome characterized by the presence of specific virulence determinants (e.g., cspZ) and carbohydrate metabolic functions (e.g., fructoseoperon). Together, our results indicate a host-specific SD and the existence ofan SDSD group that causes human-animal cluster infections may be due toopportunistic infections, and that the exact incidence of SDSD human infectionsmay be underestimated due to failures in identification based on the hemolyticpatterns. However, more detailed research into the isolation of human SD isneeded to assess whether it is a carrier phenomenon or whether the species can bepermanently integrated into the human microbiome, making it ready to causeopportunistic infections.

Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Web of Sciencewere searched for animal experiments applying EPO to treat SCI to January 2022.We included studies which examined neurological function by the Basso, Beattie,and Bresnahan (BBB) scale, as well as cavity area and spared area, anddetermining the molecular-biological analysis of antioxidative effects bymalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in spinal cord tissues. Meta-analysis were performedwith Review Manager 5.4 software. Results: A total of 33 studies were included inthis review. The results of the meta-analysis showed that SCI rats receiving EPO therapy showed a significant locomotor function recovery after 14 days comparedwith control, then the superiority of EPO therapy maintained to 28 days from BBB scale. Compared with the control group, the cavity area was reduced [4 studies,weighted mean difference (WMD) = -16.65, 95% CI (-30.74 to -2.55), P = 0.02] and spared area was increased [3 studies, WMD =11.53, 95% CI (1.34 to 21.72), P =0.03] by EPO. Meanwhile, MDA levels [2 studies, WMD = -0.63 (-1.09 to -0.18), P =0.007] were improved in the EPO treatment group compared with control, whichindicated its antioxidant effect. The subgroup analysis recommended 5,000 UI/kgis the most effective dose [WMD = 4.05 (2.23, 5.88), P < 0.0001], although itseffect was not statistically different from that of 1,000 UI/kg. Meanwhile, thedifferent rat strains (Sprague-Dawley vs. Wistar), and models of animals, as wellas administration method (single or multiple administration) of EPO did notaffect the neuroprotective effect of EPO for SCI. Conclusions: This systematicreview indicated that EPO can promote the recovery of the locomotor function ofSCI rats. The mechanism exploration of EPO needs to be verified by experiments,and then carefully designed randomized controlled trials are needed to exploreits neural recovery effects.

AB  - Allergic dermatitis is the most common type of skin disease in dogs. Of all dogs,20 to 30% present with some type of allergic dermatitis. Pruritus is one of themost important signs of allergic dermatitis and is often the most challenging to control. Interleukin-31 (IL-31) has been found to be one of the main initiatorsof pruritus in dogs with allergic dermatitis. Cytopoint(R), a caninizedmonoclonal anti-IL-31 antibody, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of dogs against allergic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. US label indication. Arecent retrospective study reported that Cytopoint achieved treatment success in 87.8% of the cases with allergic dermatitis. No prospective cohort studies havebeen performed investigating the effects of Cytopoint in dogs with allergicdermatitis using the dosing protocol prescribed on the product label in theUnited States. In this study, our objectives were to assess the efficacy ofCytopoint for treatment of canine allergic dermatitis of variable etiologies and management of the associated pruritus, and add to the body of evidence available to the veterinarian as they make treatment recommendations. Dogs included in thisstudy had moderate to severe pruritus according to the Pruritus Visual AnalogScale (PVAS; >/= 50 mm) and a history of likely continuation of pruritus at thetime of presentation. On day 0, investigators recorded the initial body weightand every patient received one dose of Cytopoint (minimum 2 mg/kg SQ) and anisoxazoline product for parasite control. Treatment success for this study wasdefined as a >/=20 mm reduction in PVAS from Day 0. On Day 7, 94% of the dogs hadachieved treatment success. On Day 28, 98% had achieved treatment success andcumulatively by day 56, 100% of the dogs achieved treatment success. Thisprospective study provides evidence that Cytopoint effectively treats dogs withallergic dermatitis of different types and the associated pruritus.

PG  - 953380
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.953380 [doi]
AB  - Neosporosis is a worldwide infectious disease caused by intracellular parasiteNeospora caninum that is a major pathogen of abortion in cattle and neurological disorders in other hosts. However, limited data are available on animals exposed to N. caninum in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA), and little is knownabout whether animals in the plateau area play an important role in theepidemiology of N. caninum. Therefore, indirect ELISAs based on a combination of NcSAG1 and NcGRA7 antigens were developed to examine both N. caninum-specific IgGand IgM antibodies in Tibetan sheep, yak, cow, pig, cattle, horse, chicken,camel, and donkey from the QTPA in this study. The results showed that allcurrent species present- IgG and IgM-positive animals, and that the overallseroprevalence of N. caninum were 18.6 (703/3,782) and 48.1% (1,820/3,782) forthe IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively. Further analysis found significantdifferences from different altitudes in IgG in Tibetan sheep and IgM in the yak. Hence, the present serological results indicate that the tested animalpopulations in the QTPA are suffering from N. caninum infections or have becomecarriers of N. caninum antibodies. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst report on current N. caninum-infected animals in the QTPA, the firstepidemiology of neosporosis in cow and camel in China, and the first record of N.caninum IgM antibodies in all the surveyed animals in China. This study provides the latest valuable data on the epidemiology of neosporosis in China and inplateau areas of the world.

AB  - Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle is omnipresent, which causessignificantly economical losses worldwide. The objective of this study was todetermine microRNA (miRNA) and transcript profiles and to establish theirrelationship in response to exposure to the virus. Small noncoding and messenger RNA were extracted and sequenced from serum and white blood cells (WBCs) derived from seven BLV seropositive and seven seronegative cows. Transcriptomic profiles were generated by sequencing RNA libraries from WBC. Bta-miR-206 andbta-miR-133a-3p were differentially expressed in serum (P < 0.05). In WBC,bta-miR-335-3p, bta-miR-375, and bta-novel-miR76-3p were differentially expressed(P < 0.03). There were 64 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). Geneontology (GO) analysis of the DETs overexpressed in the seropositive group withGOs of response to stimulus and immune system process predicted that the DETscould potentially negatively regulate viral life cycle and viral entry or releasefrom host cells. In addition, the DETs depleted in the seropositive group couldplay a role in the downregulation of antigen processing and presentation ofendogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I. The differentially expressed miRNAstargeted 17 DETs, among which the expressions of bta-miR-133a-3p andbta-miR-335-3p were significantly negatively correlated with the expressions ofENSBTAT00000079143 and ENSBTAT00000066733, respectively. Under high predictioncriteria, 90 targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were all non-DETs.The most enriched biological process GO term of the targets was the RNA-dependentDNA biosynthetic process, which could be associated with virus replication. Theseresults suggested that the differentially expressed miRNAs fine-tune most of the target genes in responding to BLV exposure. In addition, Bta-miR-206 interactedwith BLV regulatory genes rex and tax by targeting their coding regions. Afurther study of the miRNAs and the genes may reveal the molecular mechanisms of BLV infection and uncover possible ways to prevent the infection.

AB  - Zygotic gene activation (ZGA) and epigenetic reprogramming are critical in early embryonic development in mammals, and transcription factors are involved inregulating these events. However, the effects of ELF4 on porcine embryonicdevelopment remain unclear. In this study, the expression of ELF4 was detected inearly porcine embryos and different tissues. By knocking down ELF4, the changesof H3K9me3 modification, DNA methylation and ZGA-related genes were analyzed. Ourresults showed that ELF4 was expressed at all stages of early porcine embryosfertilized in vitro (IVF), with the highest expression level at the 8-cell stage.The embryonic developmental competency and blastocyst quality decreased afterELF4 knockdown (20.70% control vs. 17.49% si-scramble vs. 2.40% si-ELF4; p <0.001). Knockdown of ELF4 induced DNA damage at the 4-cell stage. Interferingwith ELF4 resulted in abnormal increases in H3K9me3 and DNA methylation levels atthe 4-cell stage and inhibited the expression of genes related to ZGA. Theseresults suggest that ELF4 affects ZGA and embryonic development competency inporcine embryos by maintaining genome integrity and regulating dynamic changes ofH3K9me3 and DNA methylation, and correctly activating ZGA-related genes topromote epigenetic reprogramming. These results provide a theoretical basis forfurther studies on the regulatory mechanisms of ELF4 in porcine embryos.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.946148 [doi]
AB  - Lysoforte (LFT) plays a vital role in maintaining broilers' health and intestinalmorphology. However, the mechanism behind the effects of LFT improving intestinalmorphology and health is still unclear. Therefore, this study was implemented to explore the central genes linked to the regulatory effect of LFT. Seventy-fivenewly hatched Cobb 500 male broilers were randomly divided into three groups:control, LFT500, and LFT1000 groups, with 25 chicks per group. The control chickswere provided with the basal diet, and the birds in LFT500 and LFT1000 groupswere offered the same basal diet with 500 g/ton and 1,000 g/ton LFT,respectively. GSE94622 dataset consisted of the control and two LFT-treatedgroups (LFT500 and LFT1000). Jejuna samples were obtained from Gene ExpressionOmnibus (GEO). Totally 106-344 DEGs were obtained by comparing LFT500 and LFT1000vs. control and LFT1000 vs. LFT500. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment suggested that the DEGs are mainly related to the phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthetic process and neuron projection extension. KEGG analysis suggested the DEGs were enrichedin AGE-RAGE, fatty acid elongation, ECM-receptor interaction (ECMRI),glycerophospholipid metabolism, focal adhesion, unsaturated fatty acidsbiosynthesis, and ABC transporters. Moreover, 29 genes, such as REG4, GJB1,KAT2A, APOA5, SERPINE2, ELOVL1, ABCC2, ANKRD9, CYP4V2, and PISD, might be closelyrelated to promoting jejuna morphology in broilers. Taken together, ourobservation enhances the understanding of LFT in maintaining intestinalarchitecture and the general health of broiler chickens.

AB  - The growth of human population has led, in recent years, to increasingly frequentcontacts with the wild animals with which we share the territory, sometimesleading to negative interactions with them. The purpose of the study is to apply the codes contained in the 11th Revision of the International Classification ofDiseases (ICD-11) method to investigate the cause and the manner of death, alsoto entrust the veterinarian with the task of recognizing and describing asuspected animal abuse as a sentinel indicator of violence toward humans andnon-humans, thus expanding the concept of "One Health" from a forensicinvestigation perspective. The subjects recruited are wild mammals submitted for autopsy to the Pathology Unit of the Department of Veterinary Science, Universityof Parma, Italy, from 2015 to 2018. The manner and the cause of death of 167 wildanimals of 16 different species have been investigated. When possible, an on-siteinspection where the corpse was found was performed. Injuries were classifiedaccording to the on-line 11th Revision of the International Classification ofDiseases method. Section 22 (Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences ofexternal causes) was used to record the "immediate cause of death" (cause ofdeath) and Section 23 (External causes of morbidity or mortality) was used torecord the "underlying cause of death" (manner of death) for each animal. In mostcases, death occurred as a result of road trauma but in some cases, abuse andvoluntary killing were investigated. The recognition of non-accidental injuriesis particularly important for both the defense in court of animals and for theconnection between crimes committed against animals and against humans, known as "The Link". The use of the ICD-11 method, as a sort of summary of the autopsyreport, was confirmed to be of great value for the clarity and simplicity ofprocessing the data collected also by veterinary pathologists. The veterinarypathologists can use this evidence-based method with the aim of creating anational register and therefore, to understand the real extent of the humanimpact on wildlife and document it in a scientific and statistically usable way.

AB  - Brainstem nuclei dysfunction is implicated in sudden unexpected death inepilepsy. In animal models, deficient serotonergic activity is associated withseizure-induced respiratory arrest. In humans, glia are decreased in theventrolateral medullary pre-Botzinger complex that modulate respiratory rhythm,as well as in the medial medullary raphe that modulate respiration and arousal.Finally, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy cases have decreased midbrainvolume. To understand the potential role of brainstem nuclei in sudden unexpecteddeath in epilepsy, we evaluated molecular signalling pathways using localizedproteomics in microdissected midbrain dorsal raphe and medial medullary rapheserotonergic nuclei, as well as the ventrolateral medulla in brain tissue fromepilepsy patients who died of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and othercauses in diverse epilepsy syndromes and non-epilepsy control cases (n = 15-16cases per group/region). Compared with the dorsal raphe of non-epilepsy controls,we identified 89 proteins in non-sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and 219proteins in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy that were differentiallyexpressed. These proteins were associated with inhibition of EIF2 signalling(P-value of overlap = 1.29 x 10(-8), z = -2.00) in non-sudden unexpected death inepilepsy. In sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, there were 10 activatedpathways (top pathway: gluconeogenesis I, P-value of overlap = 3.02 x 10(-6), z =2.24) and 1 inhibited pathway (fatty acid beta-oxidation, P-value of overlap =2.69 x 10(-4), z = -2.00). Comparing sudden unexpected death in epilepsy andnon-sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, 10 proteins were differentiallyexpressed, but there were no associated signalling pathways. In both medullaryregions, few proteins showed significant differences in pairwise comparisons. We identified altered proteins in the raphe and ventrolateral medulla of epilepsypatients, including some differentially expressed in sudden unexpected death inepilepsy cases. Altered signalling pathways in the dorsal raphe of suddenunexpected death in epilepsy indicate a shift in cellular energy production andactivation of G-protein signalling, inflammatory response, stress response andneuronal migration/outgrowth. Future studies should assess the brain proteome in relation to additional clinical variables (e.g. recent tonic-clonic seizures) andin more of the reciprocally connected cortical and subcortical regions to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy and sudden unexpected death inepilepsy.

AB  - Objective.Sleep perturbation by environment, medical procedure and geneticbackground is under continuous study in biomedical research. Analyzing brainstates in animal models such as rodents relies on categorizingelectroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Traditionally, sleep experts haveclassified these states by visual inspection of EEG signatures, which islaborious. The heterogeneity of sleep patterns complicates the development of ageneralizable solution across different species, genotypes and experimentalenvironments.Approach.To realize a generalizable solution, we proposed across-species rodent sleep scoring network called CSSleep, a robust deep-learningmodel based on single-channel EEG. CSSleep starts with a local time-invariantinformation learning convolutional neural network. The second module is theglobal transition rules learning temporal convolutional network (TRTCN), stacked with bidirectional attention-based temporal convolutional network modules. TheTRTCN simultaneously captures positive and negative time direction informationand highlights relevant in-sequence features. The dataset for model evaluationcomprises the single-EEG signatures of four cohorts of 16 mice and 8 rats fromthree laboratories.Main results.In leave-one-cohort-out cross-validation, ourmodel achieved an accuracy of 91.33%. CSSleep performed well on generalizationacross experimental environments, mutants and rodent species by usingsingle-channel EEG.Significance.This study aims to promote well-standardizedcross-laboratory sleep studies to improve our understanding of sleep. Our source codes and supplementary materials will be disclosed later.

AB  - Secondary cell walls (SCW) in stem cells provide mechanical strength andstructural support for growth. SCW thickening varies under different lightconditions. Our previous study revealed that blue light enhances SCW thickeningthrough the redundant function of MYC2 and MYC4 directed by CRYPTOCHROME1 (CRY1) signaling in fiber cells of Arabidopsis inflorescence stem. In this study, wefind that the Arabidopsis PHYTOCHROME B mutant (phyB) displays thinner SCWs instem fibers, but thicker SCWs are deposited in the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTINGFACTORS (PIFs) quadruple mutant pif1pif3pif4pif5 (pifq). The shaded lightcondition with low ratio of red: far-red light (R:FR) inhibits stem SCWthickening. PIF4 interacts with MYC2 and MYC4 to affect their localization innuclei and such interaction results in inhibition of the MYCs' transactivationactivity on the NST1 promoter. Genetic evidence shows that regulation of the SCW thickening by PIFs is dependent on MYC2/MYC4 function. Together, this studyreveals a PHYB-PIF4-MYC2/MYC4 module that inhibits SCW thickening in fiber cells of Arabidopsis stem.

PG  - e12243
LID - 10.1002/jev2.12243 [doi]
AB  - Cancer vaccines critically rely on the availability of targetable immunogeniccancer-specific neoepitopes. However, mutation-based immunogenic neoantigens are rare or even non-existent in subgroups of cancer types. To address this issue, weexploited a cancer-specific aberrant transcription-induced chimeric RNA,designated A-Pas chiRNA, as a possible source of clinically relevant andtargetable neoantigens. A-Pas chiRNA encodes a recently discoveredcancer-specific chimeric protein that comprises full-length astrotactin-2 (ASTN2)C-terminally fused in-frame to the antisense sequence of the 18(th) intron ofpregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA). We used extracellular vesicles(EVs) from A-Pas chiRNA-transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to produce thecell-free anticancer vaccine DEXA-P . Treatment of immunocompetent cancer-bearingmice with DEXA-P inhibited tumour growth and prolonged animal survival. Insummary, we demonstrate for the first time that cancer-specifictranscription-induced chimeric RNAs can be exploited to produce a cell-freecancer vaccine that induces potent CD8(+) T cell-mediated anticancer immunity.Our novel approach may be particularly useful for developing cancer vaccines totreat malignancies with low mutational burden or without mutation-based antigens.Moreover, this cell-free anticancer vaccine approach may offer several practical advantages over cell-based vaccines, such as ease of scalability and geneticmodifiability as well as enhanced shelf life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that Curcumin exerts neuroprotective effects in animal models with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). However,the mechanisms of protective effects of curcumin in MCAO have not fullyunderstood. This study is aim to investigate the neurogenesis key targets ofCurcumin action in mouse brain with MCAO. METHODS: The MCAO models wereestablished in mice. High-Throughput Sequencing was used to identifydifferentially expressed mRNA, lncRNA and circRNA. The reverse expressed mRNAs,lncRNA and circRNA in sham vs MCAO and MCAO vs curcumin were identified.Biological functions were determined by gene ontology (GO) analyses. Theprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network of neurogenesis related genes wasconstructed. Next, neurogenesis related lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networkwere constructed. RESULTS: The total of reverse expressed 1215 mRNAs, 32 lncRNAs,and 43 circRNAs were filtered based on the 2 series (sham vs MCAO and MCAO vscurcumin). The functional enrichment of 1215 reverse expressed mRNAs wereinvolved in neurogenesis, generation of neurons, regulation of neurogenesis andothers. The PPI network of neurogenesis related genes consisted of 115 nodes, andincluding curcumin downregulated 27 genes and upregulated 36 genes. Further, the neurogenesis related lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNAs network were constructed,and 5 lncRNA ceRNA network and 3 circRNA ceRNA network were explored. CONCLUSION:Our study revealed that curcumin exert neuroprotective effects by regulatingneurogenesis The neurogenesis related lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network arepotential therapeutic targets of curcumin in MCAO. This study provided atheoretical basis for curcumin exerts neuroprotective effects in MCAO.

TI  - Purification, Partial Characterization, and Evaluation of the Antiulcer Activity of Calotropis procera Leaf Lectin.
LID - 10.2174/0929866529666220803162457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lectins are proteins with therapeutic and diagnostic potential thatcan be applied in battling various ailments. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This study wasdesigned to purify and characterize the hemagglutinating activity derived fromthe leaves of Calotropis procera and its possible role in protecting the stomach against ethanol-induced lesions. METHODS: The Calotropis procera leaf lectin(ProLec), was isolated by homogenization of the defatted leaf powder inPhosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and purified by affinity chromatography onSephadex G-100. The lectin was eluted from the affinity column by 3% acetic acid and was physicochemically characterized. In a dose-dependent manner, ProLec wasadministered to rats with ethanol-induced ulcers, Biochemical, histopathological and toxicological examinations were performed. RESULTS: ProLec is a heterodimerof 75 and 68kDa. It agglutinated all human RBCs, whereas it showed weakinteraction with animal erythrocytes. The protein was optimally active at 25degrees C and was labile above this temperature. ProLec exhibited two pH optimaand was a metalo-protein requiring Ca, Mn, and Ni. It contains 1.6% tryptophanresidues of which about 1% is exposed and critical for lectin activity. Thelectin exhibited a potent gastroprotective effect against ethanol-induced gastriclesions with no apparent toxicity to both kidneys and liver. Examination of thepH of the gastric juice of lectin treated animals indicated a possible role oflectin in maintaining stomach acidity within the normal ranges compared to thegastric juice pH of animals that received ethanol only. CONCLUSION: These resultsmay suggest that ProLec could conceivably be a good future drug for the treatmentof gastric ulcers, however, extensive immunological and toxicologically research remains needed.

TI  - Antimicrobial application of chitosan derivatives and their nanocomposites.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220803114729 [doi]
AB  - Chitosan is derived from chitin polysaccharide, the main component of crustacean shells. Chitosan is a biocompatible, nontoxic, and biodegradable polymer soluble in acidic solutions. It is widely used in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. Antimicrobial activities of chitosan against different bacterial, fungal, andviral pathogens have been considered one of its attractive properties, makingchitosan valuable for biological applications, including textiles, food, tissueengineering, agriculture, and environmental protection. Additionally, chitosanhas beneficial effects on livestock, poultry, fish, and crustaceans, which canenhance immunity, improve feed conversion, and promote growth. However, the watersolubility of chitosan influences antimicrobial capabilities, limiting itsapplication. In the present work, we reviewed the preparation, factors affecting antimicrobial activity, morphological structure, antimicrobial mechanism, andapplication of chitosan derivatives, and the problems and prospects were pointed out. Collectively, this review provided an update on the application of chitosan derivatives and their potential for further advanced applications in theantimicrobial field.

TI  - Local assessment of the immunohistochemical expression of Foxp3(+) regulatory Tlymphocytes in the different pathological forms associated with bovineparatuberculosis.
PG  - 299
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03399-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infected animals show avariety of granulomatous lesions, from focal forms with well-demarcatedgranulomas restricted to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), that are seenin the initial phases or latency stages, to a diffuse granulomatous enteritis,with abundant (multibacillary) or scant (paucibacillary) bacteria, seen inclinical stages. Factors that determine the response to the infection,responsible for the occurrence of the different types of lesion, are still notfully determined. It has been seen that regulatory T cells (Treg) play animportant role in various diseases where they act on the limitation of theimmunopathology associated with the immune response. In the case ofparatuberculosis (PTB) the role of Treg lymphocytes in the immunity against Mapis far away to be completely understood; therefore, several studies addressingthis subject have appeared recently. The aim of this work was to assess, byimmunohistochemical methods, the presence of Foxp3(+) T lymphocytes in intestinalsamples with different types of lesions seen in cows with PTB. METHODS:Intestinal samples of twenty cows showing the different pathological forms of PTBwere evaluated: uninfected controls (n = 5), focal lesions (n = 5), diffusepaucibacillary (n = 5) and diffuse multibacillary (n = 5) forms. Foxp3(+)lymphocyte distribution was assessed by differential cell count in intestinallamina propria (LP), gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and mesenteric lymphnode (MLN). RESULTS: A significant increase in the number of Foxp3(+) T cells wasobserved in infected animals with respect to control group, regardless of thetype of lesion. However, when the different categories of lesion were analyzedindependently, all individuals with PTB lesions showed an increase in the amount of Foxp3(+) T lymphocytes compared to the control group but this increase wasonly significant in cows with focal lesions and, to a lesser extent, in animalswith diffuse paucibacillary forms. The former showed the highest numbers,significantly different from those found in cows with diffuse lesions, where nodifferences were noted between the two forms. No specific distribution patternwas observed within the granulomatous lesions in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of Foxp3(+) T cells in focal forms, that have been associated withlatency or resistance to infection, suggest an anti-inflammatory action of these cells at these stages, helping to prevent exacerbation of the inflammatoryresponse, as occurs in diffuse forms, responsible for the appearance of clinical signs.

TI  - Dietary resistant starch alleviates Escherichia coli-induced bone loss in meatducks by promoting short-chain fatty acid production and inhibitingMalt1/NF-kappaB inflammasome activation.
PG  - 92
LID - 10.1186/s40104-022-00739-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection in humans and animals usuallycomes with gut dysbiosis, which is potential culprit to skeletal health, it isstill unclear to whether diet interfered gut microbiome changes can be aprotective strategy to bone loss development. Here, the effects of resistantstarch from raw potato starch (RPS), a type of prebiotic, on E. coli-induced boneloss and gut microbial composition in meat ducks were evaluated. RESULTS: Theresults showed that dietary 12% RPS treatment improved bone quality, depressedbone resorption, and attenuated the pro-inflammatory reaction in both ileum andbone marrow. Meanwhile, the 12% RPS diet also increased the abundance ofFirmicutes in E. coli-treated birds, along with higher production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) especially propionate and butyrate. Whereas addition ofbeta-acid, an inhibitor of bacterial SCFAs production, to the drinking water ofducks fed 12% RPS diet significantly decreased SCFAs level in cecum content andeliminated RPS-induced tibial mass improvement. Further, treatment with MI-2 toabrogate mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1(Malt1) activity replicated the protective role of dietary 12% RPS in E.coli-induced bone loss including reduced the inhibition on nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inflammasome activation, decreased bone resorption, and improved bonequality, which were correlated with comparable and higher regulatory T cells(Treg) frequency in MI-2 and 12% RPS group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Thesefindings suggested that the diet with 12% RPS could alleviate E. coli-inducedbone loss in meat ducks by changing the gut microbial composition and promotingconcomitant SCFAs production, and consequently inhibiting Malt1/NF-kappaBinflammasome activation and Treg cells expansion.

TI  - Dominant changes in the breast muscle lipid profiles of broiler chickens withwooden breast syndrome revealed by lipidomics analyses.
PG  - 93
LID - 10.1186/s40104-022-00743-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chicken is the most consumed meat worldwide and the industry has beenfacing challenging myopathies. Wooden breast (WB), which is often accompanied by white striping (WS), is a serious myopathy adversely affecting meat quality ofbreast muscles. The underlying lipid metabolic mechanism of WB affected broilers is not fully understood. RESULTS: A total of 150 chickens of a white-feathered,fast-growing pure line were raised and used for the selection of WB, WB + WS and control chickens. The lipids of the breast muscle, liver, and serum fromdifferent chickens were extracted and measured using ultra performance liquidchromatography (UPLC) plus Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. In thebreast, 560 lipid molecules were identified. Compared to controls, 225/225 of 560lipid molecules (40.2%) were identified with differential abundance (DA),including 92/100 significantly increased neutral lipids and 107/98 decreasedphospholipids in the WB/WB + WS groups, respectively. The content ofmonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was significantly higher, and thepolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) weresignificantly lower in the affected breasts. In the liver, 434 lipid moleculeswere identified, and 39/61 DA lipid molecules (6.7%/14.1%) were detected in theWB and WB + WS groups, respectively. In the serum, a total of 529 lipid moleculeswere identified and 4/44 DA lipid molecules (0.8%/8.3%) were detected in WB andWB + WS group, respectively. Compared to controls, the content of MUFAs in theserum and breast of the WB + WS group were both significantly increased, and the content of SFAs in two tissues were both significantly decreased. Only five lipidmolecules were consistently increased in both liver and serum in WB + WS group.CONCLUSIONS: We have found for the first time that the dominant lipid profilealterations occurred in the affected breast muscle. The relative abundance of40.2% of lipid molecules were changed and is characteristic of increased neutral lipids and decreased phospholipids in the affected breasts.

AB  - Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most important livestock diseasesrestricting international trade. While African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) act asthe main wildlife reservoir, viral and immune response dynamics during FMD virus acute infection have not been described before in this species. We usedexperimental needle inoculation and contact infections with three SouthernAfrican Territories serotypes to assess clinical, virological and immunologicaldynamics for thirty days post infection. Clinical FMD in the needle inoculatedbuffalo was mild and characterised by pyrexia. Despite the absence of generalisedvesicles, all contact animals were readily infected with their respectiveserotypes within the first two to nine days after being mixed with needlechallenged buffalo. Irrespective of the route of infection or serotype, therewere positive associations between the viral loads in blood and the induction of host innate pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins. Viral loads inblood and tonsil swabs were tightly correlated during the acute phase of theinfection, however, viraemia significantly declined after a peak at four dayspost-infection (dpi), which correlated with the presence of detectableneutralising antibodies. In contrast, infectious virus was isolated in the tonsilswabs until the last sampling point (30 dpi) in most animals. The pattern ofvirus detection in serum and tonsil swabs was similar for all three serotypes in the direct challenged and contact challenged animals. We have demonstrated forthe first time that African buffalo are indeed systemically affected by FMD virusand clinical FMD in buffalo is characterized by a transient pyrexia. Despite the lack of FMD lesions, infection of African buffalo was characterised by high viralloads in blood and oropharynx, rapid and strong host innate and adaptive immuneresponses and high transmissibility.

PG  - 400
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03022-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic impacts to the articular joint surface are known to lead tocartilage degeneration, as in post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Limitedprogress in the development of disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) may be due to insufficient mechanistic understanding of human disease onset/progression andinsufficient in vitro models for disease and therapeutic modeling. In this study,biomimetic hydrogels laden with adult human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) areused to examine the effects of traumatic impacts as a model of PTOA. Wehypothesize that MSC-based, engineered cartilage models will respond to traumaticimpacts in a manner congruent with early PTOA pathogenesis observed in animalmodels. METHODS: Engineered cartilage constructs were fabricated by encapsulatingadult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a photocross-linkable, biomimetic hydrogel of 15% methacrylated gelatin and promoting chondrogenicdifferentiation for 28 days in a defined medium and TGF-beta3. Constructs weresubjected to traumatic impacts with different strains or 10 ng/ml IL-1beta, as a common comparative method of modeling OA. Cell viability and metabolism, elastic modulus, gene expression, matrix protein production and activation of catabolicenzymes were assessed. RESULTS: Cell viability staining showed that traumaticimpacts of 30% strain caused an appropriate level of cell death in engineeredcartilage constructs. Gene expression and histo/immunohistochemical analysesrevealed an acute decrease in anabolic activities, such as COL2 and ACANexpression, and a rapid increase in catabolic enzyme expression, e.g., MMP13, andinflammatory modulators, e.g., COX2. Safranin O staining and GAG assays together revealed a transient decrease in matrix production 24 h after trauma thatrecovered within 7 days. The decrease in elastic modulus of engineered cartilage constructs was coincident with GAG loss and mediated by the encapsulated cells.The acute and transient changes observed after traumatic impacts contrasted with progressive changes observed using continual IL-1beta treatment. CONCLUSIONS:Traumatic impacts delivered to engineered cartilage constructs induced PTOA-like changes in the encapsulated cells. While IL-1b may be appropriate in modeling OA pathogenesis, the results of this study indicate it may not be appropriate inunderstanding the etiology of PTOA. The development of a more physiological invitro PTOA model may contribute to the more rapid development of DMOADs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the fourth COVID-19 wave in Japan, marked differences becameapparent in the scale of the epidemic between metropolitan Tokyo in eastern Japanand Osaka prefecture in western Japan. METHODS: Public epidemic data wereanalyzed, with performance of mathematical simulations using simplified SEIRmodels. RESULTS: The increase in the number of infected persons per 100,000population during the fourth wave of expansion was greater in Osaka than inTokyo. The basic reproduction number in Osaka was greater than in Tokyo.Particularly, the number of infected people in their 20 s increased during thefourth wave: The generation-specific reproduction number for people in their 20 swas higher than for people of other generations. Both Tokyo and Osaka were found to have strong correlation between the increase in the number of infected people and the average number of people using the main downtown stations at night.Simulations showed vaccination of people in their 60 s and older reduced thenumber of infected people among the high-risk elderly population in the fourthwave. However, age-specific vaccination of people in their 20 s reduced thenumber of infected people more than vaccination of people in their 60 s andolder. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the epidemic between Tokyo and Osaka areexplainable by different behaviors of the most socially active generation. Whenvaccine supplies are adequate, priority should be assigned to high-risk olderadults, but if vaccine supplies are scarce, simulation results suggestconsideration of vaccinating specific groups among whom the epidemic is spreadingrapidly.

PG  - 136
LID - 10.1186/s12880-022-00867-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered neural activity based on the fractional amplitude oflow-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) has been reported in patients with diabetes.However, whether fALFF can differentiate healthy controls from diabetic animalsunder anesthesia remains unclear. The study aimed to elucidate the changes infALFF in a rat model of diabetes under isoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: The first group of rats (n = 5) received a single intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg/kgstreptozotocin (STZ) to cause the development of diabetes. The second group ofrats (n = 7) received a single intraperitoneal injection of the same volume ofsolvent. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assessbrain activity at 4 weeks after STZ or solvent administration. RESULTS: Compared to the healthy control animals, rats with diabetes showed significantly decreasedfALFF in various brain regions, including the cingulate cortex, somatosensorycortex, insula, and striatum (all P < 0.05). The decreased fALFF suggests theaberrant neural activities in the diabetic rats. No regions were detected inwhich the control group had a lower fALFF than that in the diabetes group.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that the fALFF could be used to differentiate healthy controls from diabetic animals, providing meaningfulinformation regarding the neurological pathophysiology of diabetes in animalmodels.

TI  - Development of an adverse outcome pathway network for breast cancer: acomprehensive representation of the pathogenesis, complexity and diversity of thedisease.
LID - 10.1007/s00204-022-03351-w [doi]
AB  - Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), introduced in modern toxicology, intend toprovide an evidence-based representation of toxicological effects and facilitate safety assessment of chemicals not solely based on laboratory animal in vivoexperiments. However, some toxicological processes are too complicated torepresent in one AOP. Therefore, AOP networks are developed that helpunderstanding and predicting toxicological processes where complex exposurescenarios interact and lead to the emergence of the adverse outcome. In thisstudy, we present an AOP network for breast cancer, developed after an in-depthsurvey of relevant scientific literature. Several molecular initiating events(MIE) were identified and various key events that link the MIEs with breastcancer were described. The AOP was developed according to Organization ofEconomic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) guidance, weight of evidence wasassessed through the Bradford Hill criteria and confidence was tested by the OECDkey questions. The AOP network provides a straightforward understanding of thedisease onset and progression at different biological levels. It can be used topinpoint knowledge gaps, identify novel therapeutic targets and act as a steppingstone for the development of novel in vitro test methods for hazardidentification and risk assessment of newly developed chemicals and drugs.

TI  - Host taxonomy determines the composition, structure, and diversity of theearthworm cast microbiome under homogenous feeding conditions.
LID - fiac093 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiac093 [doi]
AB  - Host evolutionary history is a key factor shaping the earthworm cast microbiome, although its effect can be shadowed by the earthworm's diet. To untangle dietary from taxon effects, we raised nine earthworm species on a uniform diet of cowmanure and compared cast microbiome across species while controlling for diet.Our results showed that, under controlled laboratory conditions, earthwormmicrobiomes are species-specific, more diverse than that of the controlled diet, and mainly comprised of native bacteria (i.e., not acquired from the diet).Furthermore, diet has a medium to large convergence effect on microbiomecomposition since earthworms shared 16 to 74% of their bacterial ampliconsequence variants (ASV). The inter-species core microbiome included 10 ASVs,while their intra-species core microbiomes were larger and varied in ASV richness(24-48%) and sequence abundance across earthworm species. This specificity incore microbiomes and variable degree of similarity in bacterial compositionsuggest that phylosymbiosis could determine earthworm microbiome assembly.However, lack of congruence between the earthworm phylogeny and the microbiomedendrogram suggests that a consistent diet fed over several generations may have weakened potential phylosymbiotic effects. Thus, cast microbiome assembly inearthworms seem to be the result of an interplay among host phylogeny and diet.

AB  - In the present study, the dry matter, crude ash, crude protein, ether extract,and energy, macro- (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P), micro- (Zn, Cu, Fe) minerals, heavy metals(Pb, Cd), vitamin C, A, carotene, and phenolic content were determined in chosen raw and fermented vegetables. The dietary intake of several macro- andmicroconstituents per one serving (100 g or humans and animals: ducks and pigs)was calculated. The fermentation process was found to reduce water and increasefat content in the vegetables. Lower levels of vitamin C and phenols were alsofound in the fermented vegetables. The vitamin A and carotene content in thefermented carrots and peppers were increased in comparison with the rawvegetables. The fermentation process decreased the concentration of some basicnutrients, mineral content, vitamins C and A, and phenols. Broccoli, peppers, andred beet had the highest levels of the analyzed nutrients and bioconstituents.The fermentation process is regarded by nutritionists as beneficial to humanhealth. The addition of fermented plants is recommended in animal nutrition aswell. This process modifies the chemical composition of preserved vegetables,e.g. it reduces the concentration of dietary fiber, and brings favorable effects in poultry and pig nutrition.

LID - 10.1093/femspd/ftac026 [doi]
AB  - Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture systems have historically provided controlled, reproducible means to analyze host-pathogen interactions observed in the humanreproductive tract. Although inexpensive, straightforward, and requiring a veryshort time commitment, these models recapitulate neither the functionality ofmulti-layered cell types nor the associated microbiome that occurs in a human.Animal models have commonly been used to recreate the complexity of humaninfections. However, extensive modifications of animal models are required torecreate interactions that resemble those in the human reproductive tract.Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models have emerged as alternative means ofreproducing vital elements of human infections at a fraction of the cost ofanimal models and on a scale that allows for replicative experiments. Here wedescribe a new 3D model that utilizes transwells with epithelial cells seededapically and a basolateral extracellular matrix (ECM)-like layer. The modelproduced tissues with morphologic and physiological resemblance to human cervicaland vaginal epithelia, including mucus levels produced by cervical cells.Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was demonstrated, aswell as the growth of bacterial species observed in the human vaginal microbiota.This enabled controlled mechanistic analyses of the interactions between hostcells, the vaginal microbiota and STI pathogens.

TI  - Comparative study of different liquid diets for dairy calves and the impact onperformance and the bacterial community during diarrhea.
PG  - 13394
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17613-1 [doi]
AB  - The liquid diet composition can affect dairy calves' performance and diarrheaincidence. The effect of three liquid diets on performance, incidence ofdiarrhea, and microbial community during diarrhea occurrence in dairy calves wereevaluated. At birth, 35 dairy calves (20 male and 15 female) were randomlyassigned to one of three treatments-refrigerated whole milk (WM), acidified wholemilk (AWM), and milk replacer (MR). Intake, fecal score, and rectal temperaturewere evaluated daily, and performance and blood parameters were evaluated weekly during the preweaning period. Fecal samples from diarrheic calves were collected,and one initial and one final sample for each episode were selected. Thebacterial community was assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNAgene on the Illumina MiSeq platform and analyzed using the DADA2 pipeline. Calvesfed WM had higher body weight at weaning, average daily gain, body measurements, and concentration of blood metabolites. The AWM-fed calves had a lower rectaltemperature and fever days. Moreover, the MR-fed calves had lowerbeta-hydroxybutyrate concentration and a higher incidence of diarrhea. The fecal bacterial community of diarrheic calves showed dissimilarity among the AWM andthe other treatments. At the compositional level, we observed a higher abundance of Fusobacterium and Ruminococcus genera (AWM), Prevotella (WM), andLactobacillus (MR). In the AWM and MR diarrheic calves' feces, we also observedsome beneficial bacterial genera. The performance and incidence of diarrhea ofdairy calves were influenced by the liquid diet consumed and the bacterialcomposition of diarrhea.

AB  - Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) can be measured in waters across theUnited States, including the tributaries of the Great Lakes. The extent to which these contaminants affect gene expression in aquatic wildlife is unclear. Thisdataset presents the full hepatic transcriptomes of laboratory-reared fatheadminnows (Pimephales promelas) caged at multiple sites within the MilwaukeeEstuary Area of Concern and control sites. Following 4 days of in situ exposure, liver tissue was removed from males at each site for RNA extraction andsequencing, yielding a total of 116 samples from which libraries were prepared,pooled, and sequenced. For each exposure site, 179 chemical analytes were alsoassessed. These data were created with the intention of inviting research onpossible transcriptomic changes observed in aquatic species exposed to CECs.Access to both full sequencing reads of animal samples as well as watercontaminant data across multiple Great Lakes sites will allow others to explorethe health of these ecosystems in support of the aims of the Great LakesRestoration Initiative.

TI  - Immune responses and protective immunity in Pangasius pangasius (Hamilton, 1822) as induced by outer membrane proteins of Edwardsiella tarda and aluminiumhydroxide adjuvant complex.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09978-5 [doi]
AB  - Edwardsiella tarda is considered one of the important bacterial fish pathogens.The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of E. tarda are structurally and functionally conserved, and immunogenic. This study assessed the effects of the OMPs of E.tarda CGH9 as a vaccine without aluminium hydroxide [AH] (T1) and with AHadjuvant (T2) on the respiratory burst (ROB) activity, lymphocyte proliferationof head kidney (HK) leukocytes, and serum antibody production in pangas catfishPangasius pangasius. The ROB activity and lymphocyte proliferation of HKleukocytes increased in both vaccinated groups compared to the control.Nonetheless, the T2 group showed a gradual increase in ROB activity andlymphocyte proliferation of HK leukocytes up to 3-weeks post-vaccination (wpv).The serum antibody production in the T1 group decreased initially for up to 2-wpvand increased from 3-wpv; whereas, in the T2 group, the serum-specific antibodylevels were significantly high from 1-wpv compared to control. Simultaneously,the protective efficacy in terms of relative percentage survival in the T2 group after injecting with a lethal dose of E. tarda CGH9 was high (89.00+/-15.56)compared to the T1 group (78.00+/-0.00). Furthermore, the catfish administeredwith a booster dose of E. tarda OMPs with or without AH adjuvant showed noadditional increase in immune response or protective immunity. These resultssuggested that E. tarda OMPs and AH adjuvant complex has a higher potential toinduce protective immunity, which may be a good choice as a vaccine to combat E. tarda infection in catfish.

TI  - Human pressure drives biodiversity-multifunctionality relationships in largeNeotropical wetlands.
LID - 10.1038/s41559-022-01827-7 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have shown that biodiversity regulates multiple ecological functionsthat are needed to maintain the productivity of a variety of ecosystem types.What is unknown is how human activities may alter the 'multifunctionality' ofecosystems through both direct impacts on ecosystems and indirect effectsmediated by the loss of multifaceted biodiversity. Using an extensive database of72 lakes spanning four large Neotropical wetlands in Brazil, we demonstrate that species richness and functional diversity across multiple larger (fish andmacrophytes) and smaller (microcrustaceans, rotifers, protists and phytoplankton)groups of aquatic organisms are positively associated with ecosystemmultifunctionality. Whereas the positive association between smaller organismsand multifunctionality broke down with increasing human pressure, this positiverelationship was maintained for larger organisms despite the increase in humanpressure. Human pressure impacted multifunctionality both directly and indirectlythrough reducing species richness and functional diversity of multiple organismalgroups. These findings provide further empirical evidence about the importance ofaquatic biodiversity for maintaining wetland multifunctionality. Despite the key role of biodiversity, human pressure reduces the diversity of multiple groups of aquatic organisms, eroding their positive impacts on a suite of ecologicalfunctions that sustain wetlands.

TI  - First report of Przhevalskiana silenus derived recombinant hypodermin C basedindirect ELISA for serodiagnosis of goat warble fly myiasis.
PG  - 13440
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17760-5 [doi]
AB  - Goat warble fly infestation (GWFI) is a subcutaneous myiasis caused by larvae of Przhevalskiana silenus, an insect belonging to the order Diptera. The diagnosisof GWFI is challenging in the early larval instars (L1 and L2) as they are occultunder the skin and hair coat causing prolonged economic loss in form of meat and hide damage. This necessitates early diagnosis for disease control at herd level and its prophylactic management to prevent economic losses. Hypodermins, a class of serine proteases from Hypoderminae subfamily have been used as serodiagnostic antigens for the past four decades for diagnosis of warble fly myiasis. In thisstudy,the immunodominant antigen Hypodermin C (HyC) from P. silenus has beenrecombinantly expressed in E. coli and immunogenic characterisation of expressed protein was done. The protein shows hallmark residues in conserved cysteine andcatalytic triad typical of serine proteases along with similar profile ofimmunoreactivity towards Hypoderminae infestation. The present study reports anoptimised indirect-ELISA based on recombinant HyC derived from P. silenus forearly diagnosis of GWFI. The optimised indirect ELISA provides a sensitive andspecific immunodiagnostic for mass surveillance of the GWFI with diagnosticspecificity and sensitivity of 96% and 100%, respectively and not showing anycross reactivity against other important parasitic and bacterial diseases ofgoats. This study presents the first report of indirect ELISA based onrecombinant Hypodermin C antigen derived from P. silenus for the serosurveillanceof goat warble fly disease.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16456-0 [doi]
AB  - Interactive biorobotics provides unique experimental potential to study themechanisms underlying social communication but is limited by our ability to buildexpressive robots that exhibit the complex behaviours of birds and small mammals.An alternative to physical robots is to use virtual environments. Here, wedesigned and built a modular, audio-visual 2D virtual environment that allowsmulti-modal, multi-agent interaction to study mechanisms underlying socialcommunication. The strength of the system is an implementation based on eventprocessing that allows for complex computation. We tested this system insongbirds, which provide an exceptionally powerful and tractable model system to study social communication. We show that pair-bonded zebra finches (Taeniopygiaguttata) communicating through the virtual environment exhibit normal call timingbehaviour, males sing female directed song and both males and females displayhigh-intensity courtship behaviours to their mates. These results suggest thatthe environment provided is sufficiently natural to elicit these behavioralresponses. Furthermore, as an example of complex behavioral annotation, wedeveloped a fully unsupervised song motif detector and used it to manipulate the virtual social environment of male zebra finches based on the number of motifssung. Our virtual environment represents a first step in real-time automaticbehaviour annotation and animal-computer interaction using higher levelbehaviours such as song. Our unsupervised acoustic analysis eliminates the needfor annotated training data thus reducing labour investment and experimenterbias.

LID - 10.1038/s41514-022-00081-2 [doi]
AB  - Social interactions play important roles in the modulation of behavior,physiology, and, potentially, lifespan. Although longevity has been studiedextensively in different model organisms, due to the complexity of socialenvironments, the social modulation of aging remains poorly investigated. Thepresent study used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model to studylifespan and stress resistance under different social conditions. Our experimentsfirst showed that social isolation increased fly lifespan, suggesting a potentialdeleterious effect of social companions. Furthermore, we exposed flies todifferent aged social partners and found that living with old animalssignificantly reduced lifespan and stress resistance in young animals. Incontrast, living with young animals increased old animal lifespan, although theeffects were less robust. Overall, our results suggest that while socialinteraction can influence fly health, specific social partners may have morepronounced effects than others. This study provides new evidence that differentsocial environments have significant impacts on animal physiology and longevity.

LID - 10.1093/gerona/glac162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age-associated cognitive decline may be influenced by testosteronestatus. However, studies evaluating the impact of bioavailable testosterone, the active, free testosterone, on cognitive function are scarce. Our study determinedthe relationship between calculated bioavailable testosterone and cognitiveperformance in older men. METHODS: We used data from the US National Health andNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2013 and 2014. This study consistedof 208 men aged >/= 60 years. Bioavailable serum testosterone was calculatedbased on the total serum testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and albumin levels, while cognitive performance was assessed through the Consortium toEstablish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List Learning Test(WLLT), Word List Recall Test (WLRT), and Intrusion Test (WLLT-IC and WLRT-IC),the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST).Multiple linear regression analyses were performed upon adjustment for age,ethnicity, socio-economic status, education level, medical history, body massindex, energy, alcohol intake, physical activity levels and sleep duration.RESULTS: A significant positive association between bioavailable testosterone andDSST (beta: 0.049, P=0.002) score was detected, with no signs of a plateaueffect. No significant associations with CERAD WLLT (P=0.132), WLRT (P=0.643),WLLT-IC (P=0.979), and WLRT-IC (P=0.387), and AFT (P=0.057) were observed.CONCLUSION: Calculated bioavailable testosterone presented a significant positiveassociation with processing speed, sustained attention and working memory inolder men above 60 years of age. Further research is warranted to elucidate theimpact of the inevitable age-related decline in testosterone on cognitivefunction in older men.

TI  - Susceptibility to mice and potential evolutionary characteristics of porcinedeltacoronavirus.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28048 [doi]
AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes diarrhoea in suckling piglets and has the potential for cross-species transmission, posing athreat to animal and human health. However, the susceptibility profile ofdifferent species of mice to PDCoV infection and its evolutionary characteristicsare still unclear. In current study, we identified that BALB/c and Kunming miceare susceptible to PDCoV. Our results showed that there were obvious lesions inintestinal and lung tissues from the infected mice. PDCoV RNAs were detected inthe lung, kidney and intestinal tissues from the infected mice of both strains,and there existed wider tissue tropism in the PDCoV-infected BALB/c mice. The RNAand protein levels of aminopeptidase N from mice (mAPN) were relatively high inthe kidney and intestinal tissues and obviously increased after PDCoV infection. The viral specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against PDCoV were detected inserum from the infected mice. An interesting finding was that, two key amino acidmutations D138H and Q641K in the S protein were identified from thePDCoV-infected mice. The essential roles of these two mutations forPDCoV-adaptive evolution were confirmed by cryo-EM structure model analysis. The evolutionary characteristics of PDCoV among Deltacoronaviruses (delta-CoVs) were further analyzed. delta-CoVs from multiple mammals are closely related based onthe phylogenetic analysis. The codon usage analysis demonstrated similar codonusage patterns were used by most of the mammalian delta-CoVs at the global codon usage, synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels. These results mayprovide more insights into the evolution, host ranges and the cross speciespotential of PDCoV. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, an argon plasma jet was made for therapeutic purposes. Althoughcold plasma jet (CAPJ) is considered a safe device, its risk assessment isessential to be approved for a clinical trial. To this end, the safety parametersof the CAPJ were evaluated from both aspects associated with the instrument such as design, construction, and environmental conditions, and also function onliving organisms. It was shown that the device is physically safe for the userand the animal. In continue, healthy rats were treated by the plasma at two modesof streamer and plume mode at two distances of 20 and 25 mm from the nozzle for2, 5, and 10 minutes of exposure time. In the study of blood serum biochemistry, the strongest deviation from the average is observed at alkaline phosphatase inthe plume mode in the 10min (P10) group. Also, the amount of Aspartatetransaminase (AST) in the blood serum of rats is lower than the control group forall groups except streamer mode at 10 min exposure (S10). And, the mean ALTenzyme in the serum of the S5 group is significantly higher compared to the plumemode in the 5 min (P5) group. The histopathology of the liver is studied tosupport these results. Shrinkage of the nucleus, cell swelling, and hyperemia areobserved in the liver tissue for streamer mode, while in the plasma plume mode,these changes are not tangible. No significant difference is observed in the meanvalue of total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Albumin, Na, and K factors in thedifferent groups after the plasma treatment and the histopathology of kidneytissue is performed for all the groups to support this conclusion and it did not show any damage to the kidney tissue. As a result of risk assessment in thisstudy, the treatment with a duration of 2 to 5 minutes is safe with thespecifically designed CAPJ nozzle head at a distance of 25 mm from the nozzle.

AB  - The 2021 Annual Safety Pharmacology (SP) Society (SPS) meeting was held virtuallyOctober 4-8, 2021 due to the continuing COVID-19 global pandemic. This themedissue of J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods comprises articles arising from the meeting.As in previous years the manuscripts reflect various areas of innovation in SPincluding a perspective on aging and its impact on drug attrition during safetyassessments, an integrated assessment of respiratory, cardiovascular and animalactivity of in vivo nonclinical studies, development of a dynamic QT-ratecorrection method in primates, evaluation of the "comprehensive in vitroproarrhythmia assay" (CiPA) ion channel protocol to the automated patch clamp,and best practices regarding the conduct of hERG electrophysiology studies and ananalysis of secondary pharmacology assays by the FDA. The meeting also generated 85 abstracts (reproduced in the current volume of J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods).It appears that the validation of methods remains a challenge in SP.Nevertheless, the continued efforts to mine approaches to detection ofproarrhythmia liability remains a baffling obsession given the ability ofIndustry to completely prevent drugs entering into clinical study only to befound to have proarrhythmic properties, with no reports of such for at least ten years. Perhaps it is time to move on from CiPA and find genuine problems tosolve?

AB  - Iprodione is a well-known fungicide used in the cultivation of strawberries,tomatoes, grapes, and green beans. In recent studies, neurotoxicity,cardiotoxicity, and endocrine toxicity of iprodione have been reported. Although reproductive toxicity of iprodione has been identified in animal studies, itseffects are limited to male fertility. Also, the toxic effects of iprodione onpregnancy, especially the implantation process, have not been elucidated. Thisstudy demonstrated a series of cytotoxic responses of iprodione along with thealteration of implantation-related gene expression in porcine trophectoderm (pTr)and luminal epithelium (pLE) cells. In this study, iprodione suppressed cellviability, proliferation, and migration of these cells. Iprodione induced G1phase arrest and attenuated spheroid formation by pTr and pLE cells. Furthermore,iprodione caused mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive reactive oxygen species generation, which resulted in an increase in mitochondrial calcium levels.Consequently, DNA damage and apoptotic cell death were induced by iprodionetreatment in pTr and pLE cells. This stress-induced cell death was mediated byalterations in intracellular signal transduction, including the PI3K/AKT and MAPKsignaling pathways. This finding suggests the potential of iprodione to impairthe implantation capacity by exerting cytotoxic effects on fetal and maternalcells.

TI  - Bone marrow Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) for a (212)Pb-labeledanti-HER2/neu antibody.

AB  - PURPOSE: We have determined the in vivo relative biological effectiveness (RBE)of an alpha-particle emitting radiopharmaceutical therapeutic (alphaRPT) agent((212)Pb-labeled anti-HER-2/neu antibody) for the bone marrow, a potentiallydose-limiting normal tissue. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The RBE was measured in mice using femur marrow cellularity as the biological endpoint. External beamradiotherapy (EBRT), delivered by a small animal radiation research platform was used as the reference radiation. Alpha-particle emissions were delivered by(212)Bi, following the decay of its parent nuclide (212)Pb, conjugated onto ananti-HER2/neu antibody. The alpha-particle absorbed dose to the marrow following intravenously administered (tail vein) 122.1-921.3 kBq (212)Pb-TCMC-7.16.4 wascalculated. Mice were sacrificed at 0-7 days post-treatment (dpt) and femur bone marrow was counted for radioactivity. Changes in marrow cellularity were assessedby histopathology. RESULTS: The dose-response for EBRT and (212)Pb-anti-HER2/neu antibody were linear-quadratic and linear, respectively. By transforming the EBRTdose-response relationship into a linear relationship using the EQD2 formalism weobtained an RBE (denoted RBE2) of 6.4; this value is independent of cellularityand absorbed dose. CONCLUSIONS: Since hematologic toxicity is dose-limiting inalmost all antibody-based RPT, in vivo measurements of RBE are important inhelping identify an initial administered activity (AA) in phase 1 escalationtrials. Applying the RBE2 and assuming typical antibody clearance kinetics(Biological half-life of 48 h) with a modified blood-based dosimetry method, anaverage AA of approximately 185.5 MBq (5.0 mCi) per patient could be administeredbefore hematologic toxicity is anticipated.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of supplementing feed with arazyme and dietarycarbohydrolases derived from invertebrate gut-associated symbionts on the noxiousgas emissions, gut microbiota, and host-microbiome interactions of pigs. Here,270 and 260 growing pigs were assigned to control and treatment groups,respectively. The tested feed additives contained a mixture of arazyme (2,500,000Unit/kg) and synergetic enzymes, xylanase (200,000 Unit/kg) and mannanase(200,000 Unit/kg), derived from insect gut-associated symbionts in a 7.5:1:1ratio. The control group was fed a basal diet and the treatment group was fed thebasal diet supplemented with 0.1% enzyme mixture (v/v) for 2months. Odorous gaseswere monitored in ventilated air from tested houses. Fecal samples were collectedfrom steel plate under the cage at the completion of the experiment to determine chemical composition, odor emissions, and bacterial communities. There was asignificant decrease in the concentration of NH3 (22.5 vs. 11.2ppm; P<0.05), H2S (7.35 vs. 3.74ppm; P<0.05), trimethylamine (TMA) (0.066 vs. 0.001ppm; P<0.05),and p-cresol (0.004ppm vs. 0ppm; P<0.05) at 56 d in treatment group compared withthe control group. Moreover, fecal analysis results showed that exogenous enzyme supplementation caused a reduction in VFAs and indole content with approximately >60% and 72.7%, respectively. The result of gas emission analysis showed that NH3(9.9 vs. 5.3ppm; P<0.05) and H2S (5.8 vs. 4.1ppm; P<0.05) were significantlyreduced in the treatment group compared to the control group. The gut microbiota of the treatment group differed significantly from that of the control group, andthe treatment group altered predicted metabolic pathways, including sulfur andnitrogen related metabolism, urea degradation. The results demonstrated thatsupplementing feed with arazyme with dietary carbohydrolases effectively controlsnoxious gas emissions and improves health and meat quality of pigs.

AB  - In its climate protection law, Germany pursues the aim of achieving greenhousegas neutrality by 2045. To approach this aim, the emissions from all sectorsshall be reduced by 65% by 2030 relative to 1990 and this includes mitigation of enteric methane (CH4) emissions from livestock. The enteric CH4 emission ratemust be reduced to 853kt CH4 by 2030, but if this target rate reaches the levelof the pre-agroindustrial era remains to be evaluated. The present study aimed todetermine enteric CH4 emission factors, emission rates and intensities forGermany in the 19th century. Historical data about animal numbers in the GermanEmpire were normalized to Germany's current territory. Body weight andperformance data of livestock were available for 1883 and 1892. By using Tier 1and Tier 2 approaches we found that oxen and bulls had the greatest emissionfactors, followed by dairy cows and young cattle. The annual enteric CH4emissions from livestock amounted to 898kt in 1883 and 1061kt in 1892. Thus, the 2030-emission target is set 45kt below the emission level of 1883, and livestock in Germany has been emitting comparable amounts or less enteric CH4 since 2003relative to 1892. Animal performance increased, and while CH4 emissionintensities for meat and milk production decreased from 1883 to 1892, thesevalues were higher than values from 1991 to 2020. Although the human populationof Germany's current territory more than doubled in the last 130years, increased gain in animal performance allowed for the reduction in the numbers of ruminants at least during the last 35years, resulting in declining CH4 emissions. Such astrategy may also be applied by other countries with steadily increasing humanpopulations to balance CH4 emissions and food production from livestock.

AB  - AIMS: Several studies have linked gut microbes to human diseases. Most of themechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria have beneficial effects on the humanbody are related to immune modulation. Controlled studies of the ability oflactic acid bacteria to absorb phosphorus directly from the intestine and therebycontrol serum phosphorus level in in vivo uremic animal models are limited.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened lactic acid bacteria living in Koreanfermented foods to identify those that absorb the most phosphorus and notedLactiplantibacillus paraplantarum KCCM 11826P. The mechanism through which betterintracellular absorption of phosphorus occurs in this strain was studied usinggenomic DNA sequencing. After the strain was administered to 5/6 nephrectomizedrats for 6weeks, it was observed whether hyperphosphatemia had improved. KEYFINDINGS: The L. paraplantarum KCCM 11826P strain has a polyP gene cluster; thus,it absorbs phosphorus better than other bacteria and can suppress strains thatproduce indole. Supplementing the diets of 5/6 nephrectomized rats with this L.paraplantarum strain significantly decreased serum phosphate level (by 22%) andreduced blood indoxyl sulphate concentration (by 40%) compared with vehicletreatment. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that Lactiplantibacilluspreparations can be used for multiple purposes, such as the removal of phosphorusand uremic toxins from patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This studyalso demonstrates the novel concept of a probiotic phosphate binder.

AB  - Cannabinoid diphenol (CBD) is a non-toxic main component extracted from cannabis,which has the effects of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and anti-oxidativestress. In recent years, exercise-induced myocardial injury has become a researchhotspot in the field of sports medicine and sports physiology. Exercise-inducedmyocardial injury is closely related to oxidative stress, inflammatory responseand apoptosis. However, there is no clear evidence of the relationship betweenCBD and exercise-induced myocardial injury. In this study, by establishing ananimal model of exhaustive exercise training in mice, the protective effect ofCBD on myocardial injury in mice was elaborated, and the possible molecularmechanism was discussed. After CBD intervention, the arrangement and rupture ofmyocardial fiber tissue and the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration werereduced, the deposition of collagen fibers in myocardial tissue decreased. CBDcan also significantly inhibit cardiac hypertrophy. Meanwhile, the expression of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, Bax, Caspase-3, Bcl-2, MDA-5, IRE-1alpha, NOX-2, SOD-1,Keap1, Nrf2, HO-1, NF-kappaB and COX-2 was recovered to normal. In addition,after CBD intervention, the protein expression of Keap1 was down-regulated, thetranslocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was significantlyincreased, then the transcriptional activity was increased, and the expression ofthe downstream HO-1 antioxidant protein was increased, indicating that CBD mayimprove the cardiac function of exhaustive exercise training mice by activatingKeap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Molecular docking results also confirmed that CBD had a good binding effect with Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway proteins. Inconclusion, the protective mechanism of CBD on myocardial injury in exhaustiveexercise training mice may be to activate Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, and then exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and inhibition of oxidative stress.

AB  - The centromere represents a single region in most eukaryotic chromosomes.However, several plant and animal lineages assemble holocentromeres along theentire chromosome length. Here, we compare genome organization and evolution as afunction of centromere type by assembling chromosome-scale holocentric genomeswith repeat-based holocentromeres from three beak-sedge (Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis) and their closest monocentric relative, Juncuseffusus. We demonstrate that transition to holocentricity affected 3D genomearchitecture by redefining genomic compartments, while distributing centromerefunction to thousands of repeat-based centromere units genome-wide. We uncover a complex genome organization in R. pubera that hides its unexpected octoploidy anddescribe a marked reduction in chromosome number for R. tenuis, which has onlytwo chromosomes. We show that chromosome fusions, facilitated by repeat-basedholocentromeres, promoted karyotype evolution and diploidization. Our study thus sheds light on several important aspects of genome architecture and evolutioninfluenced by centromere organization.

AB  - Oakleaf butterflies in the genus Kallima have a polymorphic wing phenotype,enabling these insects to masquerade as dead leaves. This iconic example ofprotective resemblance provides an interesting evolutionary paradigm that can be employed to study biodiversity. We integrated multi-omic data analyses andfunctional validation to infer the evolutionary history of Kallima species andinvestigate the genetic basis of their variable leaf wing patterns. We find that Kallima butterflies diversified in the eastern Himalayas and dispersed to Eastand Southeast Asia. Moreover, we find that leaf wing polymorphism is controlledby the wing patterning gene cortex, which has been maintained in Kallima bylong-term balancing selection. Our results provide macroevolutionary andmicroevolutionary insights into a model species originating from a mountainecosystem.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an important micronutrient that is not readily available topathogens during infection. Hosts resist the invasion of pathogens throughnutritional immunity and oxidative stress. To overcome this nutrient restriction,bacteria utilize high affinity transporters to compete with nutrient-bindingproteins (e.g., calprotectin). Little is known about the role of Mn in thepathophysiology of Streptococcus suis. Here, we revealed that the tolerance of S.suis to calprotectin and oxidative stress was associated with Mn. Inactivation ofMn uptake system, TroABCD, in S. suis decreased the tolerance to calprotectin andoxidative stress. Furthermore, Mn uptake system mutant strains reduced capacityfor bacterial cellular survival, and attenuated virulence in a mouse model. Toexplore the regulatory mechanism, we determined the transcriptional start site oftroABCD using capping rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Furthermore, we revealed that TroR was a transcriptional regulatory repressor of troABCD. In the absenceof troR, transcription levels of troA, troB, troC, and troD were not inhibited bylow or high Mn levels, and intracellular Mn contents of mutant strains werehigher than that of the wild-type strain. Finally, we used electrophoreticmobility shift assay to demonstrate that TroR bound the promoter region oftroABCD. Collectively, this study revealed that Mn acquisition was essential for pathogenesis of S. suis and Mn uptake systems should be targets for thedevelopment of new antimicrobials.

AB  - Dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR; Clec4a2), a member of the C-type lectinreceptor family, plays important roles in homeostasis of the immune and bonesystems. However, the intestinal role of this molecule is unclear. Here, we show that dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane-DSS-inducedintestinal tumors are reduced in Clec4a2(-/-) mice independently of intestinalmicrobiota. STAT5 phosphorylation and expression of Csf2 and tight junction genesare enhanced, while Il17a and Cxcl2 are suppressed in the Clec4a2(-/-) mousecolon, which exhibits reduced infiltration of neutrophils and myeloid-derivedsuppressor cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)administration ameliorates DSS colitis associated with reduced Il17a and enhancedtight junction gene expression, whereas anti-GM-CSF exacerbates symptoms.Furthermore, anti-NA2, a ligand for DCIR, ameliorates colitis and preventscolorectal tumors. These observations indicate that blocking DCIR signalingameliorates colitis and suppresses colonic tumors, suggesting DCIR as a possible target for the treatment of these diseases.

AB  - Large-scale coal mining activities on the QTP have affected the natural grasslandecosystem which will take decades to recover. Therefore, looking for an effectivevegetation restoration method is the most effective way to restore the ecosystem.In this study, we explored the effects of three vegetation restoration modes(coal mine spoils planting (CK), organic fertilizer planting (OF), and cover soilplanting (CS)) on the five cold-resistance related physiological indices of threenative Gramineae plants (Elymus nutans, Poa crymophila and Festuca sinensis)growing in three different habitats (shady slope, sunny slope, and flat slope).The higher contents of soluble sugar (SS) in the Elymus nutans (213.46 mg/g) and Festuca sinensis (202.84 mg/g) were recorded under the CS treatment in the sunny slope habitat. The FP contents of Elymus nutans (421.31 mug/g), Poa crymophila(310.06 mug/g), and Festuca sinens (288.45 mug/g) were higher under the CKtreatment in the flat ground habitat. The higher (P < 0.05) content ofchlorophyll (Chl) was recorded in the Elymus nutans (2.13 mg/g) under the CStreatment in the sunny slope habitat compared to the other two plants. Weobserved lower MDA contents in the Elymus nutans (3.19 nmol/g) and Festucasinensis (3.56 nmol/g) under the CK treatment growing in the shady slope habitat.In the shady slope habitat, the H2O2 contents of Elymus nutans (15.86 mumol/g),Poa crymophila (6.78 mumol/g), and Festuca sinensis (8.76 mumol/g) under the CStreatment were significantly lower compared to other treatments. Based onmembership function method, the low-temperature adaptability order of the threerestoration plants from strong to weak was Elymus nutans > Festuca sinensis > Poacrymophila. While the effectiveness order of the three vegetation restorationmodels in alpine mining areas from good to bad was CS > OF > CK. This study will provide a theoretical and guiding significance to evaluate the effectiveness ofdifferent restoration methods, formulate optimal restoration strategies and guidethe sustainable restoration of the damaged ecosystems of the alpine mining areas.

AB  - 4-tert-butylphenol (4-tBP) is a toxic environmental pollutant with moderatebioaccumulation, environmental persistence, and long-term toxicity. Its toxicity to aquatic organisms has become an issue of concern. However, the molecularmechanism of 4-tBP toxicity to aquatic organisms remained unclear. Liver is atarget organ for environmental pollutants. Here, we established 4-tBP-exposedtoxicity model in vivo and primary hepatocyte model in vitro in common carp(Cyprinus carpio L.). We found increased hepatic-somatic index (HSI) and abnormalserum biochemical indexes (ALT, AST, and LDH) after 4-tBP exposure, indicatingliver damage. We further revealed that 4-tBP damaged the structural integrity of the livers with typical features of ferroptosis. Based on toxicogenomicsanalysis, we found ferroptosis is likely to be involved in the mechanism of4-tBP-induced liver damage. Moreover, our in vivo and in vitro experimentprovided evidences that 4-tBP-exposure led to excess oxidative stress, ironoverload, decreased MMP, and abnormal expression of ferroptosis-related factors. Interestingly, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor) pretreatmentalleviated above changes. In summary, we demonstrated that 4-tBP triggeredhepatocytes ferroptosis via oxidative stress, iron overload, SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4axis, and ATF4/HSPA5/GPX4 axis. For the first time, we discovered that Fer-1 can ameliorate the toxicity of 4-tBP, which needs more investigations. Our resultsprovided a scientific basis of molecular mechanism of 4-tBP-induced fishpoisoning.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop dry heat processing conditions that couldachieve a >5-log reduction of Salmonella with minimal negative impact on almondquality. The effects of almond's water activity (aw) levels and packaging methodson Salmonella inactivation by dry heat were determined. Almonds weredip-inoculated in a four-strain Salmonella cocktail and conditioned to aw of0.43, 0.33, 0.23, and 0.20. The inoculated almonds were then placed invacuum-sealed mylar bags (vacuum packaging), ambient-sealed glass tubes(non-vacuum packaging), and petri dishes without covers (no packaging). Thepackaged and un-packaged almonds were treated by dry heat with 13 % relativehumidity at 73 degrees C. Vacuum packaging in general achieved slightly better(in some cases significantly better (p < 0.05)) or similar inactivation effect onSalmonella than non-vacuum packaging. Both vacuum and non-vacuum packagingmethods achieved much greater Salmonella inactivation than the no packagingmethod. For example, a 4-h treatment at 73 degrees C reduced Salmonella onalmonds with aw of 0.43 by 5.1-, 4.4-, and 1.3-log for mylar bag, tube, and petridish, respectively. Higher aw levels resulted in better inactivation ofSalmonella. To achieve a >4-log reduction of Salmonella on almonds packaged inmylar bags, 3-, 6-, 8-, and 8-h of heat treatment were needed for almonds with awvalues of 0.43, 0.33, 0.23 and 0.20, respectively. Vacuum packaging incombination with a 4-h heat treatment of almonds with initial aw of 0.43 or 8-hheat treatment of almonds with initial aw of 0.33 could achieved a >/=5-logreduction of Salmonella. Those two combinations resulted in very little weightloss (</=0.05 %), insignificant color change (E </= 1.26), and unnoticeablechange in visual appearance of almonds, demonstrating that they could bepotentially used for raw almond pasteurization.

AB  - Poultry meat and eggs are a primary source of animal protein. To meet the market needs, high yield laying hens are reared continuously, resulting in quick ovaryaging. Thus, we investigated the anti-aging effects of Shudi Erzi San (SES) onlaying hens. Sixty 300-day-old laying hens were divided into 2 experimentalgroups and a control group. The control group was fed on a basic diet, which was supplemented with 1% and 2% SES for experimental groups I and II, respectively.Egg quality and changes in serum hormones and blood-biochemical indicators oflaying hens were determined. The rate of egg production was significantly higher in group than in both the control and group by 9.29 and 8.22 percentage points,respectively (P < 0.05). Eggshell strength of groups and were significantlyhigher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). Albumen height and Haugh Units of group were significantly higher than those of the control (P < 0.05). Serumlevels of follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol in group were significantly higher than those of both the control and group (P < 0.05), whereas groups andhad significantly higher serum levels of luteinizing hormone than the control (P < 0.05). Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) did not significantly differbetween the control and group (P > 0.05), but SOD and malondialdehyde (MDA)levels in group were significantly higher and lower, respectively (P < 0.05) whencompared to the control. Compared with the control, uric acid levels in groupsand were significantly lower (P < 0.05), as was urea nitrogen in group (P <0.05). Transcriptome and KEGG pathway analysis of ovarian tissues of laying hens showed a significant immune related signal pathway as the possible main regulatorof a lysosome related signal pathway. Thus, supplementing chicken feed with SESimproves egg production and quality and alleviates ovarian decline in layinghens.

AB  - Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) is a chronic hepatic disease which occurswhen there is a disorder in lipid metabolism. FLHS is often observed in cagedlaying hens and characterized by a decrease in egg production and dramaticincrease of mortality. Salidroside (SDS) is an herbal drug which has shownnumerous pharmacological activities, such as protecting mitochondrial function,attenuating cell apoptosis and inflammation, and promoting antioxidant defensesystem. We aimed to determine the therapeutic effects of SDS on FLHS in layinghens and investigate the underlying mechanisms through which SDS operates thesefunctions. We constructed oleic acid (OA)-induced fatty liver model in vitro and high-fat diet-induced FLHS of laying hens in vivo. The results indicated that SDSinhibited OA-induced lipid accumulation in chicken primary hepatocytes, increasedhepatocyte activity, elevated the mRNA expression of proliferation related genes PCNA, CDK2, and cyclinD1 and increased the protein levels of PCNA and CDK2 (P <0.05), as well as decreased the cleavage levels of Caspase-9, Caspase-8, andCaspase-3 and apoptosis in hepatocytes (P < 0.05). Moreover, SDS promoted thephosphorylation levels of PDK1, AKT, and Gsk3-beta, while inhibited the PI3Kinhibitor (P < 0.05). Additionally, we found that high-fat diet-induced FLHS henshad heavier body weight, liver weight, and abdominal fat weight, and severesteatosis in histology, compared with the control group (Con). However, hens fed with SDS maintained lighter body weight, liver weight, and abdominal fat weight, as well as normal liver without hepatic steatosis. In addition, high-fatdiet-induced FLHS hens had high levels of serum total cholesterol (TC),triglyceride (TG), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) compared to the Con group, however, in the Model+SDS group, the levels ofTC, TG, ALT, and AST decreased significantly, whereas the level of superoxidedismutase (SOD) increased significantly (P < 0.05). We also found that SDSsignificantly decreased the mRNA expression abundance of PPARgamma, SCD, and FAS in the liver, as well as increased levels of PPARalpha and MTTP, and decreasedthe mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in the Model+SDS group(P < 0.05). In summary, this study showed that 0.3 mg/mL SDS attenuated ROSgeneration, inhibited lipid accumulation and hepatocyte apoptosis, and promotedhepatocyte proliferation by targeting the PI3K/AKT/Gsk3-beta pathway inOA-induced fatty liver model in vitro, and 20 mg/kg SDS alleviatedhigh-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatoryresponse in laying hens in vivo.

AB  - Recently, developing countries have focused on using innovative feed in poultrynutrition. The plant Moringa oleifera is native to India but grows worldwide intropical and subtropical climates. Moringa is planted on a large scale as it can tolerate severe dry and cold conditions. All parts of this plant can be used for commercial or nutritional purposes, and it has a favorable nutritional profile.Beneficial phytochemicals, minerals, and vitamins are abundant in the leaves. Theleaf extracts can be used to treat malnutrition; they also possess anticancer,antioxidant, antidiabetic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties.Further, moringa contains antinutritional substances, such as trypsin inhibitors,phytates, tannins, oxalates, cyanide, and saponins, which have a harmful effecton mineral and protein metabolism. Previous research suggested that includingmoringa in chicken diets boosts their growth and productivity. Therefore, thisreview focuses on the characterization and application of M. oleifera in poultry nutrition and its potential toxicity. Furthermore, we discuss the nutritionalcontent, phytochemicals, and antioxidants of M. oleifera leaf meal and itsapplicability in poultry rations.

AB  - In tsetse-infested areas of Ethiopia, African Animal Trypanosomiasis is the most serious threat to livestock productivity. A cross-sectional study was conductedfrom May 2021 to September 2021 in the Zaba Gazo district to assess theprevalence and associated risk factors of bovine trypanosomiasis throughparasitological and hematological techniques. In the current study, the overallprevalence of trypanosomiasis was found to be 21%. Among anticipated riskfactors, the origin of animals has shown a statistically significant association (p < 0.05) with the occurrence of bovine trypanosomiasis. Other potential riskfactors, such as sex, age, BCS, coat color, and agroecology, were not shown tohave a statistically significant relationship (p > 0.05) with trypanosomiasis.The overall mean PCV values for parasitaemic and aparasitaemic cattle were 23.24 +/- 3.04SD and 27.37 +/- 4.18SD, respectively, thus it was lower in parasitaemic animals than the aparasitaemic animals. A high prevalence of bovinetrypanosomiasis in the study area necessitates an integrated parasite and vector control approach to curve the prevalence and effect of the disease.

AB  - The immunomodulatory function of natural active ingredients has long been a focusof scientific research, with recent hotspots reporting targeted modulation of thefollicular helper T cells (Tfh)/regulatory T cells (Treg) balance as an emerging strategy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, dextran sodiumsulfate induced mice UC and Astragalus polysaccharide (APS, 200 mg/kg/day) wasadministered simultaneously. In this study, APS effectively alleviated colitis inmice by improving survival rate, disease activity index (DAI), the change rate ofbody weight, colonic length and weight, and histopathological injury of thecolon. Moreover, APS regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokinesinterleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, andtransforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in colonic tissues of colitis mice.Importantly, APS significantly downregulated Tfh cell and the expression of itsrelated nuclear transcription factors Blimp-1 and Bcl-6, and cytokine IL-21.Meanwhile, APS regulated the differentiation of Tfh subpopulations in colitismice, with Tfh10 and Tfr significantly upregulated while Tfh1, Tfh17, and Tfh21significantly downregulated. In addition, APS significantly upregulated Tregcells and the levels of its associated nuclear transcription factor Foxp3, andcytokine IL-10 in colitis mice. In conclusion, APS effectively alleviated UC byreshaping the balance of Tfh/Treg cells.

AB  - We estimated genetic parameters for two in vivo embryo production-relatedsuperovulatory response traits-total number of embryos and oocytes (TNE) andnumber of good embryos (NGE)-in Japanese Black donor cows through Bayesian count regression analysis. We used 20,257 records of superovulation treatments from1546 Japanese Black cows, with 1102 (5.4%) zero-count records for TNE and 3533(17.4%) for NGE. Two generalized mixed linear models (MLMs; repeatability animal models)-Poisson (POI) and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models-werefitted to the untransformed phenotypic records. A Gaussian MLM was also fitted tountransformed phenotypic records (GAU), natural log-transformed records (LOG),and records with Anscombe's variance stabilizing transformation (ANS). Theestimated heritabilities and repeatabilities of TNE were 0.30 and 0.43 by POI,0.35 and 0.47 by ZIP, 0.27 and 0.36 by GAU, 0.21 and 0.31 by LOG, and 0.24 and0.35 by ANS, respectively. Those of NGE were 0.29 and 0.36 by POI, 0.31 and 0.40 by ZIP, 0.18 and 0.25 by GAU, 0.19 and 0.24 by LOG, and 0.20 and 0.25 by ANS,respectively. Under the ZIP, the estimated heritabilities and repeatabilities of the probability of zero counts were 0.43 and 0.71 for TNE and 0.42 and 0.51 forNGE, respectively, and the rank correlations between estimated breeding values ofthe 1546 donor cows for superovulation response and those for the probability of zero count were around -0.40 for TNE and -0.50 for NGE.

TI  - Cadmium exposure induces autophagy via PLC-IP3 -IP3 R signaling pathway in duckrenal tubular epithelial cells.
LID - 10.1002/tox.23626 [doi]
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is detrimental to animals, but nephrotoxic effects of Cd on duckhave not been fully elucidated. To evaluate the impacts of Cd on Ca homeostasisand autophagy via PLC-IP3 -IP3 R pathway, primary duck renal tubular epithelialcells were exposed to 2.5 muM and 5.0 muM Cd, and combination of 5.0 muM Cd and10.0 muM 2-APB or 0.125 muM U-73122 for 12 h (U-73122 pretreated for 1 h). These results evidenced that Cd induced [Ca(2+) ]c overload mainly came fromintracellular Ca store. Cd caused [Ca(2+) ]mit and [Ca(2+) ]c overload with[Ca(2+) ]ER decrease, elevated Ca homeostasis related factors (GRP78, GRP94, CRT,CaN, CaMKII, and CaMKKbeta) expression, PLC and IP3 activities and IP3 Rexpression, but subcellular Ca(2+) redistribution was reversed by 2-APB. PLCinhibitor U-73122 dramatically relieved the changes of the above indicatorsinduced by Cd. Additionally, U-73122 obviously reduced the number ofautophagosomes and LC3 accumulation spots, Atg5, LC3A, LC3B mRNA levels andLC3II/LC3I, Beclin-1 protein levels induced by Cd, and markedly elevated p62 mRNAand protein levels. Overall, the results verified that Cd induced [Ca(2+) ]coverload mainly originated from ER Ca(2+) release mediated by PLC-IP3 -IP3 Rpathway, then triggered autophagy in duck renal tubular epithelial cells.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010623 [doi]
AB  - Countermeasures against Zika virus (ZIKV), including vaccines, are frequentlytested in nonhuman primates (NHP). Macaque models are important for understandinghow ZIKV infections impact human pregnancy due to similarities in placentaldevelopment. The lack of consistent adverse pregnancy outcomes in ZIKV-affectedpregnancies poses a challenge in macaque studies where group sizes are oftensmall (4-8 animals). Studies in small animal models suggest that African-lineage Zika viruses can cause more frequent and severe fetal outcomes. No adverseoutcomes were observed in macaques exposed to 1x104 PFU (low dose) ofAfrican-lineage ZIKV at gestational day (GD) 45. Here, we exposed eight pregnant rhesus macaques to 1x108 PFU (high dose) of African-lineage ZIKV at GD 45 to testthe hypothesis that adverse pregnancy outcomes are dose-dependent. Three of eightpregnancies ended prematurely with fetal death. ZIKV was detected in both fetaland placental tissues from all cases of early fetal loss. Further refinements of this exposure system (e.g., varying the dose and timing of infection) could lead to an even more consistent, unambiguous fetal loss phenotype for assessing ZIKVcountermeasures in pregnancy. These data demonstrate that high-dose exposure toAfrican-lineage ZIKV causes pregnancy loss in macaques and also suggest thatZIKV-induced first trimester pregnancy loss could be strain-specific.

AB  - Grasslands, which constitute almost 40% of the terrestrial biosphere, providehabitat for a great diversity of animals and plants and contribute to thelivelihoods of more than 1 billion people worldwide. Whereas the destruction and degradation of grasslands can occur rapidly, recent work indicates that complete recovery of biodiversity and essential functions occurs slowly or not at all.Grassland restoration-interventions to speed or guide this recovery-has received less attention than restoration of forested ecosystems, often due to theprevailing assumption that grasslands are recently formed habitats that canreassemble quickly. Viewing grassland restoration as long-term assembly towardold-growth endpoints, with appreciation of feedbacks and threshold shifts, willbe crucial for recognizing when and how restoration can guide recovery of thisglobally important ecosystem.

TI  - Effect of peri-conception high fat diets on maternal ovarian function, fetal and placentome growth, and vascular umbilical development in goats.
LID - 10.1111/rda.14224 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether a high-fat diet (HFD) fed togoats for a brief period during peri-conception would optimize reproductive andfetal responses. Thirty-four Anglo-Nubian crossbred adult goats were allocatedinto three groups: control (n = 11), fed with a total mixed ration (TMR) based onchopped elephant grass and concentrate; HFBM (n = 11), given TMR supplementedwith soybean oil on a 0.5% dry matter basis for 11 days starting nine days beforemating (BM); and HFAM (n = 12), fed with soybean oil included in the TMR for 15days after mating (AM). The TMR diets differed in their fat content (7.5% vs.2.9%). All goats had estrus synchronized for 14 days BM by intravaginaladministration of 60 mg MPA sponge for 12 days. Forty-eight hours BM, the sponge was removed and 0.075 mg PGF2alpha was applied intramuscularly. After 36 hours, 1mL GnRH was administered intramuscularly, and goats were mated after spongeremoval. The fat groups showed lower feed intake (P < 0.001) and highercholesterol levels (P < 0.001) when HFD was administered. Doppler and B-modeultrasound evaluations revealed a greater (P < 0.05) number of small (< 3 mm, 10 +/- 0.6 vs 8 +/- 0.5) and large (>/= 3 mm, 6 +/- 0.4 vs 5.0 +/- 0.2) folliclesand intraovarian blood area (P < 0.05) in the HFBM group during sponge removal(57.6%) and mating (24.2%) than those of the no-fat group. During AM, the fat-fedgroups exhibited higher glutathione peroxidase levels (P < 0.05) and a reduction (P < 0.001) in corpus luteum size (19%) and vascularized Doppler area (41%). Nodifference (P > 0.05) between groups was found in fetal traits, placentome, andumbilical vascular development, except for the embryonic vesicle where HFAM twin pregnancy showed a smaller size than the control (26.1 +/- 3.5 cm vs 33.7 +/- 2.7cm; P < 0.01). Thus, HFD applied during peri-conception of goats has no impact onlater fetal development but improved the follicular growth when given before the mating. Thus the use of HFD in periconception has no impact on fetal development but increases follicular growth before breeding time.

TI  - Unusual bromine enrichment in the gastric mill and setae of the hadal amphipodHirondellea gigas.
PG  - e0272032
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272032 [doi]
AB  - The hadal amphipod Hirondellea gigas is an emblematic animal of the Pacifictrenches, and has a number of special adaptations to thrive in this 'extreme'environment, which includes the deepest part of the Earth's ocean. One suchadaptation that has been suggested is the presence of an 'aluminum gel shield' onthe surface of its body in order to prevent the dissolution of calciticexoskeleton below the carbonate compensation depth. However, this has not beeninvestigated under experimental conditions that sufficiently prevent aluminumartefacts, and the possibility of other elements with similar characteristicX-ray energy as aluminum (such as bromine) has not been considered. Here, we showwith new electron microscopy data gathered under optimized conditions to minimizealuminum artefacts that H. gigas actually does not have an aluminumshield-instead many parts of its body are enriched in bromine, particularlygastric ossicles and setae. Results from elemental analyses pointed to the use ofcalcite partially substituted with magnesium by H. gigas in its exoskeleton, inorder to suppress dissolution. Our results exemplify the necessity of carefulsample preparation and analysis of the signals in energy-dispersive X-rayspectroscopic analysis, and the importance of analyses at different electronenergies.

AB  - The existing variation among pea protein isolates' functionality limits theirapplication in food formulations. The source and extent of variations amongyellow pea protein profiles was assessed in 10 single seeds of two varieties withdifferent size and weight. A new approach was developed to analyze proteins ofyellow pea combining three analytical methods of size exclusion chromatography(SEC), reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), andmicrofluidic SDS-PAGE, to achieve the highest separation resolution. A highvariation of protein concentration was observed not only between varieties, butalso among seeds of the same variety. Vicilin to legumin ratio was between2.72-4.19, and 1.70-2.22 among the individual seeds of AC Agassiz and CDC Saffronvarieties, respectively. V/L ratio was significantly different among theindividual seeds for both varieties. The amount of some proteinfractions/subunits were correlated with seeds' size and weight for AC Agassiz,while such correlations were not observed for CDC Saffron.

TI  - Outbreaks of Acute Gastrointestinal Illness Associated with a Splash Pad in aWildlife Park - Kansas, June 2021.
PG  - 981-987
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7131a1 [doi]
AB  - In June 2021, Kansas state and county public health officials identified andinvestigated three cases of shigellosis (a bacterial diarrheal illness caused by Shigella spp.) associated with visiting a wildlife park. The park has animalexhibits and a splash pad. Two affected persons visited animal exhibits, and all three entered the splash pad. Nonhuman primates are the only known animalreservoir of Shigella. The splash pad, which sprays water on users and isdesigned so that water does not collect in the user area, was closed on June 19. The state and county public health codes do not include regulations for splashpads. Thus, these venues are not typically inspected, and environmental healthexpertise is limited. A case-control study identified two distinct outbreaksassociated with the park (a shigellosis outbreak involving 21 cases and asubsequent norovirus infection outbreak involving six cases). Shigella andnorovirus can be transmitted by contaminated water; in both outbreaks, illnesswas associated with getting splash pad water in the mouth (multiply imputedadjusted odds ratio [aORMI] = 6.4, p = 0.036; and 28.6, p = 0.006, respectively).Maintaining adequate water disinfection and environmental health expertise andtargeting prevention efforts to caregivers of splash pad users help preventsplash pad-associated outbreaks. Outbreak incidence might be further reduced whenU.S. jurisdicitons voluntarily adopt CDC's Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC)recommendations and through the prevention messages: "Don't get in the water ifsick with diarrhea," "Don't stand or sit above the jets," and "Don't swallow the water."(dagger).

TI  - Tracking the Transmission of Antimicrobial-Resistant Non-O157 Escherichia coliand Salmonella Isolates at the Interface of Food Animals and Fresh Produce fromAgriculture Operations Using Whole-Genome Sequencing.
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2022.0016 [doi]
AB  - An increasing number of outbreaks are caused by foodborne pathogens such asEscherichia coli and Salmonella, which often harbor antimicrobial resistance(AMR) genes. We previously demonstrated the transmission of pathogens from animaloperations to produce fields on sustainable farms, which illustrated an urgentneed to develop and implement novel prevention methods and remediation practices such as the vegetative buffer zone (VBZ) to prevent this movement. The focus ofthis study was to use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize the AMR,virulence, and single-nucleotide polymorphism profile of 15 Salmonella and 128 E.coli isolates collected from small-scale dairy and poultry farms on a researchstation in North Carolina. Phenotypically, seven E. coli and three Salmonellaisolates displayed resistance to antibiotics such as tetracycline (n = 4),ampicillin (n = 4), nalidixic acid (n = 3), chloramphenicol (n = 2),sulfisoxazole (n = 1), and streptomycin (n = 1). A single E. coli isolate wasfound to be resistant to five different antibiotic class types and possessed the blaTEM-150 resistance gene. Virulence genes that facilitate toxin production and cell invasion were identified. Mauve analysis of the E. coli isolates identified seven clusters (dairy-six and poultry-one) indicating that transmission isoccurring from animal operations to fresh produce fields and the surroundingenvironment when the VBZ is denudated. This suggests that the VBZ is a usefulbarrier to reducing the transmission of enteric pathogens in agriculturalsystems. Our study demonstrates the prevalence of AMR and virulence genes onsmall-scale sustainable farms and highlights the advantage of using WGS to assessthe impact of the VBZ to reduce the transmission of E. coli and Salmonella.

AB  - There are significant numbers of transboundary shipments of live insects forpollination, pest management, industrial processes, research and other uses, but data collection and analysis have proved difficult. The World Organisation forAnimal Health and Collectif TIS (Technique de l'Insecte Sterile), a French think tank, carried out a stakeholder survey to understand the nature of the liveinsect trade and potential challenges to safety and efficiency. Targetrespondents had experience in the areas of biocontrol, sterile insect technique, entomological research and regulatory affairs. Although the survey was sentglobally, the responses were unintentionally biased towards Europe, whereinterest is high, since this region is developing a comprehensive framework topromote the use of beneficial insects to replace pesticides. The survey alsoexplored respondents' knowledge of several international agreements on themovement and risk management of beneficial or invasive insects. Knowledge of the various regulations was generally poor, and respondents highlighted a perceivedlack of clarity regarding live insect shipments in the existing internationalregulations and guidelines. Almost two-thirds of participants reported reluctanceby carriers to accept live insects for shipment, and three-quarters describedoccasional to systematic delays that resulted in a reduction of quality orviability. Some respondents reported that they instead hand-carry live insects,mostly in small quantities. Participants described being directly involved intrade covering 70 species of live insects and ticks transported among 37countries, with volumes ranging from fewer than ten insects to over a million pershipment. Of these, 30% were potential vectors of pathogens to humans or animals,42% were potential plant pest species (including some used for biocontrol), and17% were classical biocontrol agents. The results of this survey begin to define the current scope, scale and issues for those involved in shipping live insectsand ticks across political boundaries. The survey's aim is to persuade regulatorybodies and shipping operators to facilitate safety, efficiency and consistency inthis underdeveloped sector.

AB  - Insect breeding or farming for food and feed is an emerging enterprise that canaddress the ever-growing demand for protein and curb high unemployment rates inAfrica and beyond. However, for the sector to prosper, its value chain needs tobe regulated to ensure sustainability and safety for consumers and theenvironment. Although a few African countries, such as Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, have promulgated standards on the use of insects as food and feed, greaterefforts are needed in other countries, and relevant policies governing the sectorneed to be formulated. All over the globe, attention to the regulation of theedible insect sector is increasing, and more investment in the industry isforeseen. Safety issues such as identifying which species should be reared,substrate quality and traceability imposed by importing countries will becritical for expansion of the sector. This paper analyses safety, regulatory and environmental issues related to breeding and international trade of edibleinsects in Africa and provides case studies and recommendations for sustainableuse of insects for food and feed.

LID - 10.20506/rst.41.1.3310 [doi]
AB  - Japan imports a wide range of arthropods for industrial use and as companionanimals. Such imports may threaten ecosystems locally and in their regions oforigin. Two iconic insect imports that pose ecological problems are agricultural bumblebees and companion beetles. Colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestrishave contributed significantly to agricultural production since they were firstbrought to Japan in the 1990s. But, in their progressive feralisation, they harm populations of native bumblebees through competition, hybridisation, and theintroduction of parasites. They also threaten native plant reproduction. Thespecies is currently permitted for agricultural use only in netted greenhouses.Since 2000, imports of companion beetles have thrived, with an estimated marketsize of many billions of yen. The popularity of rare species has led to a sharprise in prices, overhunting, and smuggling from their native countries. Theseexotic species may also become invasive if they escape into nature. There are no clear restrictions on beetle imports, but a government campaign is aimed toimprove ethical standards for breeding. In addition, imported tarantulas,centipedes and scorpions are becoming increasingly popular. These species posesimilar threats as imported beetles and bees, but the actual state of importationand breeding is difficult to ascertain. Importing insects into Japan can createthe following issues: the overexploitation of rare species collected from theirnative habitats; the traffic in species of which collection and sale isprohibited; the risk that escaped individuals will breed as invasive species; andthe introduction of alien microorganisms and parasites.

AB  - The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, founded as OIE) is the recognisedintergovernmental standard-setting organisation for animal health and welfare.The WOAH mandate is to support its members in the prevention of the spread ofanimal diseases of concern, as listed in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code(Terrestrial Code). Once a disease, infection or infestation is listed, national Veterinary Authorities have the obligation regularly to notify WOAH of thepresence or absence of the listed disease. In regard to insects, the scope of theTerrestrial Code limits its recommendations to preserving the health of bees(species of the genus Apis, extended to the genus Bombus and to the stinglessbees for one disease). However, it does not include standards to mitigate thepotential animal health risks associated with the international trade of otherinsects. A description of the standard-setting process and a review of thehistory of the standards for bee health highlight the resources and requirements to expand the scope of the Terrestrial Code to include recommendations for animalhealth risk mitigation measures for the safety of international trade in insects.Any initiative to develop guidance on insect trade should include WOAH in itsrole as the sole global standard-setting organisation on animal health andwelfare matters. This aligns with the WOAH commitment to a One Health approach.

AB  - While the information on live insect shipments provided in this thematic issue ofthe Scientific and Technical Review could not be exhaustive, it clearlyrepresents a broad variety of trade, of substantial value, involving manystakeholders throughout the world. The contributions to this issue demonstratethat most of the trade in insects is carried out safely and efficiently. Theconcerns related to shipping insects described within this issue fall broadlyinto four categories: risks to human, animal and environmental health; delays andloss of quality; refusal of carriage; and high and variable costs. Someopportunities for improvements to insect shipping for diverse stakeholders areshown across these four areas of concern, with specific recommendations and ageneral call for further collaboration among stakeholders.

TI  - Zinc supplementation improves antioxidant status, and organic zinc is moreefficient than inorganic zinc in improving the bone strength of aged laying hens.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.896 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been some reports indicating that supplementation of zinc could alleviate the negative effects of age on egg quality in laying hens.However, information regarding these positive effects on health and zincdeposition in the body is limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study wasto investigate the effect of organic and inorganic sources of zinc on theantioxidant activity, bone strength, and zinc deposition in the tissues of older laying hens. METHODS: In a completely randomized design, 175 Leghorn laying hens (w36) aged 80 weeks were allocated into seven treatment groups and fivereplications: control (without zinc supplementation), zinc sulphate treatments(15, 30, and 45 mg/kg), and organic zinc treatments (15, 30, and 45 mg/kg).RESULTS: There was a significant increase in feed intake in the zinc sulphate andorganic zinc treatments compared to the control treatment (p < 0.05). The eggmass in organic and sulphate zinc showed a significant increase. The feedconversion ratio was decreased significantly in the organic zinc treatments (p < 0.05). Both organic and sulphate zinc supplements enhanced serum superoxidedismutase activity as an antioxidant index (p < 0.05). The cortical thickness of the tibia was improved in laying hens receiving 30 mg/kg organic zinc.Supplementation of zinc could lead to an increase in zinc deposition in tissues, and organic zinc boosts bone strength. CONCLUSION: Zinc supplementation canimprove antioxidant activity, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio and enhance egg mass and optimal absorption of zinc in tissues. The use of 30 mg/kg organiczinc is recommended for improving the cortical thickness of the tibia in agedlaying hens.

TI  - Wnt Signaling in Heart Development and Regeneration.
LID - 10.1007/s11886-022-01756-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deathworldwide, largely due to the limited regenerative capacity of the adult humanheart. In contrast, teleost zebrafish hearts possess natural regenerationcapacity by proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes after injury. Hearts of mice can regenerate if injured in a few days after birth, which coincides withthe transient capacity for cardiomyocyte proliferation. This review tends toelaborate the roles and mechanisms of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in heartdevelopment and regeneration in mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. RECENTFINDINGS: Studies in zebrafish, mice, and human embryonic stem cells demonstrate the binary effect for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during heart development. BothWnts and Wnt antagonists are induced in multiple cell types during cardiacdevelopment and injury repair. In this review, we summarize composites of the Wntsignaling pathway and their different action routes, followed by the discussionof their involvements in cardiac specification, proliferation, and patterning. Weprovide overviews about canonical and non-canonical Wnt activity during hearthomeostasis, remodeling, and regeneration. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling exhibitsbiphasic and antagonistic effects on cardiac specification and differentiationdepending on the stage of embryogenesis. Inhibition of Wnt signaling isbeneficial for cardiac wound healing and functional recovery after injury.Understanding of the roles and mechanisms of Wnt signaling pathway in injuredanimal hearts will contribute to the development of potential therapeutics forhuman diseased hearts.

AB  - Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), as one of the main active components of Astragalusmembranaceus, has been reported to have cardiovascular protective effects.However, the role and molecular mechanism of AS-IV in vascular senescence havenot been clearly stated. The in vitro aging model was constructed using bleomycin(BLM) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Cell senescence were assessedthrough Western blotting analysis of aging markers, flow cytometry, and thebeta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) kit. Mitophagy was determined throughtransmission electron microscopy, TMRM staining, and Western blotting analysis ofp62. A model of aging blood vessels was induced by D-gal. The vascular wallthickness of mice was also evaluated by H&E staining. Our data proved that AS-IV plays an anti-senescent role in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that AS-IVeffectively improved mitochondrial injury, raised MMP, and mediated mitophagy in BLM-induced senescent VSMCs and D-gal induced aging mice. Parkin expressionstrengthened AS-IV's anti-senescent function. In conclusions, AS-IV attenuatedBLM-induced VSMC senescence via Parkin to regulate mitophagy. Therefore,AS-IV-mediated Parkin might be a latent therapeutic agent and target for VSMCsenescence.

TI  - Linoleic and linolenic acids reduce the effects of heat stress-induced damage in pig oocytes during maturation in vitro.
LID - 10.1007/s11626-022-00708-4 [doi]
AB  - Elevated environmental temperatures can induce heat stress which could reducefertility and early embryonic development. Fatty acids can initiate an endergonicreaction that absorbs cellular heat and decreases intracellular temperature. Thisstudy's objective was to minimize heat stress-induced damage to in vitro matured oocytes by supplementing maturation media with either 50 muM linoleic orlinolenic acid or both (25 or 50 muM) during maturation at either 38.5 or 41.5degrees C. Oocytes were evaluated for intracellular antioxidative pathways,fertilization characteristics, or early embryonic development. Elevatedmaturation temperatures increased (p < 0.05) reactive oxygen species (ROS)formation and supplementation with linoleic or linolenic acid decreased (p <0.05) ROS in oocytes matured at 41.5 degrees C. Maturation temperature had aneffect (p < 0.05) on the intracellular antioxidative pathways of the oocyteexcept for glutathione peroxidase activity. Regardless of maturation temperature,supplementation with linoleic or linolenic acid increased (p < 0.05) the enzymeactivities and glutathione concentrations in the oocytes compared to no fattyacid supplementation. Supplementation of both linoleic and linolenic aciddecreased (p < 0.05) polyspermic fertilization rates. Supplementing either 25 or 50 muM linoleic and linolenic acid to maturing oocytes at 41.5 degrees Cincreased (p < 0.05) cleavage rates by 48 h after IVF and the blastocystformation rates by 144 h after IVF compared to other treatments. Oocytes matured at 38.5 degrees C had greater (p < 0.05) embryonic development than those maturedat 41.5 degrees C except for those supplemented with 50 muM linoleic andlinolenic acid. Supplementing 50 muM linoleic and linolenic acid to thematuration medium of pig oocytes reduces the effects of heat stress-induceddamage.

TI  - Carbonic anhydrase IX stratifies patient prognosis and identifies nodal status inanimal models of nasopharyngeal carcinoma using a targeted imaging strategy.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05922-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Accurate identification of nodal status enables adequate neckirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, most conventionaltechniques are unable to pick up occult metastases, leading to underestimation oftumor extensions. Here we investigate the clinical significance of carbonicanhydrase IX (CAIX) in human NPC samples, and develop a CAIX-targeted imagingstrategy to identify occult lymph node metastases (LNMs) and extranodal extension(ENE) in animal studies. METHODS: A total of 211 NPC samples are performed CAIXstaining, and clinical outcomes are analyzed. The metastatic murine models aregenerated by foot pad injection of NPC cells, and a CAIX-targeted imaging agent(CAIX-800) is intravenously administered. We adopt fluorescence moleculartomography and ultrasonography (US)-guided spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA)imaging to perform in vivo studies. Histological and immunohistochemicalcharacterization are carried out via node-by-node analysis. RESULTS: For clinicalsamples, 90.1% (91/101) primary tumors, 73.3% (66/90) metastases, and 100%(20/20) local recurrences are CAIX positive. In metastases group, 84.7% (61/72)nodal metastases and 22.2% (4/18) organ metastases are CAIX positive. CAIXexpression in primary tumors is significantly associated with NPC stage andprognosis. For animal studies, CAIX-800-based fluorescence imaging achieves 81.3%sensitivity and 93.8% specificity in detecting occult LNMs in vivo, with aminimum detectable diameter of 1.7 mm. Coupled with CAIX-800, US-guided sPAimaging could not only detect subcapsular deposits of metastatic cancer cells 2weeks earlier than conventional techniques, but also successfully trackpathological ENE. CONCLUSION: CAIX remarkably expresses in human NPCs andstratifies patient prognosis. In preclinical studies, CAIX-800-based imagingsuccessfully identifies occult LNMs and tracks early stage of pathological ENE.This attractive method shows potential in clinic, allowing medical workers tolongitudinally monitor nodal status and helping to reduce unnecessary nodalbiopsy for patients with NPC.

TI  - Isolation of Swine Bone Marrow Lin-/CD45-/CD133 + Cells and Cardio-protectiveEffects of its Exosomes.
LID - 10.1007/s12015-022-10432-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification in murine bone marrow (BM) of CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells, possessing several features of pluripotent stem cells, encouraged us toinvestigate if similar population of cells could be also isolated from the swine BM. Heart failure is the terminal stage of many cardiovascular diseases, and its key pathological basis is cardiac fibrosis (CF). Research showed that stem cellderived exosomes may play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis. The effect ofexosomes (Exos) on CF has remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: To establish an isolation and amplification method of CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells from newbron swine BM invitro, explore an highly efficient method to enrich swine bone marrow derivedCD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells and probe into their biological characteristicsfurther. Furher more, to extract exosomes from it and explore its effect on CF.METHODS: The mononuclear cells isolated from swine bone marrow by red blood cell (RBC) lysing buffer were coated by adding FcR blocking solution and coupled with CD133 antibody immunomagnetic beads, obtaining CD133 + cell group via MagneticActivated Cell Sorting (MACS). In steps, the CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells werecollected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) labeled with CD133, Linand CD45 antibodies, which were cultured and amplified in vitro. The biologicalfeatures of CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells were studied in different aspects,including morphological trait observed with inverted microscope, ultrastructural characteristics observed under transmission electron microscope, expression ofpluripotent markersidentified by immunofluorescent staining and Alkalinephosphatase staining. The Exos were extracted using a sequential centrifugationapproach and its effects on CF were analyzed in Angiotensin II (Ang-II)induced-cardiac fibrosis in vivo. Rats in each group were treated for 4 weeks,and 2D echocardiography was adopted to evaluate the heart function. The degree ofcardiac fibrosis was assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Masson's trichromestaining. RESULTS: The CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells accounted for about 0.2%-0.5% ofthe total mononuclear cells isolated from swine bone marrow. The combination ofMACS and FACS to extract CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells could improved efficiency and reduced cell apoptosis. The CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells featured typical traits of pluripotent stem cells, the nucleus is large, mainly composed of euchromatin,with less cytoplasm and larger nucleoplasmic ratio, which expressed pluripotentmarkers (SSEA-1, Oct-4, Nanog and Sox-2) and alkaline phosphatase staining waspositive.Animal experiment indicated that the cardiac injury related indexes(BNPcTnICK-MB and TNF-alpha), the expression of key gene Smad3 and the degree of cardiac fibrosis in Exo treatment group were significantly reduced compared with the control group. 4 weeks after the treatment, cardiac ejection fraction (EF)value in the model group showed a remarkable decrease, indicating the inductionof HF model. While Exo elevated the EF values, demonstrating cardio-protectiveeffects. CONCLUSION: The CD133 + /Lin-/CD45- cells derived from swine bone marrowwere successfully isolated and amplified, laying a good foundation for furtherresearch on this promising therapeutic cell. The Exos may be a promisingpotential treatment strategy for CF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The demands on conjunctival replacement tissues are high: they needto be elastic, clinically compatible, surgically feasible and support goblet cellgrowth. OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview of currently appliedconjunctival replacement tissues and those under investigation. METHOD: Currentpublications on clinically applied conjunctival replacement tissues andsubstrates which are the subject of scientific research and those already tested in animal models are presented and discussed. RESULTS: Replacement tissues inclinical use are autologous and allogenic conjunctiva, nasal and oral mucousmembranes, amniotic membrane and decellularized tissues. Autologous conjunctivashows good results but is not suitable for large defects due to limitedavailability. In these cases autologous nasal and oral mucous membranes can beused; however, success is limited in cases of autoimmune diseases. Amnioticmembranes are frequently applied clinically but goblet cell growth is limited.Different decellularized tissues are used clinically and goblet cell growth wasfound in vivo. Robust comparative studies are not yet available. Biologicalmatrices such as fibrin, collagen, elastin, gelatin or hyaluronate and synthetic tissues from the group of polyesters are being investigated in the laboratory andin animal models. These studies show good epithelialization and goblet cellgrowth in vivo. CONCLUSION: Transplantation of conjunctiva, nasal and oral mucousmembranes and amniotic membranes show satisfactory clinical results but exhibitindividual weaknesses. Further studies in animal models and clinical settings arerequired to further evaluate the benefits of other matrices, such as cell-freetissues or other biological and synthetic matrices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic particle imaging offers far-reaching potential with a uniquerange of applications. OBJECTIVES: Identification of application scenarios withadded value for clinical use. METHODS: Overview of previous application scenariosin phantom and small animal models, evaluation of dual-use potential. RESULTS:With its unique application profile, magnetic particle imaging offers a solution for clinical use where common, established imaging techniques reach their limits.As a tracer imaging technique, it is particularly characterized by its highspeed, sensitivity and contrast-to-noise ratio. The low magnetic fields and lowpower consumption allow imaging to be mobile and taken to locations that werepreviously inaccessible. CONCLUSION: Magnetic particle imaging has seen rapiddevelopment in recent years. The applications demonstrated in the small animalmodel and phantom were able to support the versatility and added value of themethod. With the availability of human imaging systems, the technology must face clinical verification studies.

TI  - Yearling bulls have reduced sperm concentration and increased seminal plasmainterleukin-8 after a 28-day breeding season.
LID - 10.1111/rda.14223 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that yearling bulls selected for a 28-d breeding season wouldhave reduced sperm concentrations, morphology, and have increased seminal plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Yearling bulls were selected based on a breeding soundness examination at approximately 415-d ofage and contained at least 750 million sperm in the ejaculate, with 12 bullsrandomly selected for breeding (BREEDERS) and 12 bulls not selected for breeding (NON-BREEDERS). After a 28-d breeding period, all bulls underwent a breedingsoundness exam. Plasma and seminal plasma were collected at each time point foranalysis. Data were analyzed utilizing either the MIXED or GLIMMIX procedureswith repeated measures in SAS with breeding group, age, and the interaction asfixed effects. Sperm concentration per ml of ejaculate was reduced (P<0.05) inyearling bulls used for breeding compared with those not used for breeding at theend of the breeding season. Seminal plasma IL-8 concentrations in yearling bulls used for breeding were increased (P<0.05) after the breeding season compared tobulls not used for breeding. Taken together, yearling bulls selected for a 28-dbreeding season have reduced sperm production per ml of an ejaculate andincreased inflammatory response in the seminal plasma that can lead to impairedbreeding response if they are to be used for more than 30-d of breeding.

TI  - Treatments for Social Interaction Impairment in Animal Models of Schizophrenia: ACritical Review and Meta-analysis.
LID - sbac093 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbac093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While pharmacological treatments for positive symptoms ofschizophrenia are widely used, their beneficial effect on negative symptoms,particularly social impairment, is insufficiently studied. Therefore, there is anincreasing interest in preclinical research of potentially beneficial treatments,with mixed results. The current review aims to evaluate the efficacy of availabletreatments for social deficits in different animal models of schizophrenia. STUDYDESIGN: A systematic literature search generated 145 outcomes for the measures"total time" and "number" of social interactions. Standardized mean differences(SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, and heterogeneity wastested using Q statistics in a random-effect meta-analytic model. Given the vast heterogeneity in effect sizes, the animal model, treatment group, and sample sizewere all examined as potential moderators. STUDY RESULTS: The results showed thatin almost all models, treatment significantly improved social deficit (totaltime: SMD = 1.24; number: SMD = 1.1). The moderator analyses discoveredsignificant subgroup differences across models and treatment subgroups. Perinataland adult pharmacological models showed the most substantial influence oftreatments on social deficits, reflecting relative pharmacological validity.Furthermore, atypical antipsychotic drugs had the highest SMD within each modelsubgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the improvement in socialinteraction behaviors is dependent on the animal model and treatment family used.Implications for the preclinical and clinical fields are discussed.

AB  - Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an aging-associated condition characterized by theclonal outgrowth of mutated pre-leukemic cells. Individuals with CH are at anincreased risk of developing hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we describe anovel animal model carrying a recurrent TET2 missense mutation, frequently found in CH and leukemic patients. In a fashion similar to CH, animals show signs ofdisease late in life when they develop a wide range of myeloid neoplasms,including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using single cell transcriptomicprofiling of the bone marrow, we show that disease progression in aged animalscorrelates with an enhanced inflammatory response and the emergence of anaberrant inflammatory monocytic cell population. The gene signaturecharacteristic of this inflammatory population is associated to poor prognosis inAML patients. Our study illustrates an example of collaboration between a geneticlesion found in CH and inflammation, leading to transformation and theestablishment of blood neoplasms.

TI  - Efficacy of the Antimalarial MMV390048 against Babesia Infection RevealsPhosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase as a Druggable Target for Babesiosis.
PG  - e0057422
LID - 10.1128/aac.00574-22 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-Babesia effect of MMV390048, a drug that inhibits Plasmodium by targeting the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K).The half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MMV390048 against the in vitro growthof Babesia gibsoni was 6.9 +/- 0.9 muM. In immunocompetent mice, oral treatmentwith MMV390048 at a concentration of 20 mg/kg effectively inhibited the growth ofB. microti (Peabody mjr strain). The peak parasitemia in the control group was30.5%, whereas the peak parasitemia in the MMV390048-treated group was 3.4%.Meanwhile, MMV390048 also showed inhibition on the growth of B. rodhaini(Australia strain), a highly pathogenic rodent Babesia species. AllMMV390048-treated mice survived, whereas the mice in control group died within 10days postinfection (DPI). The first 7-day administration of MMV390048 in B.microti-infected, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice delayed the riseof parasitemia by 26 days. Subsequently, a second 7-day administration was given upon recurrence. At 52 DPI, a parasite relapse (in 1 out of 5 mice) and amutation in the B. microti PI4K L746S, a MMV390048 resistance-related gene, were detected. Although the radical cure of B. microti infection in immunocompromised host SCID mice was not achieved, results from this study showed that MMV390048has excellent inhibitory effects on Babesia parasites, revealing a new treatment strategy for babesiosis: targeting the B. microti PI4K.

AB  - The rumen, which contains a series of prokaryotes and eukaryotes with highabundance, determines the high ability to degrade complex carbohydrates inruminants. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we compared the ruminal microbiota of dairy goats with that in the foregut and colon of mice and found more Bacteroidesidentified in the rumen, which helps ruminants to utilize plant-derivedpolysaccharides, cellulose, and other structural carbohydrates. Furthermore,high-fiber diets did not significantly increase intestinal fiber-degradingbacteria in mice, but did produce higher levels of ruminal fiber-degradingbacteria in dairy goats. Through rumen microbe transplantation (RMT), we foundthat rumen-derived fiber-degrading bacteria can colonize the intestines of miceto exert their fiber-degrading function, but their colonization efficiency isaffected by diet. Additionally, the colonization of these fiber-degradingbacteria in the colon may involve higher content of butyrate in the colon,protecting the colonic epithelial barrier and promoting energy metabolism.Overall, the fiber degradation function of rumen bacteria through RMT wasverified, and our results provide new insights into isolating the functional and beneficial fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen, providing a theoretical basisfor the role of dietary fiber in intestinal health. IMPORTANCE Ruminants have apowerful progastric digestive system that converts structural carbohydrates into nutrients useful to humans. It is well known that this phenomenon is due to thefact that the rumen of ruminants is a natural microbial fermenter, which canferment structural carbohydrates such as cellulose and hemicellulose andtransform them into volatile fatty acids to supply energy for host. However,monogastric animals have an inherent disadvantage in utilizing fiber, soscreening rumen-derived fiber-degrading bacteria as a fermentation strain forbiological feed is needed in an attempt at improving the fiber digestibility ofmonogastric animals. In this study, a ruminal microbiota transplant experimentfrom goats to mice proves that ruminal microbiota could serve as a key factor in utilization of high-fiber diets and provides a new perspective for thedevelopment of probiotics with fiber degradation function from the rumen and the importance of the use of prebiotics during the intake of probiotics.

TI  - Pandemic 1918 Influenza Virus Does Not Cause Lethal Infection in Rhesus orCynomolgus Macaques.
PG  - e0072822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00728-22 [doi]
AB  - The 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic was among the most severe in history, taking thelives of approximately 50 million people worldwide, and novel prophylacticvaccines are urgently needed to prevent another pandemic. Given that macaques arephysiologically relevant preclinical models of human immunology that haveadvanced the clinical treatment of infectious diseases, a lethal pandemicinfluenza challenge model would provide a stringent platform for testing newinfluenza vaccine concepts. To this end, we infected rhesus macaques andMauritian cynomolgus macaques with highly pathogenic 1918 H1N1 influenza virusand assessed pathogenesis and disease severity. Despite infection with a highdose of 1918 influenza delivered via multiple routes, rhesus macaquesdemonstrated minimal signs of disease, with only intermittent viral shedding.Cynomolgus macaques infected via intrabronchial instillation demonstrated mildsymptoms, with disease severity depending on the infection dose. Cynomolgusmacaques infected with a high dose of 1918 influenza delivered via multipleroutes experienced moderate disease characterized by consistent viral shedding,pulmonary infiltrates, and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. However, 1918influenza was uniformly nonlethal in these two species, demonstrating that thisisolate is insufficiently pathogenic in rhesus and Mauritian cynomolgus macaques to support testing novel prophylactic influenza approaches where protection from severe disease combined with a lethal outcome is desired as a highly stringentindication of vaccine efficacy. IMPORTANCE The world remains at risk of aninfluenza pandemic, and the development of new therapeutic and preventativemodalities is critically important for minimizing human death and sufferingduring the next influenza pandemic. Animal models are central to the development of new therapies and vaccine approaches. In particular, nonhuman primates likerhesus and cynomolgus macaques are highly relevant preclinical models given theirphysiological and immunological similarities to humans. Unfortunately, thereremains a scarcity of macaque models of pandemic influenza with which to testnovel antiviral modalities. Here, we demonstrate that even at the highest dosestested, 1918 influenza was not lethal in these two macaque species, suggestingthat they are not ideal for the development and testing of novel pandemicinfluenza-specific vaccines and therapies. Therefore, other physiologicallyrelevant nonhuman primate models of pandemic influenza are needed.

TI  - Metabolism in the Niche: a Large-Scale Genome-Based Survey Reveals InositolUtilization To Be Widespread among Soil, Commensal, and Pathogenic Bacteria.

AB  - Phytate is the main phosphorus storage molecule of plants and is thereforepresent in large amounts in the environment and in the diet of humans andanimals. Its dephosphorylated form, the polyol myo-inositol (MI), can be used by bacteria as a sole carbon and energy source. The biochemistry and regulation ofMI degradation were deciphered in Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica, but a systematic survey of this catabolic pathway has been missing until now. For acomprehensive overview of the distribution of MI utilization, we analyzed 193,757bacterial genomes, representing a total of 24,812 species, for the presence,organization, and taxonomic prevalence of inositol catabolic gene clusters(IolCatGCs). The genetic capacity for MI degradation was detected in 7,384(29.8%) of all species for which genome sequences were available.IolCatGC-positive species were particularly found among Actinobacteria andProteobacteria and to a much lesser extent in Bacteroidetes. IolCatGCs are verydiverse in terms of gene number and functions, whereas the order of core genes ishighly conserved on the phylum level. We predict that 111 animal pathogens, more than 200 commensals, and 430 plant pathogens or rhizosphere bacteria utilize MI, underscoring that IolCatGCs provide a growth benefit within distinct ecologicalniches. IMPORTANCE This study reveals that the capacity to utilize inositol isunexpectedly widespread among soil, commensal, and pathogenic bacteria. We assumethat this yet-neglected metabolism plays a pivotal role in the microbial turnoverof phytate and inositols. The bioinformatic tool established here enablespredicting to which extent and genetic variance a bacterial determinant ispresent in all genomes sequenced so far.

TI  - Characterization of a Novel RNA Virus Causing Massive Mortality in YellowCatfish, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, as an Emerging Genus in Caliciviridae(Picornavirales).
PG  - e0062422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00624-22 [doi]
AB  - An emerging disease in farmed yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) causingmassive mortality broke out in 2020 in Hubei, China. Histopathologicalexamination indicated significant changes in kidneys and spleens of diseasedfish. Electron microscopy revealed large numbers of viral particles in thekidneys and spleens. These particles were spherical with a diameter ofapproximately 35 nm. By using RNA sequencing and rapid identification of cDNAends, the full nucleotide sequence of the virus was identified. The viral genome comprises 7,432 bp and contains three open reading frames sharing no nucleotidesequence similarity with other viruses; however, the amino acid sequencepartially matched that of the nonstructural (NS) proteins from viruses in theorder Picornavirales. Combined with the phylogenetic analysis, the conservedamino acid motifs and the domains of the viral genome predict a genome ordertypical of a calicivirus. Therefore, this virus was tentatively named yellowcatfish calicivirus (YcCV). Cell culture showed that YcCV could cause acytopathic effect in the channel catfish kidney cell line (CCK) at earlypassages. In artificial infection, this virus could infect healthy yellow catfishand led to clinical symptoms similar to those that occurred naturally. In situhybridization analysis detected positive signals of the virus in kidney, spleen, liver, heart, and gill tissues of diseased fish. This study represents the first report of calicivirus infection in yellow catfish and provides a solid basis for future studies on the control of this viral disease. IMPORTANCE Caliciviruses arerapidly evolving viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks associated withsignificant morbidity and mortality globally. A novel calicivirus identified fromyellow catfish also causes substantial mortality. Using an RNA sequencing(RNA-seq) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method, the full nucleotidesequence was identified and characterized, and this virus was tentatively namedyellow catfish calicivirus (YcCV). A nucleotide sequence similarity search found no match with other viruses, and an amino acid sequence comparison indicatedapproximately 23.3% amino acid homology with the viruses in the orderPicornavirales. These findings may represent a new avenue to explain virusevolution and suggest a need to further study the pathogenesis of calicivirus andcharacterize possible interactions among interspecific viruses in the aquacultureenvironment.

AB  - Two monoclonal in vitro isolates of Perkinsus beihaiensis were established fromtissues of infected Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, using alipid concentrate and yeast extract medium (LpcYM) to induce enlargedprezoospoangia from histozoic trophozoites, and Perkinsus broth medium (PBM) tosupport subsequent zoosporulation and schizogonic proliferation from those cells.Zoospores of the isolates developed into uninucleate signet-ring trophozoitesfollowed by schizonts typical of Perkinsus spp., but an additional type ofunknown botryoidal cell clusters appeared and increased in density. Thesebotryoidal cell clusters had second-generation daughter schizonts within whichfurther internal cells were produced. Although botryoidal cell clusters inprimary cultures rarely proliferated in PBM, cells contained by botryoidalclusters enlarged as prezoosporangia in LpcYM, and a large number ofproliferative stages (i.e. trophozoites and schizonts typical for Perkinsus spp.)were obtained from these prezoosporangia in PBM. At lower cell density,trophozoites transformed into the botryoidal cell clusters in PBM, and the numberof cells increased little, while trophozoites rapidly increased by typicalschizogony at higher density in PBM. Based on these observations, we determinedan optimal cell density for continuous culture of P. beihaiensis isolates,confirmed their ability to proliferate and survive after cryopreservation, anddescribe an experimental protocol to culture this most recently described speciesin the genus Perkinsus.

AB  - The release of ornamental pets outside their native range can directly orindirectly impact the recipient community, e.g. via the co-introduction ofassociated pathogens. However, studies on parasites associated with non-nativespecies, in particular freshwater decapods, have focused mainly on a limited set of pathogens. Here we provide data for the first time on microsporidian parasitesof the non-native ornamental shrimp Neocaridina davidi, collected in a stream in Germany. Furthermore, we confirm an ongoing range expansion of the warm-adaptedN. davidi from thermally polluted colder water. In the investigated shrimps, the microsporidian parasite Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei and an unknown microsporidianisolate were detected, raising concerns about their transmission potential andpathogenicity on native crustacean species.

AB  - Postischemic neuroinflammation is a critical pathophysiological process withinthe entire scheme of cerebral ischemia, covering early damage and the period oftissue repair. It is characterized by microglial and astroglial activation withincreased expression of inflammatory mediators and is accompanied by impairedinnate and adaptive immune responses. In acute ischemic stroke (IS),neuroinflammation is caused by the response of resident immune cells of microgliaand peripheral immunocompetent cells infiltrating the brain tissue, whichpenetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the lesion. Recent studies haveshown the important role of the NLRP3-mediated inflammation in the death ofneurons and glial cells in acute IS. The review presents the main mechanisms ofactivation of NLRP3-mediated inflammation in acute IS, leading to the caspase-1formation and the IL-1beta and IL-18 release, which are involved in theinitiation and progression of inflammation in the brain parenchyma. Theliterature data on the role of autophagy in the inhibition of postischemicneuroinflammation are summarized. Autophagy can suppress neuroinflammationthrough a wide range of the autophagy - related proteins. The role of autophagyas a negative regulator of NLRP3-mediated inflammation in acute IS is analyzed.Data on the participation of autophagic proteins Beclin-1, LC3, and p62 in thesuppression of NLRP3 inflammation due to the induction of basic mitophagy arepresented. Prospects for modulating autophagy aimed at suppressing postischemicneuroinflammation, including the inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasome, have beennoted. The review was based on sources from international and national databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Springer, RINC.

TI  - Ivermectin induces chicken BCRP/ABCG2 expression and function: Involvement of CXRsignaling pathway and mRNA stabilization.
LID - 10.1111/jvp.13090 [doi]
AB  - Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone antiparasitic drug widely used in human andveterinary medicine. Previous studies indicated that ivermectin could interactwith P-glycoprotein, being a good inducer and substrate; however, it is unknownwhether ivermectin affects BCRP of chicken. In this study, we found thativermectin distinctly affected the expression of BCRP in a time- andconcentration-dependent up-regulatory way in chicken primary hepatocytes.Subsequent series of experiments showed that the BCRP induction is related withthe increase of CXR expression and, promoting CXR translocations to the nucleusand enhancing the stability of Abcg2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level byivermectin. Furthermore, we observed that ivermectin also enhanced the stability of Abcg2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level by Act-D chase assay. We got the similar results by in vivo test that ivermectin-induced BCRP and CXR expressionin pharmacologically important tissues, and decreased the apparent permeabilitycoefficient of florfenicol (substrate of chicken BCRP). In conclusion, theresults indicated that ivermectin could induce chicken BCRP expression andfunction through the transcriptional CXR signaling pathway andpost-transcriptional mRNA stabilization.

TI  - Global disease burden of stroke attributable to high fasting plasma glucose in204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019: An analysis of the Global Burdenof Disease Study.
LID - 10.1111/1753-0407.13299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) is the leading risk factorcontributing to the increase of stroke burden in the past three decades. However,the global distribution of stroke burden specifically attributable to HFPG wasnot studied in depth. Therefore, we analyzed the HFPG-attributable burden instroke and its subtypes in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.METHODS: Detailed data on stroke burden attributable to HFPG were obtained fromthe Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The numbers and age-standardized ratesof stroke disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), deaths, years lived withdisability, and years of life lost between 1990 and 2019 were estimated by age,sex, and region. RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized rate of DALYs (ASDR) ofHFPG-attributable stroke was 354.95 per 100 000 population, among which 49.0% wasfrom ischemic stroke, 44.3% from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 6.6% fromsubarachnoid hemorrhage. The ASDRs of HFPG-attributable stroke in lowersociodemographic index (SDI) regions surpassed those in higher SDI regions in thepast three decades. Generally, the population aged over 50 years old accountedfor 92% of stroke DALYs attributable to HFPG, and males are more susceptible toHFPG-attributable stroke than females across their lifetime. CONCLUSIONS:Successful key population initiatives targeting HFPG may mitigate the strokedisease burden. Given the soaring population-attributable fractions of HFPG forstroke burden worldwide, each country should assess its disease burden anddetermine targeted prevention and control strategies.

AB  - Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) are promising candidates forcardiac repair/regeneration. The application of copolymer nanoscaffolds hasreceived great attention in tissue engineering to support differentiation andfunctional tissue organization toward effective tissue regeneration. Theobjective of the current study was to develop functional and bioactive scaffolds by combining polycaprolactone (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLA) for cardiomyocytedifferentiation of human Ad-MSC (hAd-MSCs) in the absence or presence of5-azacytidine and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). To that end, thehuman MSCs were extracted from human adipose tissue (AD). The cardiomyocytedifferentiation potency of hAd-MSCs was evaluated on the novel synthetic PCL/PLA nanofiber scaffolds prepared in the absence and presence of 5-azacytidine andTGF-beta supplements. A PCL/PLA nanofibrous scaffold was fabricated using theelectrospinning method and its nanotopography and porous structure werecharacterized using scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the attachment of hAd-MSCs on the PCL/PLA scaffolds was semiquantitatively investigated. Comparedwith other treatments, the PCL/PLA nanofibrous scaffold supplemented with both5-azacytidine and TGF-beta was observed to differentiate hAd-MSCs intocardiomyocytes at Day 21 as evidenced by real-time PCR for cardiac-specific genesincluding cardiac troponin I (cTnI), GATA4, MYH7, and NKX2.5. In addition, flowcytometric analysis of cTnI-positive cells demonstrated that the cardiomyocytedifferentiation of hAd-MSCs was more efficient on the PCL/PLA nanofibrousscaffold supplemented with both 5-azacytidine and TGF-beta than it was in theother treatment groups. Generally speaking, the results show that PCL/PLAnanofibrous scaffolds may be applied as a platform for efficient differentiation of hAd-MSCs into functional cardiomyocytes.

TI  - Incisional negative pressure wound therapy to reduce surgical-site infections in major limb amputations: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 526-532
LID - 10.1530/EOR-22-0049 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) has showneffectiveness in the treatment of high-risk surgical wounds. Especially patients with diabetes-induced peripheral arterial disease undergoing major limbamputation have a high intrinsic risk for post-surgical wound infections. Whilenormal gauze wound dressings do not cause stimulation of microvasculature, iNPWT might improve wound healing and reduce wound complications. The purpose of thisstudy was to systematically review the literature for rates of woundcomplications and readmissions, as well as post-surgical 30-day mortality.Methods: We conducted a systematic review searching the Cochrane, PubMed, andOvid databases. Inclusion criteria were the modified Coleman methodology Score>60, non-traumatic major limb amputation, and adult patients. Traumaticamputations and animal studies were excluded. Relevant articles were reviewedindependently by referring to the title and abstract. In a meta-analysis, wecompared 3 studies and 457 patients. Results: A significantly overall lower rate of postoperative complications is associated with usage of iNPWT (odds ratio (OR)= 0.52; 95% CI: 0.30-0.89; P = 0.02). There was no significant improvement for30-day mortality, when iNPWT was used (OR= 081; 95% CI: 0.46 - 1.45; P = 0.48).Nevertheless, we did not note a significant difference in the readmission rate orrevision surgery between the two groups. Conclusion: Overall, the usage of iNPWT may reduce the risk of postoperative wound complications in major lower limbamputations but does not improve 30-day mortality rates significantly. However,to anticipate surgical-site infection, iNPWT has shown effectiveness and thusshould be used whenever applicable.

LID - 10.4102/ojvr.v89i1.2021 [doi]
AB  - Detailed information on specific species of non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) hasbecome a necessity for effective udder health control programs in South Africa.The main objective of this preliminary study was to identify the different NASspecies and strains present in dairy herds in South Africa using a cost-effectivemethod. A further objective was to investigate the effects of cow risk factorsand farming systems on the NAS isolates identified. A total of 214 NAS, isolated from milk collected from 17 South African dairy herds, were identified usingthree diagnostic tests (API Staph test, MALDI-TOF and 16s rRNA). There was a goodobserved agreement between the MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA sequencing (92.2%) and apoor observed agreement between the MALDI-TOF and API Staph (25.7%). The genetic relatedness within species was investigated in 128 of these isolates using randompolymorphic amplified deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (RAPD), verified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and phylogenetic analysis and cow risk factors wereinvestigated on species level. The main NAS species isolated were Staphylococcus chromogenes (75.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.4%) and Staphylococcushaemolyticus (8.9%). The RAPD test identified 34 Staphylococcus chromogenes, 13Staphylococcus epidermidis and nine Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains,indicating genetic diversity amongst strains and herds. The presence of NASintramammary infections was found to be significantly related to the farmingsystems, composite cow milk somatic cell count (SCC), parity and days in milk(DIM). Significantly more NAS were isolated from primiparous and from older cows.This knowledge could assist with the management of NAS on dairy farms.

AB  - Gastropod-associated nematodes have been previously studied and documentedworldwide, with some species forming host-specific association as obligateparasites of molluscs while others form intermediate and temporary association.Philippinella moellendorffi from Imelda, Zamboanga Sibugay, Philippines, werecollected, washed and maintained in the laboratory until death. Cadavers wereplaced on nutrient agar to allow nematode proliferation. Nematode pure culturewas obtained using one gravid female for propagation. Morphology and molecularanalyses (18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rDNA) wereemployed as diagnostic tools in identifying the nematode species isolated from P.moellendorffi. The newly isolated nematode was identified as Caenorhabditisbrenneri, thus designated as C. brenneri strain IZSP from the Philippines. Thisis the first record of C. brenneri isolated from the terrestrial slug P.moellendorffi.

AB  - Elizabethkingia bacteria are globally emerging pathogens that cause opportunisticand nosocomial infections, with up to 40% mortality among the immunocompromised. Elizabethkingia species are in the pipeline of organisms for high-throughputstructural analysis at the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for InfectiousDisease (SSGCID). These efforts include the structure-function analysis ofpotential therapeutic targets. Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) is essential for tRNA aminoacylation and is under investigation as a bacterial drug target. TheSSGCID produced, crystallized and determined high-resolution structures of GluRS from E. meningosepticum (EmGluRS) and E. anopheles (EaGluRS). EmGluRS wasco-crystallized with glutamate, while EaGluRS is an apo structure. EmGluRS sharesapproximately 97% sequence identity with EaGluRS but less than 39% sequenceidentity with any other structure in the Protein Data Bank. EmGluRS and EaGluRShave the prototypical bacterial GluRS topology. EmGluRS and EaGluRS have similar binding sites and tertiary structures to other bacterial GluRSs that arepromising drug targets. These structural similarities can be exploited for drugdiscovery.

PG  - 640-645
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20220309-00232 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of tanshinone II A on myocardial remodeling inischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced heart failure of rodent model. METHODS: (1) Invivo, 30 SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation, heart failure andtanshinone II A treatment group, with 10 rats in each group. The I/R model wasestablished by ligating the left coronary artery until ST segment elevation for30 minutes, then the ligation was removed for 2 hours as reperfusion. In the shamoperation group, the rat chest was opened without artery ligation. Three daysafter model establishment, tanshinone II A (10 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneal injected in tanshinone II A group for 9 weeks. In the other two groups, normalsaline was administrated in the same way. The behavioral manifestations of therats in each group were observed; hemodynamic indexes were evaluated; Massonstaining was performed to observe the degree of myocardial fibrosis; enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the content of Galectin-3in myocardial tissue; quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expressions of collagen III, collagenI, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase(TIMP-1). (2) In vitro, rats primary cardiac fibroblasts were extracted andisolated, and divided into blank control group, angiotensin II group (7-10 mmol/Langiotensin II) and angiotensin II + tanshinone II A group (7-10 mmol/Langiotensin II + 5-10 mmol/L tanshinone II A). At 24 hours and 48 hours ofculture, the cell proliferation in each group was detected by methyl thiazolyltetrazolium (MTT); the expressions of collagen III, collagen I, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 were detected by qRT-PCR; the content of Galectin-3 in cardiac fibroblasts wasdetected by ELSIA. RESULTS: (1) In vivo, the rats' activity status, hairconformity and food intake were ranked from good to bad in order of shamoperation group, tanshinone II A group and heart failure model group. Comparedwith the sham-operated group, the heart rate (HR) of the rats in the heartfailure model group was significantly decreased and the heart function wassignificantly impaired. The mRNA and protein expression of collagen I, collagenIII, TIMP-1 and Galectin-3 content were significantly increased, while the mRNAand protein expression of MMP-2 were significantly decreased. Compared with theheart failure model group, rats in the tanshinone II A group showed significantlyhigher HR and improved cardiac function, significantly lower mRNA expression ofcollagen I and collagen III, significantly lower mRNA and protein expression ofTIMP-1 and Galectin-3, and significantly higher mRNA and protein expression ofMMP-2, and the most obvious changes were in the 9th weeks of modeling [collagen ImRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 4.70+/-1.19 vs. 10.21+/-1.62, collagen III mRNA(2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 3.03+/-0.46 vs. 13.84+/-1.93, TIMP-1 mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)):1.90+/-0.19 vs. 4.55+/-0.43, TIMP-1/GAPDH: 0.33+/-0.04 vs. 0.67+/-0.05,Galectin-3 (ng/L): 489.93+/-79.30 vs. 821.72+/-94.09, MMP-2 mRNA(2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 0.37+/-0.07 vs. 0.03+/-0.01, MMP-2/GAPDH: 0.69+/-0.09 vs.0.21+/-0.04, all P < 0.05]. Masson staining showed that myocardial tissuefibrosis was obvious in the heart failure group, and the degree of fibrosis inthe tanshinone II A group was reduced. (2) In vitro, compared with the blankcontrol group, the proliferation rate, collagen I, collagen III and TIMP-1expression and Galectin-3 content of myocardial fibroblasts were significantlyincreased, and MMP-2 expression was significantly decreased in the angiotensingroup at 24 h and 48 h of culture. Compared with the angiotensin group, theproliferation rate of cardiac fibroblasts and the expression of collagen I,collagen III and TIMP-1 and the content of Galectin-3 were significantlydecreased, and the expression of MMP-2 mRNA was significantly increased in theangiotensin + tanshinone II A group, and the most significant changes were at 48 hours of culture [proliferation rate: (57.0+/-3.7)% vs. (67.0+/-2.4)%, collagen ImRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 551.43+/-67.10 vs. 871.48+/-12.25, collagen III mRNA(2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 233.76+/-18.73 vs. 385.51+/-31.35, TIMP-1 mRNA(2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 238.69+/-17.37 vs. 351.84+/-26.17, Galectin-3 (ng/L):283.76+/-28.73 vs. 415.51+/-31.35, MMP-2 mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 108.54+/-12.10 vs. 51.47+/-6.25, all P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Tanshinone II A can improve cardiacfunction, inhibit myocardial fibrosis and improve myocardial remodeling in ratswith I/R-induced heart failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether signal transducer and activator oftranscription (STAT1/3/5) have a protective effect on hyperoxia-induced acutelung injury (HALI) and its mechanism. METHODS: Seventy C57BL/6J mice wererandomly divided into five groups: normoxia control group, HALI group, andSTAT1/3/5 inhibitor groups, with 14 mice in each group. The HALI model wasestablished by exposure to more than 90% hyperoxia for 48 hours; three STATinhibitor groups were pretreated by intraperitoneal injection of STAT1 inhibitor 40 mg/kg and STAT3 inhibitor 5 mg/kg, and STAT5 inhibitor 10 mg/kg for 1 week.Six blood samples were randomly collected from each group, and microRNA-21(miR-21) expression was measured by quantitative real-time reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Lung tissue of the sacrificedmice was obtained, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used todetect the contents of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins(IL-6, IL-1beta), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), andmatrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). The water content of lung tissue wascalculated. The pathological changes in lung tissue were observed under the lightmicroscope, and the pathological score of lung injury was performed. Westernblotting was used to detect the expression of phosphorylated STAT (p-STAT1,p-STAT3, p-STAT5) in lung tissue. The 7-day cumulative survival rates of theremaining 8 mice in each group were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: Under the light microscope, the alveolar structures in the HALI groupand the STAT1 inhibitor group were destroyed, a large number of neutrophils (NEU)infiltrated in the alveoli and lung interstitium, which were thickened. Thepathological score of lung injury and the water content of the lung tissue wassignificantly increased. In STAT3 inhibitor and STAT5 inhibitor groups, thealveolar cavity was clear, the degree of NEU infiltration and the thickness oflung interstitium were lower than those in HALI group, the pathological score of lung injury and the water content of lung tissue were significantly decreased,especially in STAT3 inhibitor group. Compared with the normoxia control group,the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, MDA, and MMP9, and the expressionlevels of p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 in the HALI group were significantly increased. In contrast, the content of SOD and the expression of miR-21 were significantlydecreased. Compared with the HALI group, the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6,IL-1beta, MDA, and MMP9 in the STAT3 inhibitor group and STAT5 inhibitor groupwere significantly decreased. At the same time, the content of SOD and theexpression of miR-21 were significantly increased, especially in STAT3 inhibitor group [TNF-alpha (mug/L): 42.53+/-3.25 vs. 86.36+/-5.48, IL-6 (ng/L):68.46+/-4.28 vs. 145.00+/-6.89, IL-1beta (mug/L): 28.74+/-3.53 vs. 68.00+/-5.64, MDA (mumol/g): 20.33+/-2.74 vs. 42.58+/-3.45, and MMP9 (ng/L): 128.55+/-6.35 vs. 325.13+/-6.65, SOD (kU/g): 50.53+/-4.19 vs. 22.53+/-3.27, miR-21(2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 0.550+/-0.018 vs. 0.316+/-0.037, all P < 0.05]. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that the 7-day cumulative survival rates of theSTAT3 inhibitor group and STAT5 inhibitor group were significantly higher thanthose of the HALI group [62.5% (5/8), 37.5% (3/8) vs. 12.5% (1/8), both P <0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of STAT3 hyperactivation may suppress theinflammatory response, regulate oxidative stress, improve lung permeabilitythrough regulating the expression of miR-21, which exert lung protection in HALI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effect of Xiaoqinglong decoction on vascular endothelin(ET) in rats pulmonary hypertension (PAH) model based on the Jiebiaokuoluomethod. METHODS: Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into six groups:control group, PAH model group, positive drug group, and Xiaoqinglong decoctionin the high-dose, medium-dose and low-dose groups, 10 rats in each group. Thecontrol group did not receive any treatment. The remaining groups were kept inlow-pressure oxygen tanks, injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 200 muL onday 1 and day 14, respectively. The rats were smoked twice a day from day 2 today 30 (except day 14) at 4 hours intervals. The rats were placed in alow-temperature environment for 1 hour per day, and were put into cold water toswim (for 2 weeks), while the rats were given a cold diet. After modeling, thecontrol group and the PAH model group were given equal volumes of normal saline; the positive drug group was given bosentan (100 mg/kg); Xiaoqinglong decoction15, 10 and 5 g/kg was given, respectively, in the high, medium and low dosegroups; once daily for 30 days. The mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) andright ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) were then measured with right heartcatheterization and the right ventricle hypertrophy index (RVHI) was assessed;ET-1 and nitric oxide (NO) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS:Compared with the control group, the levels of mPAP, RVSP, RVHI and ET-1 weresignificantly increased in the PAH model group [mPAP (mmHg, 1 mmHg approximately 0.133 kPa): 33.20+/-1.04 vs. 13.20+/-1.03, RVSP (mmHg): 62.40+/-1.54 vs.24.20+/-1.02, RVHI: 42.90+/-2.51 vs. 25.40+/-2.01, ET-1 (ng/L): 100.80+/-20.34vs. 81.50+/-13.84, all P < 0.05], while NO levels were significantly decreased(mmol/L: 23.20+/-1.81 vs. 31.70+/-1.49, P < 0.05). Compared with the PAH modelgroup, the levels of mPAP, RVSP, RVHI and ET-1 in the positive drug group andhigh, medium, low dose groups of Xiaoqinglong decoction were significantlydecreased [mPAP (mmHg): 25.50+/-0.84, 26.90+/-0.74, 27.10+/-1.19, 29.10+/-0.75vs. 33.20+/-1.04, RVSP (mmHg): 54.40+/-5.14, 50.10+/-1.67, 53.10+/-1.05,56.60+/-1.07 vs. 62.40+/-1.54, RVHI: 41.10+/-1.19, 31.20+/-1.67, 31.30+/-1.89,40.30+/-1.88 vs. 42.90+/-2.51, ET-1 (ng/L): 70.70+/-7.89, 69.90+/-2.92,71.70+/-4.32, 73.90+/-5.19 vs. 100.80+/-20.34, all P < 0.05], while NO levelswere significantly increased (mmol/L: 32.50+/-2.06, 34.70+/-1.16, 32.70+/-1.33,30.10+/-1.19 vs. 23.20+/-1.81, all P < 0.05), and with the increased dose ofXiaoqinglong decoction, the change was more obvious, and the effect was better inthe high-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Xiaoqinglong decoction can reduce rats PAH byregulating ET-1 and NO levels in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  - [Monkeypox].
PG  - 452-455
AB  - Monkeypox (MPX), is a rare endemic zoonotic disease of certain areas of Centraland West Africa. Nevertheless, in recent years, several outbreaks have occurredoutside the African continent. Monkeypox usually presents with a flu-likeprodromal period (fever, headache, chills, sweating) associated or followed bythe appearance of lymphadenopathy and a typical skin rash. Transmission issuspected to be direct or indirect via contact with saliva, respiratory droplets or skin lesions of infected animals or more rarely of humans. The gold standardfor diagnosis is the detection of MPX virus (MPXV) by PCR on skin lesion fluid.The evolution is usually favourable in 2 to 5 weeks but severe complications and sequelae are possible. In the absence of a specific treatment, the management is essentially supportive: appropriate local care, rehydration, analgesia andmanagement of eventual complications.

TI  - Head removal enhances planarian electrotaxis.
LID - jeb.243972 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.243972 [doi]
AB  - Certain animal species utilize electric fields for communication, hunting, andspatial orientation. Freshwater planarians move toward the cathode in a staticelectric field (cathodic electrotaxis). This planarian behavior was firstdescribed by Raymond Pearl more than a century ago. However, planarianelectrotaxis has received little attention since, and the underlying mechanismsand evolutionary significance remain unknown. To close this knowledge gap, wedeveloped an apparatus and scoring metrics for automated quantitative andmechanistic studies of planarian behavior upon exposure to a static electricfield. Using this automated setup, we characterized electrotaxis in the planarianDugesia japonica and found that this species responds to voltage instead of tocurrent, in contrast to results from previous studies using other planarianspecies. Surprisingly, we found differences in electrotaxis ability between small(shorter) and large (longer) planarians. To determine the cause of thesedifferences, we took advantage of the regenerative abilities of planarians andcompared electrotaxis in head, tail, and trunk fragments of various lengths. Wefound that tail and trunk fragments electrotaxed while head fragments did not,regardless of size. Based on these data, we hypothesized that signals from thehead may interfere with electrotaxis when the head area/body area reached acritical threshold. In support of this hypothesis, we found that (a) smallerintact planarians which cannot electrotax have a relatively largerhead-to-body-ratio than large planarians which can electrotax, and that (b)electrotaxis behavior of cut head fragments was negatively correlated with thehead-to-body ratio of the fragments. Moreover, we could restore cathodicelectrotaxis in head fragments via decapitation, directly demonstratinginhibition of electrotaxis by the head.

TI  - Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Reveals Unique Trends in Pathogen andParasitoid Infestations of Alfalfa Leafcutting Brood Cells.
LID - 8 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jisesa/ieac042 [doi]
AB  - The alfalfa leafcutting bee Megachile rotundata Fabricius (HYMENOPTERA:Megachilidae) is an important pollinator for multiple agricultural seedcommodities in the United States. M. rotundata is a solitary cavity nesting beethat forms brood nests where its larvae can develop. During the developmentalstages of growth, brood can be preyed upon by multiple different fungal pathogensand insect predators and parasitoids, resulting in the loss of the developinglarvae. Larval loss is a major concern for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seedproducers because they rely on pollination services provided by M. rotundata.Reduced pollination rates result in lower yields and increased production costs. In the present study, we examined the taxonomic composition of organisms foundwithin M. rotundata brood cells using a multiplex PCR assay which was developedfor the detection of bacterial, fungal, and invertebrate pests and pathogens ofM. rotundata larvae. Known pests of M. rotundata were detected, including membersof the fungal genus Ascosphaera, the causative agent of chalkbrood. The presence of multiple Ascosphaera species in a single brood cell was observed, withpotential implications for chalkbrood disease management. The multiplex assayalso identified DNA from more than 2,400 total species, including multiplepredators and pathogenetic species not previously documented in association with M. rotundata brood cells.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) remainthe most prevalent cancer immunotherapy both as a monotherapy and in combination with additional therapies. Despite the extensive success of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in the clinic, the experimental relationship between binding affinity and functional potency for anti-PD-1 antibodies in vivo has not been reported.Anti-PD-1 antibodies with higher and lower affinity than nivolumab orpembrolizumab are entering the clinic and show varied preclinical efficacy. Here,we explore the role of broad-ranging affinity variation within a single lineagein a syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model. By developing a panel of murineanti-PD-1 antibodies with varying affinity (ranging from KD = 20 pM - 15 nM), we find that there is a threshold affinity required for maximum efficacy at a given dose in the treatment of the MC38 adenocarcinoma model with anti-PD-1immunotherapy. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling complementsinterpretation of the experimental results and highlights the direct relationshipbetween dose, affinity, and PD-1 target saturation in the tumor.

AB  - Background Focused Ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) was proven apromising modality for non-invasive blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD).Herein, two devices for FUS-mediated BBBD in rodents are presented. Methods Atwo-axes robotic device was manufactured for navigating a single element FUStransducer of 1 MHz relative to the brain of rodents. A second more compactdevice featuring a single motorized vertical axis was also developed. Theirperformance was assessed in terms of motion accuracy, MRI compatibility andtrans-skull BBBD in wild type mice using MBs in synergy with pulsed FUS. Results Successful BBBD was evidenced by the Evans Blue dye method, as well as byFibronectin and Fibrinogen immunostaining. BBB permeability was enhanced when theapplied acoustic intensity was increased. Conclusions The proposed devicesconstitute a cost-effective and ergonomic solution for FUS-mediated BBBD in smallanimal models. Further experimentation is needed to examine the repeatability of results and optimize the therapeutic protocol. This article is protected bycopyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - An injectable thermosensitive hydrogel with a self-assembled peptide coupled withan antimicrobial peptide for enhanced wound healing.
LID - 10.1039/d2tb00644h [doi]
AB  - A wound dressing based on a thermosensitive hydrogel shows advantages overperformed traditional dressings, such as rapid reversible sol-gel-sol transition properties and the capacity to fill an irregular-shaped wound area. Herein,RA-Amps was fabricated by coupling a self-assembled peptide RADA16 with anantibacterial peptide (Amps) and incorporated into a PNIPAM hydrogel containingan MGF E peptide to develop a multi-functional composite hydrogel withthermo-response properties, good biocompatibility, good mechanical properties,and antibacterial and carrier functions for wound healing. PNI/RA-Amps is aninjectable thermo-reversible system with a phase transition temperature ofapproximately 32 degrees C, and exhibits a rapid reversible sol-gel-soltransition of approximately 23 s, which makes it conducive to sealing the woundarea and avoiding sol diffusion caused by a lengthy gel time. MGF E peptide wasloaded into a hydrogel and released continuously to promote fibroblastproliferation. Rat full-thickness skin experiments revealed that thePNI/RA-Amps/E hydrogel accelerates wound healing significantly by acceleratingepithelialization, the generation of new blood vessels and promoting thegeneration of collagen fiber compared with commercial dressing. Thus, ourfindings establish a new candidate for use as an injectable wound dressing forthe clinical treatment of wounds.

LID - 10.14814/phy2.15404 [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) results from the destruction of myelin and focalinflammation. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of hydroalcoholic extract ofUrtica dioica on oxidative stress, heat shock proteins, and brain histopathology in multiple sclerosis model. Sixty male C57BL/6 mice were divided into six groupsof 10. Groups included positive control, negative control, and treatment groupswith U. dioica extract at a dose of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg for 21 days(three times a week). The MS model was developed by a diet containing 0.2%cuprizone for 6 weeks. A section of brains was evaluated with Luxol Fast Bluestaining and the other part evaluated with heat shock protein (HSP) kits 60 and70, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA). In sections ofcorpus callosum, the highest amount of myelin was observed in the negativecontrols, while the use of cuprizone in the positive controls caused thedestruction and reduction of myelin. The use of U. dioica extract in therapeutic groups except at a dose of 50 mg/kg could reduce myelin degradation to someextent and lead to remyelination. However, myelin levels in treatment groups werenot significantly different from any of the negative and positive controls.Although HSP60 decreased in the treatment groups, there was no significantdifference between the positive and negative controls. Treatment with thisextract significantly reduced the amount of HSP70 compared with the positivecontrols. The decreased TAC and increased MDA in positive controls indicatedoxidative stress, respectively. Furthermore, the extract led to an increase anddecrease of TAC and MDA in the treatment groups, respectively. However, only the MDA level was significantly different from that of the positive controls.Therefore, the antioxidant effects of U. dioica extract could decreasecuprizone-induced oxidative stress and be effective in improving demyelination.

TI  - GCN5L1 impairs diastolic function in mice exposed to a high fat diet byrestricting cardiac pyruvate oxidation.
PG  - e15415
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15415 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is a structural and functional conditionthat precedes the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction(HFpEF). The etiology of diastolic dysfunction includes alterations in fuelsubstrate metabolism that negatively impact cardiac bioenergetics, and mayprecipitate the eventual transition to heart failure. To date, the molecularmechanisms that regulate early changes in fuel metabolism leading to diastolicdysfunction remain unclear. In this report, we use a diet-induced obesity modelin aged mice to show that inhibitory lysine acetylation of the pyruvatedehydrogenase (PDH) complex promotes energetic deficits that may contribute tothe development of diastolic dysfunction in mouse hearts. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the mitochondrial lysine acetylation regulatory protein GCN5L1prevented hyperacetylation of the PDH complex subunit PDHA1, allowing aged obese mice to continue using pyruvate as a bioenergetic substrate in the heart. Ourfindings suggest that changes in mitochondrial protein lysine acetylationrepresent a key metabolic component of diastolic dysfunction that precedes thedevelopment of heart failure.

TI  - Efficacy of leupeptin in treating ischemia in a rat hind limb model.
PG  - e15411
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15411 [doi]
AB  - Prolonged tourniquet use can lead to tissue ischemia and can cause progressivemuscle and nerve injuries. Such injuries are accompanied by calpain activationand subsequent Wallerian-like degeneration. Several known inhibitors, includingleupeptin, are known to impede the activity of calpain and associated tissuedamage. We hypothesize that employment of leupeptin in a rat model of prolongedhind limb ischemia can mitigate muscle and nerve injuries. Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 10) weighing between 300-400 g were employed in this study. Their left hindlimbs were subjected to blood flow occlusion for a period of 2-h using a neonatalblood pressure cuff. Five rats were given twice weekly intramuscular leupeptininjections, while the other five received saline. After 2 weeks, the animals wereeuthanized, their sciatic nerves and gastrocnemius muscles were harvested, fixed,stained, and analyzed using NIH Image J software. The administration of leupeptinresulted in larger gastrocnemius muscle fiber cross-sectional areas for the right(non-tourniquet applied) hindlimb as compared to that treated with the saline (p = 0.0110). However, no statistically significant differences were found betweenthese two groups for the injured left hindlimb (p = 0.1440). With regards to the sciatic nerve cross-sectional areas and sciatic functional index, no differences were detected between the leupeptin and control treated groups for both thehealthy and injured hindlimbs. This research provides new insights on how toemploy leupeptin to inhibit the degenerative effects of calpain and preservetissues following ischemia resulting from orthopedic or plastic surgeryprocedures.

AB  - An anthraquinone textile dye, Reactive Blue 4 (RB4), poses environmental healthhazards. In this study, remediation of RB4 (30-110 ppm) was carried out by hairy roots (HRs). UV-visible spectroscopy and FTIR analysis showed that the dyeundergoes decolourization followed by degradation. In addition, toxicity andsafety analyses of the bioremediated dye were performed on Allium cepa andzebrafish embryos, which revealed lesser toxicity of the bioremediated dye ascompared to untreated dye. For Allium cepa, the highest concentration, i.e., 110 ppm of the treated dye, showed less chromosomal aberrations with a mitotic index of 8.5 +/- 0.5, closer to control. Two-fold decrease in mortality of zebrafishembryos was observed at the highest treated dye concentration indicating toxicitymitigation. A higher level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was recorded in thezebrafish embryo when exposed to untreated dye, suggesting a possible role ofoxidative stress-inducing mortality of embryos. Further, the level of LPO wassignificantly normalized along with the other antioxidant enzymes in embryosafter dye bioremediation. At lower concentrations, mitigated samples displayedsimilar antioxidant activity comparable to control underlining the fact that the dye at lesser concentration can be more easily degraded than the dye at higherconcentration.

AB  - The somatotropic axis consists of genes associated with economic traits likemuscle growth and carcass traits in livestock. Insulin-like growth factor bindingproteins (IGFBPs) are the major proteins that play a vital role in thesomatotropic axis. The present study performed a genome-wide characterization of IGFBP genes in cattle. Genomic sequences of the IGFBP gene family for differentmammals (cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep) were recovered from the NCBI database.Sequence analyses were performed to investigate cattle's genomic variations inthe IGFBP gene family. Phylogenetic analysis, gene structure, motif patterns, andconserved domain analysis (CDA) of the IGFBP family revealed the evolutionarilyconserved nature of the IGFBP genes in cattle and other studied species.Physicochemical properties of IGFBP proteins in cattle revealed that most ofthese proteins are unstable, hydrophilic, thermostable, and acidic. Comparativeamino acid analysis revealed variations in all protein sequences with singleindels in IGFBP3 and IGFBP6. Mutation analysis revealed only one nonsynonymousmutation D212 > E in the IGFBP6 protein of cattle. A total of 245 nuclear hormonereceptor (NHRs) sites were detected, including 139 direct repeats (DR), 65everted repeats (ER), and 41 inverted repeats (IR). Out of 133 transcriptionfactors (TFs), 10 TFs (AHR, AHRARNT, AP4, CMYB, E47, EGR2, GATA, SP1, and SRF)had differential distribution (P value < 0.05) of putative transcriptionalbinding sites (TFBS) in cattle compared to buffalo. Synteny analysis revealed theconserved nature of genes between cattle and buffalo. Two gene pairs(IGFBP1/IGFBP3 and IGFBP2/IGFBP5) showed tandem duplication events in cattle and buffalo. This study highlights the functional importance of genomic variation in IGFBP genes and necessitates further investigations better to understand the roleand mechanisms of IGFBPs in bovines.

AB  - The present article describes a study of the effects of alpha-amylase(alpha-amylase) on the human neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, andLA-N-1. NB is the most common malignancy diagnosed in infants younger than 12months. Some clinical observations revealed an inverse association between therisk of NB development and breastfeeding. alpha-Amylase which is present inbreast milk was shown to have anticancer properties already in the beginning ofthe 20th century. Data presented here show that pancreatic alpha-amylase inhibitscell proliferation and has a direct impact on glucose uptake in the human NB celllines. Our results point out the importance of further research which couldelucidate the alpha-amylase mode of action and justify the presence of thisenzyme in breast milk as a possible inhibitor of NB development. alpha-Amylasecan be thus recognized as a potential safe and natural mild/host anticancer agentminimizing chemotherapy-related toxicity in the treatment of NB.

AB  - Selection of high yielding and stable maize hybrid requires effective method ofevaluation. Multienvironment evaluation is a critical step in plant breedingprograms that is aimed at selecting the ideal genotype in a wide range ofenvironments. A method of evaluation that combines a variety parameter ofstability could provide more accurate information to select the ideal genotype.The aims of the study were (i) to identify the effect of genotype, environment,and genotype x environment interactions (GEIs) on maize hybrid yields and (ii) toselect and to compare maize hybrids that have high and stable yields in diverseenvironments in Sumatra Island based on combined analysis, selection index, andGGE biplot. The study was conducted in five different environments in SumatraIsland, Indonesia, using a randomized complete block design repeated three times.Data were estimated using combined variance analysis, parametric andnonparametric stability, sustainability index, and GGE biplot. The results showedthat the genotype had a significant effect on maize hybrid yields with acontribution of 41.797%. The environment contributed to 24.314%, and GEIscontributed 33.889% of the total variation. E1 (Karo, South Sumatra; dry season) and E3 (Tanjung Bintang, Lampung; dry season) were identified as the most idealenvironments (representative) for testing the hybrids for wider adaptability. Themaize hybrid with high and stable yields can be selected based on combinedstability analysis and sustainability index as well as GGE biplot. These threemethods are effectively selected high yielding and stable genotypes when they areused together. The three maize hybrids, namely, MH2, MH8, and MH9, arerecommended as high yielding and stable genotype candidates.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aimed to develop gefitinib-loaded solid lipidnanoparticles (GEF-SLN), and GEF-loaded PEGylated SLN (GEF-P-SLN) for targetingmetastatic lung cancer through the lymphatic system. Methods: The prepared SLNswere characterized in terms of physicochemical properties, entrapment efficiency,and in-vitro release. Furthermore, ex-vivo permeability was investigated usingthe rabbit intestine. Cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects were studied againstA549 cell lines as a model for lung cancer. Results: The present results revealedthat the particle size and polydispersity index of the prepared formulationsrange from 114 to 310 nm and 0.066 to 0.350, respectively, with negativezeta-potential (-14 to -27.6). Additionally, SLN and P-SLN showed remarkableentrapment efficiency above 89% and exhibited sustained-release profiles. Thepermeability study showed that GEF-SLN and GEF-P-SLN enhanced the permeability ofGEF by 1.71 and 2.64-fold, respectively, compared with GEF suspension.Cytotoxicity showed that IC50 of pure GEF was 3.5 mug/mL, which decreased to 1.95and 1.8 mug/mL for GEF-SLN and GEF-P-SLN, respectively. Finally, the apoptoticstudy revealed that GEF-P-SLN decreased the number of living cells from 49.47 to 3.43 when compared with pure GEF. Conclusion: These results concluded thatGEF-P-SLN is a promising approach to improving the therapeutic outcomes of GEF inthe treatment of metastatic lung cancer.

AB  - Background: With high malignancy, retinoblastoma (RB) commonly occurs in infants and has incredible difficulty with the early diagnosis. In recent years, theintegrated theranostics of multimodal imaging-guided therapy has shown promising potential for oncotherapy. Purpose: To prepare folate/magnetic dual-targettheranostic nanoparticles integrating with US/PA/MR imaging and the synergisticphotothermal treatment (PTT)/photodynamic treatment (PDT) for the early diagnosisand timely intervention of RB cancer. Methods: Folate/magnetic dual-targetcationic nanoliposomes (CN) encapsulating indocyanine green (ICG) andperfluorohexane(PFH)(FA-CN-PFH-ICG-Fe3O4, FCNPIFE) were synthesized andcharacterized. Then we evaluated their targeting ability, US/PA/MR imagingeffects, and the efficacy of synergistic PTT/PDT in vitro and in vivo. Finally,we explored the mechanism of synergistic PTT/PDT in Y79 tumor-bearing mice.Results: FCNPIFEs were stable and uniform in 7 days. They showed excellent invitro targeting ability with a 95.29% cell uptake rate. The in vitro US/PA/MRIimaging results of FCNPIFEs showed a concentration-dependent manner, and in vitrotherapy FCNPIFEs exhibited an enhanced anticancer efficacy against Y79 cells. In vivo analysis confirmed that FCNPIFEs enabled a targeted synergistic PTT/PDTunder US/PA/MR imaging guidance in Y79 tumor-bearing mice, achieving almostcomplete tumor regression. Immunofluorescence results displayed weakerfluorescence intensity compared with other single treatment groups, confirmingthat PTT/PDT synergistic therapy effect was achieved by down-regulating theexpression of HIF-1alpha and HSP70. Conclusion: FCNPIFEs were verified aspromising theranostic nanoliposomes for RB oncotherapy and showed great potentialin clinical application.

AB  - Background: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), for which the bioactive metabolite ismycophenolic acid (MPA), is a frequently used immunosuppressant for systemiclupus erythematosus (SLE). However, its short half-life and poor biodistribution into cells and tissues hinder its clinical efficacy. Our dextranmycophenolate-based nanoparticles (MPA@Dex-MPA NPs) have greatly improved thepharmacokinetics of MMF/MPA. We here tested the therapeutic efficacy ofMPA@Dex-MPA NPs against SLE and investigated the underlying mechanism. Methods:The tissue and immune cell biodistributions of MPA@Dex-MPA NPs were traced using live fluorescence imaging system and flow cytometry, respectively. Serologicalproinflammatory mediators and kidney damage were detected to assess the efficacy of MPA@Dex-MPA NPs treatments of MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. Immune cell changes inthe kidney and spleen were further analyzed post-treatment via flow cytometry.Bone marrow-derived macrophages were used to investigate the potential mechanism.Results: MPA@Dex-MPA NPs exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy and safety inthe MRL/lpr mice using significantly lower administration dosage (one-fifth) and frequency (once/3 days) compared to MMF/MPA used in ordinary practice. Theoverall prognosis of the mice was improved as they showed lower levels ofserological proinflammatory mediators. Moreover, kidney injury was alleviatedwith reduced pathological signs and decreased urine protein-creatinine ratio.Further investigations of the underlying mechanism revealed a preferentialpenetration and persistent retention of MPA@Dex-MPA NPs in the spleen and kidney,where they were mostly phagocytosed by macrophages. The macrophages were found tobe polarized towards a CD206(+) M2-like phenotype, with a downregulation ofsurface CD80 and CD40, and reduced TNF-alpha production in the spleen and kidney and in vitro. The expansion of T cells was also significantly inhibited in these two organs. Conclusion: Our research improved the efficacy of MPA for MRL/lprmice through synthesizing MPA@Dex-MPA NPs to enhance its tissue biodistributionand explored the possible mechanism, providing a promising strategy for SLEtherapy.

TI  - Sciatic-Vagal Nerve Stimulation by Electroacupuncture Alleviates InflammatoryArthritis in Lyme Disease-Susceptible C3H Mice.
PG  - 930287
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.930287 [doi]
AB  - Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, and the pathogenesis of thedisease is complex with both bacterial and host factors contributing toinflammatory responses. Lyme disease affects different organs including jointsand results in arthritis. Immune responses stimulated by B. burgdorferi throughtoll-like receptors cause infiltration of leukocytes, which produce inflammatory cytokines and facilitate spirochete clearance. However, arthritic manifestations and chronic fatigue syndrome-like symptoms persist long after completion ofantibiotic treatment regimens in a significant number of patients. To counter theeffects of inflammation, treatment by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,hydroxychloroquine, or synovectomy to eradicate inflammatory arthritis in theinvolved joint could be employed; however, they often have long-termconsequences. Acupuncture has been used for a long time in Asian medicine todiminish pain during various ailments, but the effects and its mechanism are justbeginning to be explored. Control of inflammation by neuronal stimulation hasbeen exploited as a systemic therapeutic intervention to arrest inflammatoryprocesses. Our objective was to determine whether activation of the sciatic-vagalnetwork by electroacupuncture on ST36 acupoint, which is used to control systemicinflammation in experimental models of infectious disorders such as endotoxemia, can also alleviate Lyme arthritis symptoms in mice. This aim was furtherstrengthened by the reports that sciatic-vagal neuronal network stimulation canlead to dopamine production in the adrenal medulla and moderate the production ofinflammatory factors. We first assessed whether electroacupuncture affectsspirochete colonization to attenuate Lyme arthritis. Interestingly,bioluminescent B. burgdorferi burden detected by live imaging and qPCR weresimilar in electroacupuncture- and mock-treated mice, while electroacupunctureinduced a lasting anti-inflammatory effect on mice. Despite the discontinuationof treatment at 2 weeks, the simultaneous decrease in neutrophils in the jointsand inflammatory cytokine levels throughout the body at 4 weeks suggests asystemic and persistent effect of electroacupuncture that attenuates Lymearthritis. Our results suggest that electroacupuncture-mediated anti-inflammatoryresponses could offer promising healthcare benefits in patients suffering fromlong-term Lyme disease manifestations.

AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro antiviral activities and the ex vivoimmunomodulatory effects of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (HC) ethanolic extracts in response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Inaddition, this study evaluated the in vivo effects of oral supplementation of HC extract on immune responses to and cross-protective efficacy of PRRSV-1modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine against the highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV-2challenge. In vitro experiments demonstrated that HC extracted in either 50%,70%, or 95% ethanol (referred to as HC50, HC70, and HC95, respectively)significantly interfered with PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Ex vivoexperiments revealed that all HC extracts significantly enhanced mRNA expressionsof type I interferon-regulated genes, type I and II interferon (IFN), and pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in HP-PRRSV-2-inoculated monocyte-derivedmacrophages. An in vivo experiment included four groups of six pigs (4 weeks old;n = 24). Group 1 and group 2 were vaccinated with the PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine at 0dpv (day post vaccination). Group 2 also received oral administration of HC50extract at 0-49 dpv. Group 3 received the PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine solvent at 0 dpv,while group 4 served as strict control. Groups 1-3 were challenged intranasallywith HP-PRRSV-2 at 28 dpv and immune-related and clinical parameters weremonitored weekly until 49 dpv. Compared to group 1, group 2 demonstratedsignificantly increased IFN regulatory factor 3 mRNA expression of PRRSV-recalledperipheral blood mononuclear cells, and significantly reduced HP-PRRSV-2 viremia.No difference in PRRSV-specific antibody responses, rectal temperature, clinical scores, and average daily weight gain was detected. Our study reports theimmunomodulatory and anti-PRRSV potentials of HC extract in PRRSV-1MLV-vaccinated/HP-PRRSV-2 challenged pigs.

PG  - 923031
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.923031 [doi]
AB  - Background: We aimed to characterize serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1(SPINK1) as a gene signature for the early diagnosis, molecular targeting, andprediction of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment response ofhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The transcriptomics, proteomics, andphenotypic analyses were performed separately or in combination. Results: Weobtained the following findings on SPINK1. Firstly, in the transcriptomictraining dataset, which included 279 stage I and II tumor samples (out of 1,884stage I-IV HCC specimens) and 259 normal samples, significantly higher area undercurve (AUC) values and increased integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were demonstrated for HCC discriminationin SPINK1-associated models compared with those of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Thecalibration of both SPINK1-related curves fitted significantly better than thatof AFP. In the two independent transcriptomic validation datasets, which included201, 103 stage I-II tumor and 192, 169 paired non-tumor specimens, respectively, the obtained results were consistent with the above-described findings. In theproteomic training dataset, which included 98 stage I and II tumor and 165 normaltissue samples, the analyses also revealed better AUCs and increased IDI and NRI in the aforementioned SPINK1-associated settings. A moderate calibration wasshown for both SPINK1-associated models relative to the poor results of AFP.Secondly, in the in vitro and/or in vivo murine models, the wet-lab experimentsdemonstrated that SPINK1 promoted the proliferation, clonal formation, migration,chemoresistance, anti-apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and metastasis of HCC cells,while the anti-SPINK1 antibody inhibited the growth of the cells, suggesting thatSPINK1 has "tumor marker" and "targetable" characteristics in the management ofHCC. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)analyses revealed that SPINK1 was engaged in immunity-related pathways, includingT-cell activation. Thirdly, in the transcriptomic analyses of the 368 HCCspecimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, the high abundance ofSPINK1 was positively correlated with the high levels of activatedtumor-infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and dendritic and naturalkiller cells, while there were also positive correlations between SPINK1 andimmune checkpoints, including PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, and CTLA-4. The ESTIMATE algorithm calculated positive correlations between SPINK1 and the immuneand ESTIMATE scores, suggesting a close correlation between SPINK1 and theimmunogenic microenvironment within HCC tissues, which may possibly help inpredicting the response of patients to ICB therapy. Conclusions: SPINK1 could be a potential biomarker for the early detection, targeted therapy, and predictionof ICB treatment response in the management of HCC.

AB  - The T cell receptor Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells bridge innate and adaptiveantimicrobial immunity in primates. These Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells respond tophosphoantigens (pAgs) present in microbial or eukaryotic cells in a butyrophilin3A1 (BTN3) and butyrophilin 2A1 (BTN2A1) dependent manner. In humans, the rapidexpansion of circulating Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes during several infectionsas well as their localization at the site of active disease demonstrates theirimportant role in the immune response to infection. However, Vgamma9Vdelta2 Tcell deficiencies have been observed in some infectious diseases such as activetuberculosis and chronic viral infections. In this review, we are providing anoverview of the mechanisms of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-mediated antimicrobialimmunity. These cells kill infected cells mainly by releasing lytic mediators andpro-inflammatory cytokines and inducing target cell apoptosis. In addition, therelease of chemokines and cytokines allows the recruitment and activation ofimmune cells, promoting the initiation of the adaptive immune response. Finaly,we also describe potential new therapeutic tools of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-basedimmunotherapy that could be applied to emerging infections.

AB  - Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is a commonarrhythmia. Growing evidence suggests that family aggregation and genetic factorsare involved in AVNRT. However, in families with a history of AVNRT,disease-causing genes have not been reported. Objective: To investigate thegenetic contribution of familial AVNRT using a whole-exome sequencing (WES)approach. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 20 patients from ninefamilies with a history of AVNRT and 100 control participants, and wesystematically analyzed mutation profiles using WES. Gene-based burden analysis, integration of previous sporadic AVNRT data, pedigree-based co-segregation,protein-protein interaction network analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, andconfirmation of animal phenotype were performed. Results: Among 95 relatedreference genes, seven candidate pathogenic genes have been identified both insporadic and familial AVNRT, including CASQ2, AGXT, ANK2, SYNE2, ZFHX3, GJD3, andSCN4A. Among the 37 reference genes from sporadic AVNRT, five candidatepathogenic genes were identified in patients with both familial and sporadicAVNRT: LAMC1, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), COL4A3, NOS1, and ATP2C2. To identify the common pathogenic mechanisms in all AVNRT cases, five pathogenic genes wereidentified in patients with both familial and sporadic AVNRT: LAMC1, RYR2,COL4A3, NOS1, and ATP2C2. Considering the unique internal candidate pathogenicgene within pedigrees, three genes, TRDN, CASQ2, and WNK1, were likely to be the pathogenic genes in familial AVNRT. Notably, the core calcium-signaling pathwaymay be closely associated with the occurrence of AVNRT, including CASQ2, RYR2,TRDN, NOS1, ANK2, and ATP2C2. Conclusion: Our pedigree-based studies demonstrate that RYR2 and related calcium signaling pathway play a critical role in thepathogenesis of familial AVNRT using the WES approach.

AB  - Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives andProducts or substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP Panel) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety of the coccidiostat Aviax 5% (semduramicinsodium) when used in feed for chickens for fattening. In a previous assessment,the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the taxonomical identification of theproduction strain at species level and on the absence of genetic determinants forantimicrobial resistance. In addition, the Panel could not conclude on the safetyfor the target animals and could not set maximum residue limits to protectconsumers. Regarding the safety for the environment, although the use of theadditive was considered safe for the terrestrial compartment, a risk for theaquatic compartment and for groundwater pollution could not be excluded. Based onthe new data provided, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that there are no safetyconcerns for the target animals, consumer, user and environment regarding theproduction strain of semduramicin sodium. Based on the results in the tolerancetrial, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive is safe for chickens forfattening up to the maximum recommended level (25 mg/kg complete feed), but nomargin of safety can be established. The use of semduramicin sodium at a maximum level of 25 mg/kg complete feed for chickens for fattening is safe for consumers with no withdrawal time. Based on the new data provided and the currentrequirements for environmental risk assessment, the use of semduramicin sodiumfrom Aviax 5% in feed for chickens for fattening up to 25 mg/kg complete feeddoes not pose a risk for groundwater nor for aquatic and sediment compartments,while a risk for the terrestrial compartment cannot be excluded. Thebioaccumulation and the risk for secondary poisoning are considered to be low.

AB  - Beyond the role of mitochondria in apoptosis initiation/execution, somemitochondrial adaptations support the metastasis and chemoresistance of cancercells. This highlights mitochondria as a promising target for new anticancerstrategies. Emergent evidence suggests that some snake venom toxins, bothproteins with enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities, act on the mitochondrialmetabolism of cancer cells, exhibiting unique and novel mechanisms that are notyet fully understood. Currently, six toxin classes (L-amino acid oxidases,thrombin-like enzymes, secreted phospholipases A2, three-finger toxins,cysteine-rich secreted proteins, and snake C-type lectin) that alter themitochondrial bioenergetics have been described. These toxins act through ComplexIV activity inhibition, OXPHOS uncoupling, ROS-mediated permeabilization of innermitochondrial membrane (IMM), IMM reorganization by cardiolipin interaction, and mitochondrial fragmentation with selective migrastatic and cytotoxic effects oncancer cells. Notably, selective internalization and direct action of snake venomtoxins on tumor mitochondria can be mediated by cell surface proteinsoverexpressed in cancer cells (e.g. nucleolin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans) or facilitated by the elevated Deltapsim of cancer cells compared to thatnon-tumor cells. In this latter case, selective mitochondrial accumulation, in a Deltapsim-dependent manner, of compounds linked to cationic snake peptides may beexplored as a new anti-cancer drug delivery system. This review analyzes theeffect of snake venom toxins on mitochondrial bioenergetics of cancer cells,whose mechanisms of action may offer the opportunity to develop new anticancerdrugs based on toxin scaffolds.

AB  - Tibetan medicine is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine and asignificant representative of ethnic medicine in China. Tibetan medicine isgradually recognized by the world for its unique curative effects. Wuwei Shexiangpills (WPW) has been widely used to treat "Zhenbu" disease (Also known asrheumatoid arthritis) in Tibetan medicine, however, its potential bioactiveingredients and mechanism for RA treatment remain unclear. In this study, we useda combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-fight mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), network analysis and experimental validation to elucidate thepotential pharmacodynamic substances and mechanisms of WPW in the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results showed that songoramine, cheilanthifoline,saussureanine C, acoric acid, arjunolic acid, peraksine, ellagic acid, arjungeninand other 11 components may be the main activities of WPW in the treatment of RA.PIK3CA, AKT, MAPK, IL-6, TNF, MMP1, MMP3, and CDK1 are considered as coretargets. PI3K-AKT, MAPK, apoptosis, cell cycle, and other signaling pathways may be the key pathways for WPW to play a role in the treatment of RA. Furthermore,we validated the underlying molecular mechanism of WPW predicted by networkanalysis and demonstrated its possible mechanism through in vivo animalexperiments. It was found that WPW could significantly improve the degree of paw swelling, and reduce ankle joint diameter and arthritis index. Furtherhistomorphological analysis showed that WPW could reduce the degree of synovialtissue inflammation and ankle joint cartilage damage. Meanwhile, WPW coulddown-regulate the levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-17, and increase the levels ofIL-10 and IL-4 in the serum of AA rats. TUNEL staining confirmed that WPW couldsignificantly promote the apoptosis of synovial cells. Moreover, theimmunohistochemical results showed that WPW decreased the expression of PI3K,AKT, MAPK, MMP1, MMP3, CDK1, and Bcl-2, as well as increased the expression ofBax protein. In conclusion, we successfully combined GC-MS, UPLC-Q-TOF/MS,network analysis, and experimental validation strategies to elucidate theinhibition of inflammation by WPW in AA model rats via PI3K/AKT, MAPK, cell cycleand apoptotic pathways process. This not only provides new evidence for the studyof potential pharmacodynamic substances and the mechanism of WPW in the treatmentof RA, but also provides ideas for the study of other Tibetan medicine compoundpreparations.

AB  - Background: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes substantial publichealth problems and endangers the development of animal husbandry in endemicareas. Early diagnosis of infected animals and humans is a crucial step inreducing the incidence of brucellosis. In this study, we designed differentcombinations of Brucella major outer membrane proteins (omps) including omp10,omp16, omp19, omp25, omp31 and BP26 as antigens and evaluated their efficiency inserodiagnosis for brucellosis. The efficiency assay was conducted using themethod of indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) together with acollection of brucellosis-positive sera and healthy sera from multiple species(161 from human, 120 from goat and 144 from cattle). The diagnostic effectivenessof each omp combination was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curve with the software GraphPad Prism version 6.05. Results: Theomp25/omp31/BP26 combination showed the best efficiency in diagnosis for humanbrucellosis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.995 and, compared with the serum tube agglutination test (SAT) and the Rose Bengal plate agglutination test (RBPT), the positive and negative diagnostic accuracies of iELISA were 94.59%(105/111) and 100.0% (50/50), respectively. Evaluation of the 120 goat and 144cattle serum samples showed that the best combination for diagnosing bothomp31/BP26, the AUC was 0.9262 in goat and 0.9344 in cattle, and compared withthose of SAT and RBPT, the positive and negative diagnostic accuracies in goatwere 72.73% (48/66) and 100.0% (54/54), respectively. The positive and negativediagnostic accuracies in cattle were 79.79% (75/94) and 100.0% (50/50),respectively. Cross-reaction assays showed that omp25/omp31/BP26 and omp31/BP26do not cross with other common pathogens. Conclusion: The results indicated that combinations of omps, as protein antigens, can be used to diagnose brucellosiswith high accuracy in human, goat and cattle.

AB  - Introduction: Chikungunya is caused by an alpha virus transmitted to humans by aninfected mosquito. Infection is generally considered to be self-limiting andnon-critical. Chikungunya infection may be diagnosed by severe joint pain withfever, but it is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of chikungunya arecommon to many pathogens, including dengue fever. Diagnosis mainly depends onviral culture, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and IgM ELISA. Early and accurate diagnosis of the virus can be achieved by theapplication of PCR methods, but the high cost and the need for a thermal cyclerrestrict the use of such methods. On the other hand, antibody-based IgM ELISA is considered to be inexpensive, but antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV)only develop after 4 days of infection, so it has limited application in theearlier diagnosis of viral infection and the management of patients. Because ofthese challenges, a simple antigen-based sensitive, specific, and rapid detectionmethod is required for the early and accurate clinical diagnosis of chikungunya. Methods: The amino acid sequence of CHIKV ectodomain E1 and E2 proteins wasanalyzed using bioinformatics tools to determine the antigenic residues,particularly the B-cell epitopes and their characteristics. Recombinant E2-E1CHIKV antigen was used for the development of polyclonal antibodies in hamstersand IgG was purified. Serological tests of 96 CHIKV patients were conducted byantigen-capture ELISA using primary antibodies raised against rCHIKV E2-E1 inhamsters and human anti-CHIKV antibodies. Results: We observed high specificityand sensitivity, of 100% and 95.8%, respectively, and these values demonstratethe efficiency of the test as a clinical diagnostic tool. There was nocross-reactivity with samples taken from dengue patients. Discussion: Our simple and sensitive sandwich ELISA for the early-phase detection of CHIKV infection maybe used to improve the diagnosis of chikungunya.

AB  - Environmental conditions during early-life development can have lasting effectsshaping individual heterogeneity in fitness and fitness-related traits. Thelength of telomeres, the DNA sequences protecting chromosome ends, may beaffected by early-life conditions, and telomere length (TL) has been associatedwith individual performance within some wild animal populations. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms that generate variation in TL, and the relationship between TL and fitness, is important in understanding the role of telomeres in ecology andlife-history evolution. Here, we investigate how environmental conditions andmorphological traits are associated with early-life blood TL and if TL predictsnatal dispersal probability or components of fitness in 2746 wild house sparrow(Passer domesticus) nestlings from two populations sampled across 20 years(1994-2013). We retrieved weather data and we monitored population fluctuations, individual survival, and reproductive output using field observations and geneticpedigrees. We found a negative effect of population density on TL, but only inone of the populations. There was a curvilinear association between TL and themaximum daily North Atlantic Oscillation index during incubation, suggesting thatthere are optimal weather conditions that result in the longest TL. Disperserstended to have shorter telomeres than non-dispersers. TL did not predictsurvival, but we found a tendency for individuals with short telomeres to havehigher annual reproductive success. Our study showed how early-life TL is shaped by effects of growth, weather conditions, and population density, supporting thatenvironmental stressors negatively affect TL in wild populations. In addition,shorter telomeres may be associated with a faster pace-of-life, as individualswith higher dispersal rates and annual reproduction tended to have shorterearly-life TL.

TI  - Resource requirements for ecosystem conservation: A combined industrial andnatural ecology approach to quantifying natural capital use in nature.
PG  - e9132
LID - 10.1002/ece3.9132 [doi]
AB  - Socioeconomic demand for natural capital is causing catastrophic losses ofbiodiversity and ecosystem functionality, most notably in regions wheresocioeconomic-and eco-systems compete for natural capital, e.g., energy (animalor plant matter). However, a poor quantitative understanding of what naturalcapital is needed to support biodiversity in ecosystems, while at the same timesatisfy human development needs-those associated with human development withinsocioeconomic systems-undermines our ability to sustainably manage global stocks of natural capital. Here we describe a novel concept and accompanying methodology(relating the adult body mass of terrestrial species to their requirements forland area, water, and energy) to quantify the natural capital needed to supportterrestrial species within ecosystems, analogous to how natural capital use byhumans is quantified in a socioeconomic context. We apply this methodology toquantify the amount of natural capital needed to support species observed using aspecific surveyed site in Scotland. We find that the site can support a largerassemblage of species than those observed using the site; a primary aim of therewilding project taking place there. This method conceptualises, for the firsttime, a comprehensive "dual-system" approach: modelling natural capital use insocioeconomic-and eco-systems simultaneously. It can facilitate the management ofnatural capital at the global scale, and in both the conservation and creation(e.g., rewilding) of biodiversity within managed ecosystems, representing anadvancement in determining what socioeconomic trade-offs are needed to achievecontemporary conservation targets alongside ongoing human development.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the effective components and possible mechanism of actionof Lavandula angustifolia Mill. essential oil (LEO) in preventing vomitingthrough the olfactory pathway. Materials and Methods: A new networkpharmacology-based method was established to analyze main components and pathwaysof LEO involved in antiemetic effects by introducing component content;biological activities of key proteins of the olfactory pathway and theircorresponding compounds were verified by molecular docking technique; and finallypica in a rat model was established to verify the molecular mechanism ofantiemetic effects of LEO by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) todetermine the serum 5-HT, substance P, and DA levels in each group and byimmunohistochemistry to determine the contents of 5-HT3R, CaMKII and ERK1/2proteins in the medulla oblongata tissue. Results: Network pharmacology combined with molecular docking analysis showed that the mechanism of the antiemeticeffect of LEO may be related to (2Z)-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienyl acetate, linalylacetate, butanoic acid, hexyl ester, 4-hexen-1-ol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)-,acetate, .tau.-cadinol and other active ingredients, which regulate the cyclicadenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway and the expression of BRAF, PDE and other targets on the pathway. An ELISA revealed that LEO reduced the levelsof 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), substance P, and dopamine in serum compared withthe model group (P <0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LEO decreasedthe expression of 5-HT3R, CaMKII, and ERK1/2 proteins in the medulla oblongata ofrats compared with the model group (P <0.01). Conclusion: LEO may achieve theantiemetic effect by reducing the content of 5-HT and inhibiting its relatedreceptors, thereby regulating downstream Ca(2+)/CaMKII/ERK1/2 pathway of the cAMPsignaling pathway.

AB  - Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and ischaracterized by high malignancy, occult incidence and poor prognosis.Traditional chemotherapy drugs have limited efficacy and strong side effects.Therefore, there is an urgent need for a better treatment of the malignancy.Methods: The prepared arginine glycine peptide (RGD)-human serum albumin(HSA)-Gemcitabine (GEM)/Curcumin (CUR) nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized forphysicochemical properties, stability and in vitro release. Comparisons ofHSA-GEM/CUR NPs and RGD-HSA-GEM/CUR NPs regarding tissue distributions andpharmacodynamics were also carried out using mice as the animal models. Results: Transmission electron micrographs showed that RGD peptide-conjugated HSA-NPs had an irregular surface, good dispersion (PDI=0.139+/-0.03) and a uniform sizedistribution (Mean PS=115.6+/-5.7 nm). The zeta-potential was -17.3 mV. Asregards in vitro release, non RGD modified NPs showed a faster release rate in 24hours, yielding a release amount of 75% for GEM and 72% for CUR. RGD-HSA-GEM/CUR NPs exhibited 67% of accumulated release of GEM (63% for CUR) in 24 hours. Thismay be due to the HSA chain covering the surface of NPs, which hindered the drug release. The cytotoxicity of GEM/CUR co-loaded NPs was significantly higher than that of single-drug NPs (P < 0.05). In vivo study results indicated thatRGD-HSA-GEM/CUR NPs had notable targeting effect on subcutaneous tumors, with apotential to actively deliver drugs to tumor tissues. Conclusion: In this study, we prepared RGD-HSA-GEM/CUR NPs that had both good water solubility andtumor-targeting property. The results also showed that the RGD modified NPs hadadvantages in increasing GEM/CUR concentration at tumor sites and reducing itsdistribution in peripheral organs.

AB  - Purpose: Streptococcus agalactiae is one of the primary pathogens responsible forsubclinical mastitis, a significant economic burden for dairy farms. An essentialcomponent of the immune response to infection is ubiquitination, which playsimportant roles in the complex interactions between the pathogen and host.Materials and Methods: In the present study, quantitative ubiquitylomics wasperformed to profile changes in the global ubiquitinome of bovine mammary glandepithelial cells (BMECs) infected with S. agalactiae. Results: The most notablechanges in the BMEC ubiquitinome were related to the adherens junction, ribosome,and tight junction pathways. Ubiquitination of CTNNB1, EGFR, ITGB1, CTNNA1,CTNNA2, CDH1, YES1, and SLC9A3R1 appears to be fundamental for regulatingmultiple cellular processes in BMECs in response to S. agalactiae infection. Inaddition, broad ubiquitination of various effectors and outer membrane proteinswas observed. Ubiquitinated proteins in S. agalactiae-infected BMECs wereassociated with regulating cell junctions in the host, with potentialimplications for susceptibility to infection. Conclusion: The preliminaryfindings suggest that extensive ubiquitination of CTNNB1, CDH1 and SLC9A3R1 andproteins closely related to cell junctions might play an important role inmastitis progression in dairy cows. The results provide evidence that ubiquitinmodification of certain proteins in S. agalactiae-infected BMECs could be apromising therapeutic strategy for reducing mammary gland injury and mastitis.

TI  - IFN-gamma and LPS Induce Synergistic Expression of CCL2 in Monocytic Cells viaH3K27 Acetylation.
PG  - 4291-4302
LID - 10.2147/JIR.S368352 [doi]
AB  - Background: Overexpression of CCL2 (MCP-1) has been implicated in pathogenesis ofmetabolic conditions, such as obesity and T2D. However, the mechanisms leading toincreased CCL2 expression in obesity are not fully understood. Since bothIFN-gamma and LPS levels are found to be elevated in obesity and shown to beinvolved in the regulation of metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance, weinvestigated whether these two agents could synergistically trigger theexpression of CCL2 in obesity. Methods: Monocytes (Human monocytic THP-1 cells)were stimulated with IFN-gamma and LPS. CCL2 gene expression was determined byreal-time RT-PCR. CCL2 protein was determined by ELISA. Signaling pathways wereidentified by using epigenetic inhibitors and STAT1 siRNA. Acetylation of H3K27was analyzed by Western blotting. The acetylation level of histone H3K27 in thetranscriptional initiation region of CCL2 gene was determined by ChIP-qPCR.Results: Our results show that the co-incubation of THP-1 monocytes withIFN-gamma and LPS significantly enhanced the expression of CCL2, compared totreatment with IFN-gamma or LPS alone. Similar results were obtained usingprimary monocytes and macrophages. Interestingly, IFN-gamma priming was found to be more effective than LPS priming in inducing synergistic expression of CCL2.Moreover, STAT1 deficiency significantly suppressed this synergy for CCL2expression. Mechanistically, we showed that IFN-gamma priming induced acetylationof lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27ac) in THP-1 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) assay followed by qRT-PCR revealed increased H3K27ac at the CCL2 promoter proximal region, resulting in stabilized gene expression. Furthermore, inhibitionof histone acetylation with anacardic acid suppressed this synergistic response, whereas trichostatin A (TSA) could substitute IFN-gamma in this synergy.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that IFN-gamma, in combination with LPS, has thepotential to augment inflammation via the H3K27ac-mediated induction of CCL2 inmonocytic cells in the setting of obesity.

AB  - Purpose: Sepsis-induced liver failure is a kind of liver injury with a highmortality, and ferroptosis plays a key role in this disease. Our research aims toscreen ferroptosis-related genes in sepsis-induced liver failure as targetedtherapy for patients with liver failure. Methods: Using the limma software, weanalyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the GSE60088 datasetdownloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Clusterprofiler wasapplied for enrichment analysis of DEGs enrichment function. Then, theferroptosis-related genes of the mice in the FerrDb database were crossed withDEGs. Sepsis mice model were prepared by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP).ALT and AST in the serum of mice were measured using detection kit. Thepathological changes of the liver tissues in mice were observed byhematoxylin-eosin (H & E) staining. We detected the apoptosis of mice livertissues using TUNEL. The expression of Hmox1, Epas1, Sirt1, Slc3a2, Jun, Plin2and Zfp36 were detected by qRT-PCR. Results: DEGs analysis showed 136up-regulated and 45 down-regulated DEGs. Meanwhile, we found that theup-regulated DEGs were enriched in pathways including the cytokine biosynthesisprocess while the down-regulated DEGs were enriched in pathways such as organichydroxy compound metabolic process. In this study, seven genes (Hmox1, Epas1,Sirt1, Slc3a2, Jun, Plin2 and Zfp36) were obtained through the intersection ofFerrDb database and DEGs. However, immune infiltration analysis revealed thatferroptosis-related genes may promote the development of liver failure through B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Finally, it was confirmed by theconstruction of septic liver failure mice model that ferroptosis-related genes ofHmox1, Slc3a2, Jun and Zfp36 were significantly correlated with liver failure andwere highly expressed. Conclusion: The identification of ferroptosis-relatedgenes Hmox1, Slc3a2, Jun and Zfp36 in the present study contribute to ourunderstanding of the molecular mechanism of sepsis-induced liver failure, andprovide candidate targets for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

LID - 10.7717/peerj.13783 [doi]
AB  - Noncoding RNAs have been implicated in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury (SCI), including cell death, glial scar formation, axonal collapse anddemyelination, and inflammation. The evidence suggests that exercise therapy isjust as effective as medical treatment in SCI. However, studies of competingendogenous RNA (ceRNA)-mediated regulation mechanisms in the therapy of SCI with exercise are rare. The focus of this research was to investigate the effect ofexercise therapy on the expression levels of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA),microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA in rats with SCI. The RNA-seq technology has been usedto examine the differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs), lncRNAs (DELs), miRNAs(DEMs), and genes (DEGs) between SCI and exercise therapy rats. The ceRNA networkwas established using interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs, as well as betweenmiRNAs and lncRNAs/circRNAs. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, andIntegrated Discovery was used to anticipate the underlying functions of mRNAs.Our current study identified 76 DELs, 33 DEMs, and 30 DEGs between groups of SCI rats and exercise therapy rats. Subsequently, these newly discovered ceRNAinteraction axes could be important targets for the exercise treatment of SCI.

LID - 10.7717/peerj.13713 [doi]
AB  - Background: Plasmodium falciparum and tissue dwelling helminth parasites areendemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The geographical overlap in co-infection is a common phenomenon. However, there is continued paucity of information on howthe co-infection influence the blood glucose and insulin profiles in the infectedhost. Animal models are ideal to elucidate effects of co-infection on diseaseoutcomes and hence, blood glucose, insulin and glycogen profiles were assessed inSprague-Dawley rats co-infected with P. berghei ANKA (Pb) and Trichinellazimbabwensis (Tz), a tissue-dwelling nematode. Methods:One-hundred-and-sixty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight range 90-150 g) wererandomly divided into four separate experimental groups: Control (n = 42),Pb-infected (n = 42), Tz-infected (n = 42) and Pb- + Tz-infected group (n = 42). Measurement of Pb parasitaemia was done daily throughout the experimental studyperiod for the Pb and the Pb + Tz group. Blood glucose was recorded every thirdday in all experimental groups throughout the experimental study period. Liverand skeletal muscle samples were harvested, snap frozen for determination ofglycogen concentration. Results: Results showed that Tz mono-infection and Tz +Pb co-infection did not have blood glucose lowering effect in the host asexpected. This points to other possible mechanisms through which tissue-dwelling parasites up-regulate the glucose store without decreasing the blood glucoseconcentration as exhibited by the absence of hypoglycaemia in Tz + Pbco-infection group. Hypoinsulinemia and an increase in liver glycogen content wasobserved in Tz mono-infection and Tz + Pb co-infection groups of which thetriggering mechanism remains unclear. Conclusions: To get more insights into how glucose, insulin and glycogen profiles are affected during plasmodium-helminthsco-infections, further studies are recommended where other tissue-dwellinghelminths such as Taenia taeniformis which has strobilocercus as the metacestode in the liver to mimic infections such as hydatid disease in humans are used.

AB  - Mediastinal cancer radiotherapy exposes the heart and causes myocardial injury.It is of utmost importance to identify effective prevention and treatmenttargets. In this study, the regulatory role of adropin (Ad) in radiation-induced myocardial injury (RIMI) was explored in mice. After C57BL/6 mice wereadministered E0771 cells and received radiotherapy, the effects of exogenous Adintervention on myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis, microvessel density, oxidativestress, and protein expression levels were observed. The results showed thatexogenous Ad effectively improved cardiac function, suppressed oxidative stress, inhibited myocardial fibrosis, reduced myocardial apoptosis, and promotedmicroangiogenesis in RIMI mice. Ad also downregulated the expression levels oftransforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), and cleavedcaspase 3 and upregulated the expression of phosphor-endothelial nitric oxidesynthase (p-eNOS). However, the above-mentioned effects of Ad were significantly reversed in Ad(-/-) mice. Radiotherapy resulted in the downregulation ofphosphor-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (p-VEGFR2) and p-Akt inmyocardial tissue, which were upregulated by Ad. However, after targetedinhibition of VEGFR2 with apatinib, the effect of Ad on improving RIMI wassignificantly reversed. Taken together, exogenous Ad significantly amelioratedRIMI by reducing oxidative stress, promoting microangiogenesis, and inhibitingmyocardial fibrosis and apoptosis. The underlying molecular mechanism involvedmay be elucidated by activation of the VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative diseaseafter Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both diseases share common clinical andpathological features: the gradual progression of neurological and psychiatricsymptoms caused by neuronal dysfunction and neuronal cell death due to theaccumulation of misfolded and neurotoxic proteins. Furthermore, both of them are multifactorial diseases in which both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to the disease course. Non-genetic factors are of particular interest for thedevelopment of preventive and therapeutic approaches for these diseases becausethey are modifiable; of these, sleep is a particularly intriguing factor. Sleepdisturbances are highly prevalent among both patients with AD and PD. To date,research has suggested that sleep disturbances are a consequence as well as arisk factor for the onset and progression of AD, which implies a bidirectionalrelationship between sleep and AD. Whether such a relationship exists in PD isless certain, albeit highly plausible given the shared pathomechanisms. Thisreview examines the current evidence for the bidirectional relationship betweensleep and PD. It includes research in both humans and animal models, followed by a discussion of the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying thisrelationship. Finally, potential avenues of research toward achieving diseasemodification to treat or prevent PD are proposed. Although further efforts arecrucial for preventing the onset and slowing the progress of PD, it is evidentthat sleep is a valuable candidate target for future interventions to improve theoutcomes of PD patients.

AB  - Background: Recent research on animal models of ischemic stroke supports the ideathat pharmacological treatment potentially enhancing intrinsic brain plasticitycould modulate acute brain damage, with improved functional recovery. One ofthese new drugs is citicoline, which could provide neurovascular protection andrepair effects. Objectives: The objective of this randomized, single-blindexperimental study was to evaluate whether the treatment with Rischiaril((R))Forte was able to restore intracortical excitability measures, evaluated through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols, in patients with acuteischemic stroke. Methods: Patients with acute ischemic stroke were recruited and assigned to an eight-week therapy of standard treatment (control group - CG) orCDP-choline (Rischiaril((R)) Forte, containing 1,000 mg of citicoline sodiumsalt) added to conventional treatment (treatment group - TG). Each subjectunderwent a clinical evaluation and neurophysiological assessment using TMS,pretretament and posttreatment. Results: A total of thirty participants (mean[SD] age, 68.1 [9.6] years; 11 women [37%]) completed the study. We did notobserve significant changes in clinical scores after CDP-choline treatment (all p> 0.05), but we observed a significant improvement in short-intervalintracortical inhibition (SAI) (p = 0.003) in the TG group compared to the CGgroup. Conclusions: The eight-week treatment with citicoline after acute ischemicstroke may restore intracortical excitability measures, which partially dependson cholinergic transmission. This study extends current knowledge of theapplication of citicoline in acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a leading cause of worldwide agriculturalloss. ASFV is a highly contagious and lethal disease for both domestic and wildpigs, which has brought enormous economic losses to a number of countries.Conventional methods, such as general polymerase chain reaction and isothermalamplification, are time-consuming, instrument-dependent, and unsatisfactorilyaccurate. Therefore, rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable detection of ASFV is important for disease surveillance and control. Herein, we created a one-potvisual detection system for ASFV with CRISPR/Cas12a technology combined with LAMPor RPA. A mineral oil sealing strategy was adopted to mitigate samplecross-contamination between parallel vials during high-throughput testing.Furthermore, the blue fluorescence signal produced by ssDNA reporter could beobserved by the naked eye without any dedicated instrument. For CRISPR-RPAsystem, detection could be completed within 40 min with advantageous sensitivity.While CRISPR-LAMP system could complete it within 60 min with a high sensitivity of 5.8 x 10(2) copies/mul. Furthermore, we verified such detection platformsdisplay no cross-reactivity with other porcine DNA or RNA viruses. BothCRISPR-RPA and CRISPR-LAMP systems permit highly rapid, sensitive, specific, and low-cost Cas12a-mediated visual diagnostic of ASFV for point-of-care testing(POCT) applications.

AB  - Clinical ethics support services (CESS) are employed in healthcare to improvepatient care and help team members develop skills to recognize and navigateethically challenging situations (ECS). The objective of this study was toevaluate the impact of ethics rounds, one form of CESS, on veterinary teammembers. An anonymous, online mixed-methods survey incorporating a 15-iteminstrument designed to assess the outcomes of moral case deliberation originally developed for human healthcare workers (the Euro-MCD 2.0), was developed. Thesurvey was administered to veterinary team members prior to and followingparticipation in a 90-min virtual ethics rounds session. A total of 23 sessionsof virtual ethics rounds were held. In total, 213 individuals participated, and89 completed both surveys (response rate 41.8%). Most respondents were female (n = 70, 81%). Most were veterinarians (n = 51, 59%), followed by other veterinaryteam members (practice manager, animal attendant) (n = 18, 21%), veterinarynurses or animal health technicians (n = 10, 12%) and veterinary students (n = 8,9%). Age ranged from 20 to 73 (median 41, IQR 32-52, n = 87). While there was no statistically significant difference between overall modified Euro-MCD 2.0 scoresbetween T1 and T2, there were statistically significant changes in 7 out of 15Euro-MCD 2.0 items in the domains of moral competence and moral teamwork.Reflexive thematic analysis of free-text responses identified themes includingthe types, impact and barriers to resolving ECS, the impacts of ethics rounds on veterinary team members and constraints preventing veterinary team members fromspeaking up in the face of ECS. While participants largely described the impactof ethics rounds as beneficial (for example, by facilitating clarification ofthinking about ECS, allowing participants to see ECS from the perspective ofothers and providing a safe space for discussion), reflecting on ECS could bestressful for participants. Active participation in ethics rounds may beinhibited in the context of power imbalance, or in settings where bullyingoccurs. Overall, carefully facilitated ethics rounds has the potential to improvethe ability of veterinary team members to identify and navigate ECS, andpotentially mitigate moral distress.

AB  - Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of cells that are present in allvertebrate tissues. They play a key role in the innate immune system, and thus,in vitro cultures of macrophages provide a valuable model for exploring theirtissue-specific functions and interactions with pathogens. Porcine macrophagecultures are often used for the identification and characterization of porcineviral pathogens. Recently, we have developed a simple and efficient method forisolating primary macrophages from the kidneys and livers of swine. Here, weapplied this protocol to fetal porcine intestinal tissues and demonstrated thatporcine intestinal macrophages (PIM) can be isolated from mixed primary cultures of porcine small intestine-derived cells. Since the proliferative capacity ofprimary PIM is limited, we attempted to immortalize them by transferring the SV40large T antigen and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase genes usinglentiviral vectors. Consequently, immortalized PIM (IPIM) were successfullygenerated and confirmed to retain various features of primary PIM. We furtherrevealed that IPIM are susceptible to infection by the African swine fever virus and the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and support theirreplication. These findings suggest that the IPIM cell line is a useful tool for developing in vitro models that mimic the intestinal mucosal microenvironments ofswine, and for studying the interactions between porcine pathogens and hostimmune cells.

AB  - Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by Brucella spp. which can lead toheavy economic losses and severe human diseases. Thus, controlling brucellosis isvery important. Due to humans easily gaining brucellosis from animals, animalbrucellosis control programs can help the eradication of human brucellosis. Thereare two popular vaccines against animal brucellosis. Live attenuated Brucellaabortus strain 19 (S19 vaccine) is the first effective and most extensively used vaccine for the prevention of brucellosis in cattle. Live attenuated Brucellamelitensis strain Rev.1 (Rev.1 vaccine) is the most effective vaccine againstcaprine and ovine brucellosis. Although these two vaccines provide good immunity for animals against brucellosis, the expense of persistent serological responses is one of the main problems of both vaccines. The advantages and limitations ofBrucella vaccines, especially new vaccine candidates, have been less studied. In addition, there is an urgent need for new strategies to control and eradicatethis disease. Therefore, this narrative review aims to present an updatedoverview of the available different types of brucellosis vaccines.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of non-starchpolysaccharide (NSP) enzymes and protease combination on growth performance, meatquality, and nutrients digestibility of yellow-feathered broilers fed withcorn-soybean meal basal diets with normal and subnormal crude protein (CP)levels. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments, including six replicates of 20 birds per pen. Twobasal diets were formulated with normal CP level as positive control (PC) andsubnormal CP level without extra essential amino acid (AA) supplementation asnegative control (NC). The basal diets were supplemented without or with NSPenzymes and protease. Broilers fed with the NC diet had lower (P < 0.05) finalbody weight (BW), average daily weight gain (ADG) on days 1-21, 22-56 and 1-56and higher (P < 0.05) feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) on day 22-56 than those fed withPC diet. The broilers fed with the NC diet had higher (P < 0.05) L(*) and b(*)values in thigh muscle, crypt depth in the duodenum, and dry matter (DM)digestibility as well as lower (P < 0.05) villus height, musculature thicknesses,and villus height: crypt depth in the duodenum than those fed with the PC diet.Dietary NSP enzymes and protease combination increased (P < 0.05) the ADG and F/Gof the broilers on days 1-56, and pH values in breast and thigh muscles as wellas the digestibility of DM, gross energy (GE), CP and most AAs of the broilers onday 56. Compared with the PC diet, the combination of NSP enzymes and proteaseexhibited greater (P < 0.05) improvements in the digestibility of DM, CP, andsome AAs (Asp, Ile, and Leu) in the broilers fed with the NC diet. In conclusion,reducing CP diet without essential AA supplementation impaired the growthperformance and meat color of the thigh muscles of the broilers. The combination of NSP enzymes and protease effectively improved the growth performance, meatquality, and nutritional values of the broilers. In terms of the digestibility ofDM, CP, and some AAs, the magnitude of response to the addition of NSP enzymesand protease was greater in the low nutritional-quality diet with a subnormal CP level.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to determine the optimum dietary metabolicenergy (ME) and crude protein (CP) levels of growing male mink. One hundredforty-four healthy male minks at 75 days were randomly allocated into the sixgroups with 24 replicates, which was one mink for each replicate. The mink werefed six experimental diets with two CP levels (31.59 and 35.63%) and three MElevels (14.17, 15.96, and 17.73 MJ/kg) for a 7-day preliminary period and thenfor an 88-day experimental period. The final body weight (BW), average daily gain(ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), fat digestibility, energy intake, theconcentration of glucose (GLU), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of the minkwere significantly increased by the CP or ME levels (P < 0.05). In addition, CPlevels significantly (P < 0.01) increased the N intake and N retention. DietaryME levels increased the utilization of gross energy. Obviously, there weresignificant CP x ME interactions for the final BW, ADG, fat digestibility, energyutilization, GLU, LDL (P < 0.01), and triglyceride contents (P < 0.05).Therefore, the optimum CP and ME levels were 35.97% and 18.18 MJ/kg, which canimprove growth, enhance nutrient digestion, and promote blood lipid metabolism ingrowing mink.

PG  - 876898
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.876898 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis remains a very challenging condition; recent clinical studies have shown infection control rates following surgery/antibioticsto be ~60%. Additionally, prior efforts to produce an effective S. aureus vaccinehave failed, in part due to lack of knowledge of protective immunity. Previously,we demonstrated that anti-glucosaminidase (Gmd) antibodies are protective inanimal models but found that only 6.7% of culture-confirmed S. aureusosteomyelitis patients in the AO Clinical Priority Program (AO-CPP) Registry had basal serum levels (>10 ng/ml) of anti-Gmd at the time of surgery (baseline). We identified a small subset of patients with high levels of anti-Gmd antibodies andadverse outcomes following surgery, not explained by Ig class switching tonon-functional isotypes. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that clinical curefollowing surgery is associated with anti-Gmd neutralizing antibodies in serum.Therefore, we first optimized an in vitro assay that quantifies recombinant Gmdlysis of the M. luteus cell wall and used it to demonstrate the 50% neutralizing concentration (NC50) of a humanized anti-Gmd mAb (TPH-101) to be ~15.6 mug/ml. Wealso demonstrated that human serum deficient in anti-Gmd antibodies can becomplemented by TPH-101 to achieve the same dose-dependent Gmd neutralizingactivity as purified TPH-101. Finally, we assessed the anti-Gmd physical titerand neutralizing activity in sera from 11 patients in the AO-CPP Registry, whowere characterized into four groups post-hoc. Group 1 patients (n=3) had highanti-Gmd physical and neutralizing titers at baseline that decreased withclinical cure of the infection over time. Group 2 patients (n=3) had undetectableanti-Gmd antibodies throughout the study and adverse outcomes. Group 3 (n=3) had high titers +/- neutralizing anti-Gmd at baseline with adverse outcomes. Group 4 (n=2) had low titers of non-neutralizing anti-Gmd at baseline with delayed hightiters and adverse outcomes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that bothneutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-Gmd antibodies exist in S. aureusosteomyelitis patients and that screening for these antibodies could have a valuefor identifying patients in need of passive immunization prior to surgery. Futureprospective studies to test the prognostic value of anti-Gmd antibodies to assessthe potential of passive immunization with TPH-101 are warranted.

AB  - Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp.Because rodents are natural hosts of Leptospira, rodent models of pathogenesishave been limited, but are valuable to understand infection in reservoir animals even in the absence of disease. Mouse models of infection provide advantages due to genetic tractability, so developing murine models of Leptospira infection iscrucial for further understanding the biology of this organism. Previously ourlaboratory developed a short-term murine model of Borrelia burgdorferihematogenous dissemination to investigate the role of adhesion proteins onbacterial survival and dissemination within a host. Here we adapt this model toLeptospira. C3H/HeJ mice are anesthetized, inoculated intravenously, and thenbacteria are allowed to circulate for up to twenty-four hours. Mice areeuthanized, perfused with saline, and tissues are harvested for culture and DNApurification. Bacterial burdens are determined by quantitative PCR. Reproducible burdens of bacteria were found in tissues upon inoculation with pathogens andnon-pathogens, demonstrating the utility of this model to probe differentLeptospira species and strains. Pathogenic L. interrogans has a significantlyhigher burden in blood, liver, kidney, and bladder at one-hour post-inoculationwhen compared to non-pathogenic L. biflexa. Colonization of the kidney isessential to the life cycle of pathogenic Leptospira in nature. Measurableburdens of non-pathogenic L. biflexa were found in numerous organs and liveleptospires were recovered from blood samples for at least three hourspost-inoculation, contrary to the previous belief that non-pathogenic leptospiresare rapidly cleared. This short-term murine model of Leptospira hematogenousdissemination will allow for the interrogation of virulence factors potentiallyimportant for tissue colonization and evasion of host defenses, and represents a novel animal model for investigating determinants of Leptospira infection.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a constant threat to human beings and the world economy for more than two years. Vaccination is the first choice tocontrol and prevent the pandemic. However, an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccineagainst the virus infection is still needed. This study designed and preparedfour kinds of virus-like particles (VLPs) using an insect expression system. Two constructs encoded wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) fused with or without H5N1matrix 1 (M1) (S and SM). The other two constructs contained a codon-optimizedspike gene and/or M1 gene (mS and mSM) based on protein expression, stability,and ADE avoidance. The results showed that the VLP-based vaccine could inducehigh SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in mice, including specific IgG, IgG1, andIgG2a. Moreover, the mSM group has the most robust ability to stimulate humoralimmunity and cellular immunity than the other VLPs, suggesting the mSM is thebest immunogen. Further studies showed that the mSM combined with Al/CpG adjuvantcould stimulate animals to produce sustained high-level antibodies and establish an effective protective barrier to protect mice from challenges withmouse-adapted strain. The vaccine based on mSM and Al/CpG adjuvant is a promisingcandidate vaccine to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Members of the WD40-repeat protein family can be found in all eukaryoticproteomes where they usually serve as interaction platforms for the assembly oflarge protein complexes and are therefore essential for the integrity of thesecomplexes. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the WD40-repeat proteinPfWLP1 has been shown to interact with members of distinct adhesion proteincomplexes in the asexual blood stages and gametocyte stages. In this study, wedemonstrate that the presence of PfWLP1 is crucial for both the stability ofthese gametocyte-specific adhesion complexes as well as for gametocyte maturationand gametogenesis. Using reverse genetics, we generated a PfWLP1-knockdownparasite line for functional characterization of the protein. Knockdown of PfWLP1resulted in a slight reduction of gametocyte numbers and significantly theimpaired ability of the gametocytes to exflagellate. PfWLP1-knockdown further ledto reduced protein levels of the Limulus coagulation factor C-like (LCCL)-domain proteins PfCCp1 and PfCCp2, which are key components of the adhesion complexes.These findings suggest that the interaction of PfWLP1 with members of thePfCCp-based adhesion complex ensures complex stability and thereby contributes togametocyte viability and exflagellation.

TI  - Dogs and the Good Life: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Association Between theDog-Owner Relationship and Owner Mental Wellbeing.
PG  - 903647
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903647 [doi]
AB  - Dog ownership is believed to benefit owner wellbeing but, contrary to popularbelief, there is limited evidence to suggest that simply owning a dog isassociated with improved mental health. This mixed-methods study investigateswhether dog owners with stronger relationships with their dogs experience better mental health. Participants (n = 1,693, adult United Kingdom dog owners)completed an online survey. Owners' health was measured using the validatedPROMIS questions regarding depression, anxiety, emotional support, andcompanionship. The dog-owner relationship was measured using the validated MDORS scale, which has three subscales: interaction, emotional closeness, and perceivedcosts. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted,adjusting for confounding factors. Additionally, positive and negative impacts ofdog ownership on mental wellbeing were coded from open questions using thematicanalysis. A stronger dog-owner relationship was associated with greater feelings of emotional support and companionship but poorer mental health in terms ofanxiety or depression. However, the perceived costs (burden) subscale wasconsistently associated with better mental health outcomes. Direction ofcausality cannot be inferred as people with poor mental health may acquire dogsto help relieve symptoms, which qualitative analysis supported. Key themesincluded positive impacts on owner wellbeing and happiness through providingpurpose, companionship and self-acceptance, pleasure and distraction, as well as lessening emotional pain and suffering and reducing risk behaviors. However,negative impacts of a strong relationship include anticipatory grief over loss ofthe dog, and concerns regarding the burden of responsibility and ability to meet dog's needs. Perceived ability to adequately meet dog's needs promoted personalgrowth and positive relationships with others, whereas perceived inability led tofeelings of guilt, or anger/frustration, and reduced autonomy and sense ofenvironmental mastery. Dog ownership contributes to both hedonic and eudaimonicwellbeing in multiple ways, including supporting owners through periods of poormental health and providing purpose. However, the burden of responsibility andowner and dog characteristics can create challenges, and owners may benefit from support in caring for their dogs and reducing problematic behaviors.

AB  - Puruna is a composite beef cattle breed, developed in Southern Brazil by crossingthe Angus, Charolais, Canchim, and Caracu breeds. The goal of this study was toperform the first genetic characterization of the Puruna breed, based on bothpedigree and genomic information. For this, 100 randomly selected animals weregenotyped, and 11,205 animals born from 1997 to 2019 had pedigree information.The genetic analyses performed were principal component analysis, admixture,phylogenic tree, pedigree and genomic inbreeding, linkage disequilibrium (LD),effective population size (Ne), consistency of the gametic phase, runs ofhomozygosity (ROH), heterozygosity-enriched regions (HERs), and functionalanalyses of the ROH and HER regions identified. Our findings indicate that Purunais more genetically related to the Charolais, Canchim, and Angus breeds thanCaracu or Nellore. The levels of inbreeding were shown to be small based on allthe metrics evaluated and ranged from -0.009 to 0.029. A low (-0.12-0.31)correlation of the pedigree-based inbreeding compared to all the genomicinbreeding coefficients evaluated was observed. The LD average was 0.031(+/-0.0517), and the consistency of the gametic phase was shown to be low for allthe breed pairs, ranging from 0.42 to 0.27 to the distance of 20 Mb. The Nevalues based on pedigree and genomic information were 158 and 115, respectively. A total of 1,839 ROHs were found, and the majority of them are of small length(<4 Mb). An important homozygous region was identified on BTA5 with pathwaysrelated to behavioral traits (sensory perception, detection of stimulus, andothers), as well as candidate genes related to heat tolerance (MY O 1A), feedconversion rate (RDH5), and reproduction (AMDHD1). A total of 1,799 HERs wereidentified in the Puruna breed with 92.3% of them classified within the 0.5-1 Mb length group, and 19 HER islands were identified in the autosomal genome. TheseHER islands harbor genes involved in growth pathways, carcass weight (SDCBP),meat and carcass quality (MT2A), and marbling deposition (CISH). Despite thegenetic relationship between Puruna and the founder breeds, a multi-breed genomicevaluation is likely not feasible due to their population structure and lowconsistency of the gametic phase among them.

PG  - 898853
LID - 10.3389/fragi.2022.898853 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dementia is a global challenge with 10 million individuals beingdiagnosed every year. Currently, there are no established disease-modifyingtreatments for dementia. Impaired nutrient sensing has been implicated in thepathogenesis of dementia. Compounds that inhibit the glycogen synthase kinase-3(GSK3) pathway have been investigated as a possible treatment to attenuate theprogression of the disease, particularly the suppression of thehyper-phosphorylation process of the tau protein. Aims: Systematicallysummarizing compounds which have been tested to inhibit the GSK3 pathway to treatcognitive impairment and dementia. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Sciencedatabases were searched from inception until 28 July 2021 for articles published in English. Interventional animal studies inhibiting the GSK3 pathway inAlzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's dementia, Lewy body dementia, vasculardementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal cognitive ageinginvestigating the change in cognition as the outcome were included. TheSystematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation's risk of biastool for animal studies was applied. Results: Out of 4,154 articles, 29 describedcompounds inhibiting the GSK3 pathway. All studies were based on animal models ofMCI, AD or normal cognitive ageing. Thirteen out of 21 natural compounds and fiveout of nine synthetic compounds tested in MCI and dementia animal models showedan overall positive effect on cognition. No articles reported human studies. The risk of bias was largely unclear. Conclusion: Novel therapeutics involved in the modulation of the GSK3 nutrient sensing pathway have the potential to improvecognitive function. Overall, there is a clear lack of translation from animalmodels to humans.

TI  - A systems analysis of irrigation water quality in an environmental assessment of an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak in the United States linked to iceberg lettuce.
PG  - 11-118

AB  - A foodborne Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak in December 2006 included 77illnesses reported in Iowa and Minnesota. Epidemiologic investigations by health departments in those states and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) identified shredded iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) as thevehicle of transmission. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) andMinnesota and California public health agencies traced the lettuce to severalgrowing regions in California based on information from a lettuce processor inMinnesota. Samples from an environmental investigation initiated by theCalifornia Food Emergency Response Team (CalFERT) revealed a genetic matchbetween the outbreak strain and environmental samples from a single farm, leadingto an in-depth systems-based analysis of the irrigation water system on thatfarm. This paper presents findings from that systems-based analysis, whichassessed conditions on the farm potentially contributing to contamination of the lettuce. The farm had three sources of irrigation water: groundwater from onsite wells, surface water delivered by a water management agency and effluent fromwastewater lagoons on nearby dairy farms. Wastewater effluent was blended withthe other sources and used only to irrigate animal feed crops. However, watermanagement on the farm, including control of wastewater blending, appeared tocreate potential for cross-contamination. Pressure gradients and lack of backflowmeasures in the irrigation system might have created conditions forcross-contamination of water used to irrigate lettuce. The irrigation network on the farm had evolved over time to meet various needs, without an overall analysisof how that evolution potentially created vulnerabilities to contamination ofirrigation water. The type of systems analysis described here is one method forhelping to ensure that such vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. Apreventive, risk-based management approach, such as the Water Safety Plan processfor drinking water, may also be useful in managing irrigation water quality.

TI  - The Changes in Microbiotic Composition of Different Intestinal Tracts and theEffects of Supplemented Lactobacillus During the Formation of Goose Fatty Liver.
PG  - 906895
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.906895 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal bacteria play an important role in the formation of fatty liver inanimals by participating in the digestion and degradation of nutrients, producingvarious metabolites, and altering the barrier effect of the intestine. However,changes in the gut microbiota during the formation of goose fatty liver areunclear. In this study, 80 healthy Landes geese with similar body weights at 70days of age were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 48; fedad libitum) and the overfeeding group (n = 32; overfed). The intestinal contents were collected at 0, 12, and 24 days of overfeeding. The 16S rRNA and metagenomicsequencing analyses showed that the dominant phyla were Firmicutes,Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. At the genus level,Phyllobacterium, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, andRomboutsia were the dominant genera in the goose intestine, and most of them wereprobiotics. In the control group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in thejejunum and ileum gradually decreased with time, while that of Proteobacteriaincreased, whereas in the overfeeding group, the relative abundance of Firmicutesin the jejunum and ileum decreased and then increased with time, while that ofProteobacteria showed an opposite trend. In addition, supplementing Lactobacillusto the diet reduced body weight and fatty liver weight in overfed geese, butincreased the weight of abdominal fat, suggesting that Lactobacillussupplementation might affect the transport of nascent fat from the liver toabdominal fat. In conclusion, the species of intestinal-dominant bacteria in the geese are relatively stable, but their relative abundance and function areaffected by a number of factors. Overfeeding promotes the metabolism of nutrientsin the jejunum and ileum and increases bacterial adaptability to environmentalchanges by enhancing their ability to process environmental and geneticinformation more efficiently. These findings suggest that the effect ofoverfeeding on the composition of intestinal microbiota may indirectly influence the formation of goose fatty liver through the gut/liver axis.

PG  - 925866
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.925866 [doi]
AB  - In response to the increasing nosocomial infections caused byantimicrobial-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), bacteriophages(phages) have emerged as an alternative to antibiotics. Staphylococcusureilyticus, one of the representative species of the CoNS, is now considered anotable pathogen that causes nosocomial bloodstream infections, and itsbiofilm-forming ability increases pathogenicity and resistance to antimicrobialagents. In this study, a lytic phage infecting S. ureilyticus was newly isolated from wastewater collected from a sewage treatment plant and its biological andantimicrobial characteristics are described. The isolated phage, namedvB_SurP-PSU3, was morphologically similar to Podoviridae and could simultaneouslylyse some S. warneri strains used in this study. The sequenced genome of thephage consisted of linear dsDNA with 18,146 bp and genome-based phylogenyrevealed that vB_SurP-PSU3 belonged to the genus Andhravirus. Although itsoverall genomic arrangement and contents were similar to those of other membersof the Andhravirus, the predicted endolysin of vB_SurP-PSU3 distinctly differedfrom the other members of the genus. The bacteriolytic activity of vB_SurP-PSU3was evaluated using S. ureilyticus ATCC 49330, and the phage could efficientlyinhibit the planktonic growth of the bacteria. Moreover, the anti-biofilmanalysis showed that vB_SurP-PSU3 could prevent the formation of bacterialbiofilm and degrade the mature biofilm in vitro. In an additional cytotoxicityassay of vB_SurP-PSU3, no significant adverse effects were observed on the testedcell. Based on these findings, the newly isolated phage vB_SurP-PSU3 could beclassified as a new member of Andhravirus and could be considered an alternative potential biocontrol agent against S. ureilyticus infections and its biofilm.

PG  - 940158

AB  - Rumen fluid transplantation (RFT) has been used to rebuild rumen bacterialhomeostasis, reshape rumen function, and restore rumen fermentation, whereas the effect of RFT on fecal microbiota and host metabolism in cows remains poorlyunderstood. In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA sequencing and serumnon-targeted metabolomics was performed to investigate the response of fecalmicrobiota and serum metabolome in dairy cows following RFT. Twenty-fourprepartum dairy cows were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n = 8) for infusion ofeither saline (Con), fresh rumen fluid (FR), or sterilized rumen fluid (SR) aftercalving. Fourteen days after calving, fecal microbiota and serum metabolome were analyzed. The sequencing data of fecal samples revealed no changes in alphadiversity and relative abundance of dominant genera such as RuminococcaceaeUCG-005, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes. However, theother genus level taxa, such as Eubacterium oxidoreducens, Anaerorhabdus furcosa,Bacillus and Selenomonas, showed distinct changes following RFT. Serum metabolomeanalysis showed that FR or SR infusion affected amino acids metabolism, bileacids metabolism and fatty acids metabolism (including linoleic acid, oleic acid and palmitic acid). Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that taxa fromgenera Clostridiales were positively correlated with metabolites involved intryptophan and bile acid metabolisms, such as OTU1039 from genera unclassifiedo_Clostridiales was positively correlated to indoleacetic acid andtaurolithocholic acid. These results suggest that RFT altered the composition of the fecal microbiota and modulated microbial metabolic pathways, which is vitalfor the development and safety assessment of rumen microbial interventionstrategies.

PG  - 949002
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.949002 [doi]
AB  - It was acknowledged long ago that microorganisms have played critical roles inanimal evolution. Tibetan wild asses (TWA, Equus kiang) are the only wildperissodactyls on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and the first nationalprotected animals; however, knowledge about the relationships between their gutmicrobiota and the host's adaptability remains poorly understood. Herein, 16SrRNA and meta-genomic sequencing approaches were employed to investigate the gut microbiota-host associations in TWA and were compared against those of theco-resident livestock of yak (Bos grunnies) and Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries).Results revealed that the gut microbiota of yak and Tibetan sheep underwentconvergent evolution. By contrast, the intestinal microflora of TWA diverged in adirection enabling the host to subsist on sparse and low-quality forage.Meanwhile, high microbial diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices), cellulolyticactivity, and abundant indicator species such as Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes,Prevotella_1, and Treponema_2 supported forage digestion and short-chain fattyacid production in the gut of TWA. Meanwhile, the enterotype identificationanalysis showed that TWA shifted their enterotype in response to low-qualityforage for a better utilization of forage nitrogen and short-chain fatty acidproduction. Metagenomic analysis revealed that plant biomass degrading microbial consortia, genes, and enzymes like the cellulolytic strains (Prevotellaruminicola, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, Butyrivibriofibrisolvens, and Ruminobacter amylophilus), as well as carbohydrate metabolismgenes (GH43, GH3, GH31, GH5, and GH10) and enzymes (beta-glucosidase, xylanase,and beta-xylosidase, etc.) had a significantly higher enrichment in TWA. Ourresults indicate that gut microbiota can improve the adaptability of TWA through plant biomass degradation and energy maintenance by the functions of gutmicrobiota in the face of nutritional deficiencies and also provide a strongrationale for understanding the roles of gut microbiota in the adaptation of QTP wildlife when facing harsh feeding environments.

AB  - The microbiome of tardigrades, a phylum of microscopic animals best known fortheir ability to survive extreme conditions, is poorly studied worldwide andcompletely unknown in North America. An improved understanding oftardigrade-associated bacteria is particularly important because tardigrades havebeen shown to act as vectors of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris in the laboratory. However, the potential role of tardigrades as reservoirs and vectors of phytopathogens has not been investigated further. This study analyzed themicrobiota of tardigrades from six apple orchards in central Iowa, United States,and is the first analysis of the microbiota of North American tardigrades. It is also the first ever study of the tardigrade microbiome in an agriculturalsetting. We utilized 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize thetardigrade community microbiome across four contrasts: location, substrate type(moss or lichen), collection year, and tardigrades vs. their substrate. Alphadiversity of the tardigrade community microbiome differed significantly bylocation and year of collection but not by substrate type. Our work alsocorroborated earlier findings, demonstrating that tardigrades harbor a distinctmicrobiota from their environment. We also identified tardigrade-associated taxa that belong to genera known to contain phytopathogens (Pseudomonas, Ralstonia,and the Pantoea/Erwinia complex). Finally, we observed members of the generaRickettsia and Wolbachia in the tardigrade microbiome; because these are obligateintracellular genera, we consider these taxa to be putative endosymbionts oftardigrades. These results suggest the presence of putative endosymbionts andphytopathogens in the microbiota of wild tardigrades in North America.

AB  - The increasing use of metal oxide-based nanoparticles (MNPs) and their releaseinto the environment cast concerns about their environmental impacts. Massiveefforts have been focused on environmental behaviours and ecotoxicities to figureout the potential threats posed by MNPs. This review systematically summarisesand re-analyses published data about the MNP interactions and transformationprocesses in freshwater and the toxicological effects of MNPs on invertebrates. Acase study was conducted through meta-analysis to examine the impacts of silvernanoparticle exposure to freshwater invertebrates. The conclusions categorizedthe current understanding of the outcome and ecotoxicity of MNPs in freshwater.The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is recommended for environmental riskassessment as it provides a rapid and accurate risk assessment of an increasingnumber of novel compounds consuming fewer resources and animal tests.Invertebrates contribute significantly towards developing robust AOPs thanks to ashorter life cycle, allowing chronic and complete life cycle toxicity tests.

AB  - In this research, a series of 3-(pyridine-3-yl)-2-oxazolidinone derivatives wasdesigned, synthesized, and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity, whichincluded bacteriostatic, morphological, kinetic studies, and molecular docking.The results demonstrated that compounds 21b, 21d, 21e and 21f exhibited strongantibacterial activity similar to that of linezolid toward five Gram-positivebacteria. After observing the effect of the drug on the morphology and growthdynamics of the bacteria, the possible modes of action were predicted bymolecular docking. Furthermore, the antibiofilm activity and the potential drugresistance assay was proceeded. These compounds exhibited universal antibiofilmactivity and compound 21d showed significant concentration-dependent inhibitionof biofilm formation. Compound 21d also showed a stable effect on S. pneumoniae(ATCC 49619) with less drug resistance growth for 15 days, which is much longerthan that of linezolid. Overall, these results can be used to guide furtherexploration of novel antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Coprophagy is an instinctive behavior in rabbit with important effects on growth and reproductive performance. The underlying mechanism of this effect in rabbitis unknown. Here, we used Elizabeth circle as a coprophagy preventing model infemale rabbits and assess feed intake, growth, and reproductive performance. Wefound that preventing coprophagy did not affect feed intake but decreased bodyweight and weight of several organs and tissues and resulted in completereproductive failure during the late pregnancy period, accompanied by reducedlevels of plasma progesterone. RNA-seq analysis of rabbit ovarian tissuesrevealed that preventing coprophagy affected significantly 241 genes (DEGs), withthe large majority being downregulated. Bioinformatic analyses revealed thatthose DEGs are mostly involved in apoptosis, immune response, and metabolicpathways. Among DEGs, the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) wassignificantly downregulated in the coprophagy prevention group. Further studiesusing siRNA and adenovirus overexpression systems revealed that CTSB promotes theproliferation of rabbit granulosa cells (GCS) and prevents apoptosis. Measurementof transcripts coding for proteins related to apoptosis revealed a minortranscriptomic effect of CTSB, indicating that its effect is likelypost-transcriptional. Overexpression of CTSB increased secretion of progesterone and estradiol, partly via upregulation of CYP19A1 while inhibition of CTSBdecreased progesterone secretion partly via downregulation of the StAR gene. Inconclusion, our study demonstrated the detrimental effect on reproduction bypreventing coprophagy with a main role for this response played by CTSB on thegranulosa cells of the ovary.

AB  - Mice have become increasingly popular as genetic tools, facilitated by theproduction of advanced genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). GEMMs oftenrequire in-house breeding and production by research groups, which can be quitecomplex depending on the design of the GEMM. Identification of methods toincrease the efficiency of breeding practices offers opportunities to optimizeand reduce the number of animals bred for research while maintaining similarresearch output. We investigated the use of commercial automated genotyping andcentralized breeding management on overall breeding colony productivity in acolony of multiple GEMM lines. This study involved a three-group study design,where the first group continued their standard breeding practices (group A), the second utilized standard breeding practices but outsourced genotyping in place ofinhouse genotyping (group B), and a third group outsourced genotyping and hadassistance with routine breeding practices from the laboratory animal care team(group C). Compared to standard practice (group A), groups B and C produced more cages and mice over time, which appeared to be driven primarily by an increase inthe number of breeding cages in each colony. Higher numbers of breederscorrelated with an increased number of litters and generation of new cages. Theincreases in colony productivity measures were further enhanced in group Ccompared to group B. The overall cost associated with producing new animals waslowest in group B, followed by groups A and C. Although, by the end of the study,cost to produce new mice was comparable between all three groups. These datasuggest that by optimizing breeding practices and management, fewer animals couldbe utilized to produce the same amount of progeny and reduce overall animal usageand production.

AB  - As the largest internal organ, the liver is the key hub for many physiologicalprocesses. Previous research on the liver has been mainly conducted on animalmodels and cell lines, in which not only there are deficiencies in speciesvariability and retention of heritable material, but it is also difficult forprimary hepatocytes to maintain their metabolic functions after in vitroexpansion. Because of the increased burden of liver disease worldwide, there is agrowing demand for 3D in vitro liver models-Liver Organoids. Based on the type ofinitiation cells, the liver organoid can be classified as PSC-derived orASC-derived. Liver organoids originated from ASC or primary sclerosingcholangitis, which are co-cultured in matrix gel with components such as stromal cells or immune cells, and eventually form three-dimensional structures in thepresence of cytokines. Liver organoids have already made progress in drugscreening, individual medicine and disease modeling with hereditary liverdiseases, alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver diseases and primary liver cancer. In this review, we summarize the generation process of liver organoids and thecurrent clinical applications, including disease modeling, drug screening andindividual medical treatment, which provide new perspectives for liver physiologyand disease research.

LID - 10.1093/biosci/biac039 [doi]
AB  - Odor is everywhere, emitted across the landscape from predators, prey, decayingcarcasses, conspecifics, vegetation, surface water, and smoke. Many animalsexploit odor to find food, avoid threats, and attract or judge potential mates.Here, we focus on odor in terrestrial ecosystems to introduce the concept of anolfactory landscape: real-time dynamic olfactory contours reflecting the patchydistribution of resources and risks, providing a key source of information usedby many animals in their movement and decision-making. Incorporating theolfactory landscape into current frameworks of movement ecology and animalbehavior will provide a mechanistic link to help answer significant questionsabout where, why, and when many animals move, and how they do so efficiently inboth space and time. By understanding how animals use the olfactory landscape to make crucial decisions affecting their fitness, we can then manipulate thelandscape to modify ecological interactions and, ultimately, ecosystemconsequences of these interactions.

TI  - Rats with high aerobic capacity display enhanced transcriptional adaptability andupregulation of bile acid metabolism in response to an acute high-fat diet.
PG  - e15405
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15405 [doi]
AB  - Rats selectively bred for the high intrinsic aerobic capacity runner (HCR) or lowaerobic capacity runner (LCR) show pronounced differences in susceptibility forhigh-fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulinresistance, replicating the protective effect of high aerobic capacity in humans.We have previously shown multiple systemic differences in energy and substratemetabolism that impacts steatosis between HCR and LCR rats. This study aimed toinvestigate hepatic-specific mechanisms of action via changes in genetranscription. Livers of HCR rats had a greater number of genes thatsignificantly changed in response to 3-day HFHS compared with LCR rats (171 vs.75 genes: >1.5-fold, p < 0.05). HCR and LCR rats displayed numerous baselinedifferences in gene expression while on a low-fat control diet (CON). A 3-dayHFHS diet resulted in greater expression of genes involved in the conversion ofexcess acetyl-CoA to cholesterol and bile acid (BA) synthesis compared with theCON diet in HCR, but not LCR rats. These results were associated with higherfecal BA loss and lower serum BA concentrations in HCR rats. Exercise studies in rats and mice also revealed higher hepatic expression of cholesterol and BAsynthesis genes. Overall, these results suggest that high aerobic capacity andexercise are associated with upregulated BA synthesis paired with greater fecalexcretion of cholesterol and BA, an effect that may play a role in protectionagainst hepatic steatosis in rodents.

TI  - Ultrasound biomicroscopy for the assessment of early-stage nonalcoholic fattyliver disease induced in rats by a high-fat diet.
LID - 10.14366/usg.21182 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of ultrasoundbiomicroscopy (UBM) to diagnose the initial stages of nonalcoholic fatty liverdisease (NAFLD) in a rat model. METHODS: Eighteen male Wistar rats were allocatedto control or experimental groups. A high-fat diet (HFD) with 20% fructose and 2%cholesterol, resembling a common Western diet, was fed to animals in theexperimental groups for up to 16 weeks; those in the control group received aregular diet. A 21 MHz UBM system was used to acquire B-mode images at specifictimes: baseline (T0), 10 weeks (T10), and 16 weeks (T16). The sonographichepatorenal index (SHRI), based on the average ultrasound image gray-levelintensities from the liver parenchyma and right renal cortex, was determined atT0, T10, and T16. The liver specimen histology was classified using the modified Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network NAFLD activity scoringsystem. RESULTS: The livers in the animals in the experimental groups progressed from sinusoidal congestion and moderate macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis tomoderate steatosis and frequent hepatocyte ballooning. The SHRI obtained in theexperimental group animals at T10 and T16 was significantly different from theSHRI of pooled control group. No significant difference existed between the SHRI in animals receiving HFD between T10 and T16. CONCLUSION: SHRI measurement using UBM may be a promising noninvasive tool to characterize early-stage NAFLD in rat models.

TI  - Mouse model of NASH that replicates key features of the human disease andprogresses to fibrosis stage 3.
LID - 10.1002/hep4.2035 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the United States and the world; with no Food and Drug Administration-approvedpharmacological treatment available, it remains an area of unmet medical need. Innonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most important predictor of clinicaloutcome is the fibrosis stage. Moreover, the Food and Drug Administrationrecommends that clinical trials for drugs to treat this disease include patients with fibrosis stage 2 or greater. Therefore, when using animal models forinvestigating the pathophysiology of NAFLD and for the preclinical evaluation of new drugs, it is important that the animals develop substantial fibrosis. The aimof this study was to develop a mouse model of NAFLD that replicated the diseasein humans, including obesity and progressive liver fibrosis. Agouti yellow mutantmice, which have hyperphagia, were fed a Western diet and water containinghigh-fructose corn syrup for 16 weeks. Mice became obese and developed glucoseintolerance. Their gut microbiota showed dysbiosis with changes that replicatesome of the changes described in humans with NASH. They developed NASH withactivity scores of 5-6 and fibrosis, which was stage 1 after 16 weeks, and stage 3 after 12 months. Changes in liver gene expression assessed by gene-setenrichment analysis showed 90% similarity with changes in human patients withNASH. Conclusion: Ay mice, when fed a Western diet similar to that consumed byhumans, develop obesity and NASH with liver histology, including fibrosis, andgene expression changes that are highly similar to the disease in humans.

TI  - Modeling propofol-induced cardiotoxicity in the isolated-perfused newborn mouseheart.
PG  - e15402
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15402 [doi]
AB  - Infants and children are vulnerable to developing propofol infusion syndrome(PRIS) and young age is a risk factor. Cardiac involvement is often prominent andassociated with death. However, the mechanisms of pediatric PRIS are poorlyunderstood because of the paucity of investigation and lack of a gold standardanimal model. Unfortunately, in vivo modeling of PRIS in a newborn mouse is notfeasible and would be complicated by confounders. Thus, we focused onpropofol-induced cardiotoxicity and aimed to develop an ex-vivo model in theisolated-perfused newborn mouse heart. We hypothesized that the model wouldrecapitulate the key cardiac features of PRIS seen in infants and children andwould corroborate prior in vitro observations. Isolated perfused newborn mousehearts were exposed to a toxic dose of propofol or intralipid for 30-min. Surfaceelectrocardiogram, ventricular contractile force, and oxygen extraction weremeasured over time. Real-time multiphoton laser imaging was utilized to quantify calcein and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester fluorescence. Propidium iodideuptake was assessed following drug exposure. A toxic dose of propofol rapidlyinduced dysrhythmias, depressed ventricular contractile function, impaired themitochondrial membrane potential, and increased open probability of thepermeability transition pore in propofol-exposed hearts without causing celldeath. These features mimicked the hallmarks of pediatric PRIS and corroboratedprior observations made in isolated newborn cardiomyocyte mitochondria. Thus,acute propofol-induced cardiotoxicity in the isolated-perfused developing mouseheart may serve as a relevant ex-vivo model for pediatric PRIS.

TI  - alphavbeta1 integrin is enriched in extracellular vesicles of metastatic breastcancer cells: A mechanism mediated by galectin-3.
PG  - e12234
LID - 10.1002/jev2.12234 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer cells release a large quantity of biocargo-bearing extracellularvesicles (EVs), which mediate intercellular communication within the tumourmicroenvironment and promote metastasis. To identify EV-bound proteins related tometastasis, we used mass spectrometry to profile EVs from highly and poorlymetastatic breast cancer lines of human and mouse origins. Comparative massspectrometry indicated that integrins, including alphav and beta1 subunits, arepreferentially enriched in EVs of highly metastatic origin over those of poorlymetastatic origin. These results are consistent with our histopathologicalfindings, which show that integrin alphav is associated with disease progression in breast cancer patients. Integrin alphav colocalizes with themultivesicular-body marker CD63 at a higher frequency in the tumour and isenriched in circulating EVs of breast cancer patients at late stages whencompared with circulating EVs from early-stage patients. With a magneticbead-based flow cytometry assay, we confirmed that integrins alphav and beta1 areenriched in the CD63(+) subsets of EVs from both human and mouse highlymetastatic cells. By analysing the level of integrin alphav on circulating EVs,this assay could predict the metastatic potential of a xenografted mouse model.To explore the export mechanism of integrins into EVs, we performedimmunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and identified members of the galectinfamily as potential shuttlers of integrin alphavbeta1 into EVs. In particular,knockdown of galectin-3, but not galectin-1, causes a reduction in the levels of cell surface integrins beta1 and alphav, and decreases the colocalization ofthese integrins with CD63. Importantly, knockdown of galectin-3 leads to adecrease of integrin alphavbeta1 export into the EVs concomitant with a decrease in the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of theintegrin alphavbeta1 complex leads to a reduction in the binding of EVs tofibronectin, suggesting that integrin alphavbeta1 is important for EV retentionin the extracellular matrix. EVs retained in the extracellular matrix are takenup by fibroblasts, which differentiate into cancer associated fibroblasts. Insummary, our data indicate an important link between EV-bound integrinalphavbeta1 with breast cancer metastasis and provide additional insights intothe export of integrin alphavbeta1 into EVs in the context of metastasis.

LID - 10.14814/phy2.15343 [doi]
AB  - Protease-activated receptors (PAR) play an important role in the regulation ofcellular function by the coagulation system, and they are activated by thrombin. PAR-1 is expressed in both endothelial cells and podocytes in the kidney. Therole of PAR1 in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier is notclear. Anticoagulant-related nephropathy (ARN) is a kidney disease withglomerular hematuria and red blood cell tubular casts. We validated 5/6nephrectomy (5/6NE) in rats as a model of ARN and had demonstrated that directthrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) induces ARN. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the role of PAR-1 in the ARN pathogenesis. 5/6NE rats were treatedwith dabigatran (150 mg/kg/day), PAR-1 inhibitor SCH79797 (1 and 3 mg/kg/day) andPAR-1 agonist TFLLR-NH2 (0.25 and 0.50 micromol/kg/day) for 7 days. Serumcreatinine and hematuria were assessed daily. Kidney morphology was evaluated at the end of the study. In 5/6NE rats treated with either dabigatran or combinationwith a PAR-1 modulator, there was an elevation in serum creatinine, glomerularhematuria, red blood casts in the tubules, and acute tubular epithelial cellinjury. Interestingly, both PAR-1 modulators in a dose-depended manner hadsimilar effects on the serum creatinine levels and hematuria as those ofdabigatran. Dabigatran-induced increase in the systolic blood pressure was notaffected by PAR-1 modulators. In conclusion, the normal function of PAR-1 iscrucial to maintain the glomerular filtration barrier integrity. Eitheractivation or blockage of PAR-1 leads to glomerular hematuria and subsequentacute tubular epithelial cell injury.

TI  - The role of prolactin/vasoinhibins in cardiovascular diseases.
LID - 10.1002/ame2.12264 [doi]
AB  - Prolactin (PRL) is a polypeptide hormone that is mainly synthesized and secreted by the lactotroph cells of the pituitary. There are two main isoforms of PRL:23-kDa PRL (named full-length PRL) and vasoinhibins (including 5.6-18 kDafragments). Both act as circulating hormones and cytokines to stimulate orinhibit vascular formation at different stages and neovascularization, including endothelial cell proliferation and migration, protease production, and apoptosis.However, their effects on vascular function and cardiovascular diseases aredifferent or even contrary. In addition to the structure, secretion regulation,and signal transduction of PRL/vasoinhibins, this review focuses on thepathological mechanism and clinical significance of PRL/vasoinhibins incardiovascular diseases.

Journal of Animal Ecology. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13696.Despite decades of research on population regulation through density dependence, it remains challenging to identify and understand the relative importance ofmechanisms governing open populations of organisms with complex life cycles.McIntosh et al. (2022) manipulated density of aquatic invertebrates in the field,and then followed populations for 2 years to track the effects on abundancethrough multiple life-history stages. The authors found that their densitymanipulation, performed on larvae that were about to pupate, had minimal effects on the number of emergent adults collected several months later. The manipulationhad a similarly negligible influence on the number of egg masses laid at studylocations. The authors attribute this to stochasticity around dispersal of flyingadults through the terrestrial environment. However, later in the study, theauthors found evidence of density-dependent population regulation among larvalstages, seemingly controlled by resource availability. These results suggest thatpopulation dynamics depend on multiple mechanisms operating at different pointsin organisms' life history, which could either help or hinder populationpersistence with disturbance or environmental change.

LID - 10.5650/jos.ess22112 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with sodium butyrate (NaB)on the lipid levels, gene expression, and proteins related to lipid metabolism innonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rat models fed a high-sucrose diet for 3weeks. Supplementation with 1% and 3% NaB reduced high-sucrose-induced hepatictriacylglycerol levels and expression of genes and proteins related to fatty acidsynthesis, such as fatty acid synthase and malic enzyme, in a dose-dependentmanner. NaB supplementation did not affect hepatic cholesterol levels orexpression of genes related to beta-oxidation. NaB may preventhigh-sucrose-induced NAFLD by repressing the fatty acid synthesis pathway.

AB  - Bacterial resistance to already present antibiotics demands for new approaches infield of medicine. Scientists prefer nanoparticles (NPs) due to their promisingpotential in many applications. Two bacterial strains, Escherichia coli andBacillus subtilis were used for biogenic synthesis of NPs. Characterization ofprepared NPs was accomplished using UV-vis spectroscopy and fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The prepared NPs were confirmed by the color changefrom pale yellow to having white deposition for Zn NPs while from dark green tolight green for Ni NPs. UV-vis spectroscopy of E. coli and B. subtilis basedZnNPs showed highest peak at 354nm and 362nm, respectively. Likewise, E. coli andB. subtilis NiNPs showed peaks at 246 nm and 238 nm, respectively. Antibacterial activity of B. subtilis based ZnNPs showed significant (p </= 0.05) zone ofinhibition (ZOI; 27.3+/-0.6) against B. subtilis and 26.66+/-0.67 against E. coliat 100 mg/mL. Antibacterial activity of E. coli based ZnNPs showed 8.3+/-0.3 ZOI against B. subtilis and 6.6+/-0.3 ZOI against E. coli while NiNPs showed(25.0+/-0.0 mm) (ZOI) against B. subtilis and (25.0 +/- 0.3 mm) against E. coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of E. coli ZnNPs showed values of6.7+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 4.7+/-0.3 mug/mL for B. subtilis. MIC of B.subtilis ZnNPs showed 5.3+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 6.6+/-0.3 mug/mL for B.subtilis while NiNPs showed 33.0+/-1.0 mug/mL against E. coli and 24.0+/-1.0mug/mL against B. subtilis as effective inhibitory concentrations. Minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of E. coli ZnNPs showed 7.3+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 8.3+/-0.3 mug/mL for B. subtilis. MBC of B. subtilis ZnNPs showed7.6+/-0.3 mug/mL for E. coli and 8.6+/-0.3 mug/mL for B. subtilis while NiNPsshowed 45.7+/-1.3 mug/mL against E. coli and 33.0+/-1.0 mug/mL against B.subtilis as effective inhibitory concentrations. It was concluded from thecurrent study that biogenically synthesized ZnNPs and NiNPs are effective aspromising antibacterial agents and have potential applications in biomedicalfields.

TI  - Toltrazuril and Diclazuril: comparative evaluation of anti-coccidial drugs using a murine model.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.22-0136 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal coccidiosis caused by Eimeria protozoan species is an economicallyimportant disease, especially in poultry and cattle. Anti-coccidial drugscommonly used for controlling coccidiosis are toltrazuril (TTZ) and diclazuril(DCZ). In this study, the efficacies of TTZ and DCZ were compared using a murine model, and the effect of these treatments on the induction of acquired resistancewas evaluated. Male C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with 1,000 sporulated E.vermiformis oocytes and treated with TTZ or DCZ. The recommended TTZ dose forcattle (15 mg/kg) completely prevented oocyte excretion. But, mice required 5mg/kg of DCZ, which is five times the recommended dose for cattle, to reduceoocyte excretion. In E. vermiformis re-infection, TTZ (15 mg/kg) and DCZ (5mg/kg) treatments did not interfere with the development of acquired resistance. Bodyweight gain was significantly higher in the TTZ-treated group than in thecontrol (untreated/infected) group and the DCZ-treated group, and no significant difference in bodyweight gain was observed between the TTZ-treated group and the healthy (uninfected/untreated) group. Analysis of T lymphocyte subsets in thespleen and mesenteric lymph nodes indicated that the relative populations ofCD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were reduced in the DCZ-treated and control(untreated/infected) groups, suggesting there was immunosuppression during theinfection. However, no reductions in T cell populations were observed in theTTZ-treated group. The results indicated that an optimal anti-coccidial drug isone that can completely break the parasite life cycle in the host animal.

TI  - Economic loss due to treatment of bovine respiratory disease in Japanese Blackcalves arriving at a backgrounding operation in Miyazaki.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.22-0178 [doi]
AB  - The present study assessed the economic loss due to treatment of bovinerespiratory disease (BRD) in Japanese Black calves that were introduced to abackgrounding operation from the age of 3 to 4 months until the age of 10 months.The data collected from a backgrounding operation in Miyazaki, Japan included therecords of 2,690 animals entering the farm from 2013 to 2018. The treatmentduration was defined as the number of days from the beginning to end oftreatment. The cost of treatment was defined as the total cost of treatmentduring the treatment duration. The average incidence of BRD was 54.6%, and therelative frequency of calves that had BRD once, twice, and three or more timesuntil they left the farm was 64.4%, 26.8%, and 8.8%, respectively (total recordeddiagnoses of BRD: 2,494). Among the 2,494 recorded diagnoses, the average andmedian duration of treatment of BRD was 5.9 days and 3.0 days, respectively. The average and median cost of treatment was 7,767 and 5,600 Japanese yen,respectively. A prolonged duration of treatment and high cost of treatment wereassociated with BRD relapse, steers, and early stage of production (P<0.05). Atthe studied farm, the total cost of treatment during the 6-year study period was 19,658,988 yen, and the annual cost was approximately 3 million yen. In summary, the present study showed that BRD had a large economic impact in thisbackgrounding operation.

TI  - The impacts of viral infection and subsequent antimicrobials on themicrobiome-resistome of growing pigs.
PG  - 118
LID - 10.1186/s40168-022-01312-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals for purposes ofpreventing, controlling, and/or treating infections. In swine, a major driver of antimicrobial use is porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is caused by a virus that predisposes infected animals to secondary bacterialinfections. Numerous antimicrobial protocols are used to treat PRRS, but we have little insight into how these treatment schemes impact antimicrobial resistance(AMR) dynamics within the fecal microbiome of commercial swine. The aim of thisstudy was to determine whether different PRRS-relevant antimicrobial treatmentprotocols were associated with differences in the fecal microbiome and resistome of growing pigs. To accomplish this, we used a metagenomics approach tocharacterize and compare the longitudinal wean-to-market resistome and microbiomeof pigs challenged with PRRS virus and then exposed to different antimicrobialtreatments, and a group of control pigs not challenged with PRRS virus and havingminimal antimicrobial exposure. Genomic DNA was extracted from pen-levelcomposite fecal samples from each treatment group and subjected to metagenomicsequencing and microbiome-resistome bioinformatic and statistical analysis.Microbiome-resistome profiles were compared over time and between treatmentgroups. RESULTS: Fecal microbiome and resistome compositions both changedsignificantly over time, with a dramatic and stereotypic shift between weaningand 9 days post-weaning (dpw). Antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) richness anddiversity were significantly higher at earlier time points, while microbiomerichness and diversity were significantly lower. The post-weaning shift wascharacterized by transition from a Bacteroides-dominated enterotype toLactobacillus- and Streptococcus-dominated enterotypes. Both the microbiome andresistome stabilized by 44 dpw, at which point the trajectory ofmicrobiome-resistome maturation began to diverge slightly between the treatmentgroups, potentially due to physical clustering of the pigs. Challenge with PRRSvirus seemed to correspond to the re-appearance of many very rare andlow-abundance ARGs within the feces of challenged pigs. Despite very differentantimicrobial exposures after challenge with PRRS virus, resistome compositionremained largely similar between the treatment groups. Differences in ARGabundance between the groups were mostly driven by temporal changes in abundance that occurred prior to antimicrobial exposures, with the exception of ermG, whichincreased in the feces of treated pigs, and was significantly more abundant inthe feces of these pigs compared to the pigs that did not receive post-PRRSantimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The fecal microbiome-resistome of growing pigsexhibited a stereotypic trajectory driven largely by weaning and physiologicaging of the pigs. Events such as viral illness, antimicrobial exposures, andphysical grouping of the pigs exerted significant yet relatively minor influence over this trajectory. Therefore, the AMR profile of market-age pigs is theculmination of the life history of the individual pigs and the populations towhich they belong. Disease status alone may be a significant driver of AMR inmarket-age pigs, and understanding the interaction between disease processes and antimicrobial exposures on the swine microbiome-resistome is crucial todeveloping effective, robust, and reproducible interventions to control AMR.Video Abstract.

TI  - Overexpressing HPGDS in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells reducesinflammatory state and improves wound healing in type 2 diabetic mice.
PG  - 395
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03082-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In diabetes, delayed wound healing was considered as the result ofexcessive recruitment and retention of pro-inflammatory cells and factors.Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS) was identified from differentlyexpressed genes of diabetic human foot skin. HPGDS is responsible for theproduction of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), an inflammatory mediator. Therefore, weaim to explore whether HPGDS could be a therapeutic target in the diabetic wound (DW). METHOD: In this study, we compared gene expression profilings of diabetichuman foot skin and non-diabetic human foot skin from the Gene Expression Omnibusdatabase. We detected the characteristics of immune components in diabetic micewound and investigated the role and underlying mechanism of the differentlyexpressed Hpgds for the diabetic wound healing. For in vivo studies, weengineered ADSC to overexpress Hpgds (ADSC(Hpgds)) and evaluated its effects ondiabetic wound healing using a full-thickness skin wound model. For in vitrostudies, we evaluated the role of ADSC(Hpgds) conditioned medium and PGD2 onLipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced macrophage. RESULTS: Hpgds was significantlydown-regulated in type 2 diabetic mice wound and its deficiency delayed normalwound healing. ADSC(Hpgds) accelerated DW healing by reducing neutrophil and CD8Tcell recruitment, promoting M2 macrophage polarization and increasing theproduction of growth factors. ADSC(Hpgds) conditioned medium showed superiorcapability in promoting M2 macrophage transition than conditioned medium derived from ADSC alone. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Hpgds is required for wound healing, and ADSC(Hpgds) could accelerate DW healing by improvinganti-inflammatory state and normalizing the proliferation phase of wound healing in mice. These findings provide a new insight in the therapeutic strategy ofdiabetic wound.

PG  - 394
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03100-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinitis pigmentosa is a rod-cone degenerative disease that induces irreversible vision loss. This study probed the protective capacity ofmesenchymal stem cell-derived small EVs (MSC-EVs) on the retinas of rd10 mice andthe underlying mechanism. METHODS: MSC-EVs were injected into the vitreous ofrd10 mice at postnatal day 14 and P21; morphology and function were examined atP28. The mechanism of action was explored by using co-culture of photoreceptorcell line 661 W and microglia cell line BV2. RESULTS: Treatment with MSC-EVsincreased the survival of photoreceptors and preserved their structure. Visualfunction, as reflected by optomotor and electroretinogram responses, wassignificantly enhanced in MSC-EVs-treated rd10 mice. Mechanistically, stainingfor Iba1, GFAP, F4/80, CD68 and CD206 showed that MSC-EVs suppressed theactivation of microglial, Muller glial and macrophages. Furthermore, westernblotting showed that the treatment inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway. RNA-seq andqPCR showed that MSC-EVs upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines whiledownregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. MSC-EVs application in vitro decreasedthe number of TUNEL-positive 661 W cells co-cultured with LPS-stimulated BV2,with similar impact on the cytokine expression as in vivo study. Geneticscreening predicted miR-146a to be the downstream target of MSC-EVs, which wasdetected in MSC-EVs and upregulated in co-cultured 661 W cells and BV2 cellsafter MSC-EVs treatment. Upregulation of miR-146a by using its mimic decreasedthe expression of the transcription factor Nr4a3, and its downregulationinhibition promoted Nr4a3 expression in both 661 W and BV2 cells. Nr4a3 wasfurther identified as the target gene of miR-146a by dual-luciferase assay.Furthermore, overexpressing miR-146a significantly decreased the expression ofLPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: MSC-EVs delays retinal degeneration in rd10 mice mainly by its anti-inflammatory effect via the miR-146a-Nr4a3axis. Hence, MSC-EVs may be used in the treatment ofneurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Targeting clock-controlled gene Nrf2 ameliorates inflammation-inducedintervertebral disc degeneration.
PG  - 181
LID - 10.1186/s13075-022-02876-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc (IVD) is a highly rhythmic tissue, whichexperiences a diurnal cycle of high/low mechanical loading via the changes ofactivity/rest phase. There are signs that disruption of the peripheral IVD clock is related to the process of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, it is still unclear whether inflammation could disturb the IVD clock and thus inducethe process of IDD. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we used IL-1beta, acommonly used inflammatory factor, to induce IDD and found that the IVD clock wasdampened in degenerated human nucleus pulposus specimens, rat nucleus pulposus(NP) tissues, and cells. In this study, we found that the circadian clock of NPcells was totally disrupted by knockdown of the core clock gene brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1), which thus induced the dysfunction of NP cells.Next, we explored the mechanism of dampened clock-induced IDD and found thatknockdown of Bmal1 decreased the expression of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a downstream target gene of Bmal1, and increased inflammatoryresponse, oxidative stress reaction, and apoptosis of NP cells. In addition, NRF2activation attenuated the dysfunction of NP cells induced by the dampened IVDclock and the degenerative process of NP tissues in an organotypic tissue-explantmodel. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study extends the relationship betweenperipheral clock and IVD homeostasis and provides a potential therapeutic method for the prevention and recovery of IDD by targeting the clock-controlled geneNrf2.

TI  - Macrophage-mediated tissue response evoked by subchronic inhalation of lead oxidenanoparticles is associated with the alteration of phospholipases C andcholesterol transporters.
PG  - 52

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhalation of lead oxide nanoparticles (PbO NPs), which are emittedto the environment by high-temperature technological processes, heavily impairstarget organs. These nanoparticles pass through the lung barrier and aredistributed via the blood into secondary target organs, where they cause numerouspathological alterations. Here, we studied in detail, macrophages as specialized cells involved in the innate and adaptive immune response in selected targetorgans to unravel their potential involvement in reaction to subchronic PbO NPinhalation. In this context, we also tackled possible alterations in lipid uptakein the lungs and liver, which is usually associated with foam macrophageformation. RESULTS: The histopathological analysis of PbO NP exposed lungrevealed serious chronic inflammation of lung tissues. The number of total andfoam macrophages was significantly increased in lung, and they contained numerouscholesterol crystals. PbO NP inhalation induced changes in expression ofphospholipases C (PLC) as enzymes linked to macrophage-mediated inflammation inlungs. In the liver, the subchronic inhalation of PbO NPs caused predominantlyhyperemia, microsteatosis or remodeling of the liver parenchyma, and the numberof liver macrophages also significantly was increased. The gene and proteinexpression of a cholesterol transporter CD36, which is associated with lipidmetabolism, was altered in the liver. The amount of selected cholesteryl esters(CE 16:0, CE 18:1, CE 20:4, CE 22:6) in liver tissue was decreased aftersubchronic PbO NP inhalation, while total and free cholesterol in liver tissuewas slightly increased. Gene and protein expression of phospholipase PLCbeta1 andreceptor CD36 in human hepatocytes were affected also in in vitro experimentsafter acute PbO NP exposure. No microscopic or serious functional kidneyalterations were detected after subchronic PbO NP exposure and CD68 positivecells were present in the physiological mode in its interstitial tissues.CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the association of increased cholesterol and lipidstorage in targeted tissues with the alteration of scavenger receptors andphospholipases C after subchronic inhalation of PbO NPs and yet uncoveredprocesses, which can contribute to steatosis in liver after metal nanoparticlesexposure.

TI  - Topical administration of the secretome derived from human amniotic epithelialcells ameliorates psoriasis-like skin lesions in mice.
PG  - 393
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03091-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Tissue stem cellshave exhibited a therapeutic effect on psoriatic mice. However, the therapeuticeffect of topical administration of the secretome derived from tissue stem cells on psoriasis has not been reported. METHODS: The secretome from human amnioticepithelial cells (AEC-SC) and human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells(UMSC-SC) was topically administrated on the back of imiquimod-inducedpsoriasis-like mice. Subsequently, we observed the skin lesions and skininflammation of psoriasis-like mice. Next, we further analyzed the paracrinefactors in AEC-SC and UMSC-SC by protein chips. Lastly, the effect of the crucialparacrine factor was investigated by imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mice.RESULTS: We found that AEC-SC had a better therapeutic effect on attenuatingpsoriasis-like skin lesions including skin scales, skin redness and skinthickness than UMSC-SC, and it had a better regulatory effect on keratinocytehyperproliferation and altered differentiation. Thus, we focused on AEC-SC.Further study showed that AEC-SC reduced the infiltration of neutrophils andinterleukin-17-producing T cells. Next, the analysis of AEC-SC with protein chip revealed that the levels of anti-inflammatory factor interleukin-1 receptorantagonist (IL-1ra) were much higher in AEC-SC compared to that in UMSC-SC. More importantly, the beneficial effect of AEC-SC on psoriasis-like skin lesions andskin inflammation of mice were significantly impaired when neutralizing withIL-1ra antibody, while the recombinant human IL-1ra showed a less protectiveeffect than AEC-SC. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that AEC-SC couldefficiently ameliorate psoriasis-like skin lesions and skin inflammation andIL-1ra plays an essential role. Therefore, topical administration of AEC-SC mayprovide a novel strategy for treating psoriasis-like inflammatory skin diseases.

TI  - Astragalus mongholicus Bunge and Curcuma aromatica Salisb. inhibits livermetastasis of colon cancer by regulating EMT via the CXCL8/CXCR2 axis andPI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
PG  - 91
LID - 10.1186/s13020-022-00641-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most challenging aspects of colon cancer (CC) prognosisand treatment is liver-tropic metastasis. Astragalus mongholicus Bunge-Curcumaaromatica Salisb. (AC) is a typical medication combination for the therapy ofmany malignancies. Our previous studies found that AC intervention inhibits livermetastasis of colon cancer (LMCC). Nevertheless, the comprehensiveanti-metastasis mechanisms of AC have not been uncovered. METHODS: Inbioinformatics analysis, RNA-seq data of CC and LMCC patients were collected fromTCGA and GEO databases, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) wereidentified. The biological processes and signaling pathways involved in DEGs wereenriched by GO and KEGG. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGswas established and visualized using the Cytocape software, followed by screeningHub genes in the PPI network using Degree value as the criterion. Subsequently,the expression and survival relevance of Hub gene in COAD patients were verified.In the experimental study, the effects of AC on the inhibition of colon cancergrowth and liver metastasis were comprehensively evaluated by cellular and animalmodels. Finally, based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, the possiblemechanisms of AC inhibition of colon cancer EMT and liver metastasis wereexplored by in vivo and in vitro pharmacological experiments. RESULTS: In thisstudy, we obtained 2386 DEGs relevant to LMCC from the COAD (colonadenocarcinoma) and GSE38174 datasets. Results of GO gene function and KEGGsignaling pathway enrichment analysis suggested that cellular EMT(Epithelial-mesenchymal transition) biological processes, Cytokine-cytokinereceptor interaction and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways might be closely related to LMCC mechanism. We then screened for CXCL8, the core hub gene with the highestcentrality within the PPI network of DEGs, and discovered that CXCL8 expressionwas negatively correlated with the prognosis of COAD patients. In vitro and invivo experimental evidence presented that AC significantly inhibited colon cancercell proliferation, migration and invasion ability, and suppressed tumor growthand liver metastasis in colon cancer orthotopic transplantation mice models.Concomitantly, AC significantly reduced CXCL8 expression levels in cellsupernatants and serum. Moreover, AC reduced the expression and transcription of genes related to the PI3K/AKT pathway while suppressing the EMT process in colon cancer cells and model mice. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our research predicted the potential targets and pathways of LMCC, and experimentally demonstrated that ACmight inhibit the growth and liver metastasis in colon cancer by regulating EMTvia the CXCL8/CXCR2 axis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which mayfacilitate the discovery of mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies for LMCC.

TI  - Aprepitant attenuates NLRC4-dependent neuronal pyroptosis via NK1R/PKCdeltapathway in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02558-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death mediated by inflammasomes.Previous studies have reported that inhibition of neurokinin receptor 1 (NK1R)exerted neuroprotection in several neurological diseases. Herein, we haveinvestigated the role of NK1R receptor inhibition using Aprepitant to attenuateNLRC4-dependent neuronal pyroptosis after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), as wellas the underlying mechanism. METHODS: A total of 182 CD-1 mice were used. ICH wasinduced by injection of autologous blood into the right basal ganglia.Aprepitant, a selective antagonist of NK1R, was injected intraperitoneally at 1 hafter ICH. To explore the underlying mechanism, NK1R agonist, GR73632, andprotein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) agonist, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),were injected intracerebroventricularly at 1 h after ICH induction, and smallinterfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) for NLRC4 was administered viaintracerebroventricular injection at 48 h before ICH induction, respectively.Neurobehavioral tests, western blot, and immunofluorescence staining wereperformed. RESULTS: The expression of endogenous NK1R and NLRC 4 were graduallyincreased after ICH. NK1R was expressed on neurons. Aprepitant significantlyimproved the short- and long-term neurobehavioral deficits after ICH, which wasaccompanied with decreased neuronal pyroptosis, as well as decreased expressionof NLRC4, Cleaved-caspase-1, GSDMD (gasdermin D), IL-1beta, and IL-18. Activationof NK1R or PKCdelta abolished these neuroprotective effects of Aprepitant afterICH. Similarly, knocking down NLRC4 using siRNA produced similar neuroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: Aprepitant suppressed NLRC4-dependent neuronal pyroptosisand improved neurological function, possibly mediated by inhibition ofNK1R/PKCdelta signaling pathways after ICH. The NK1R may be a promisingtherapeutic target for the treatment of ICH.

TI  - Landscape of lipidomic metabolites in gut-liver axis of Sprague-Dawley rats afteroral exposure to titanium dioxide nanoparticles.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s12989-022-00484-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) as food additives poses a risk of oral exposure that may lead to adverse health effects. Even though the substantial evidence supported liver as the target organ of TiO2 NPs via oral exposure, the mechanism of liver toxicity remains largely unknown.Since the liver is a key organ for lipid metabolism, this study focused on thelandscape of lipidomic metabolites in gut-liver axis of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to TiO2 NPs at 0, 2, 10, 50 mg/kg body weight per day for 90 days.RESULTS: TiO2 NPs (50 mg/kg) caused slight hepatotoxicity and changed lipidomicsignatures of main organs or systems in the gut-liver axis including liver, serumand gut. The cluster profile from the above biological samples all pointed to thesame key metabolic pathway and metabolites, which was glycerophospholipidmetabolism and Phosphatidylcholines (PCs), respectively. In addition, absolutequantitative lipidomics verified the changes of three PCs concentrations,including PC (16:0/20:1), PC (18:0/18:0) and PC (18:2/20:2) in the serum samples after treatment of TiO2 NPs (50 mg/kg). The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum and liver increased significantly, which were positively correlated withmost differential lipophilic metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: The gut was presumed to bethe original site of oxidative stress and disorder of lipid metabolism, whichresulted in hepatotoxicity through the gut-liver axis. Lipid peroxidation may be the initial step of lipid metabolism disorder induced by TiO2 NPs. Mostnanomaterials (NMs) have oxidation induction and antibacterial properties, so thetoxic pathway revealed in the present study may be primary and universal.

TI  - Incidence and risk factors of preoperative deep vein thrombosis in patients with intertrochanteric fractures: a retrospective study.
PG  - 375
LID - 10.1186/s13018-022-03268-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of perioperative complications remains high in patients withintertrochanteric fractures. Immobilization after injury may predispose thesepatients to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while waiting for surgery. The aims ofthis study were to determine the incidence of preoperative DVT in patients withintertrochanteric fractures and identify independent risk factors. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with intertrochanteric fractures waitingfor surgical interventions at our institution from June 2018 to December 2020.All patients received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after admission andultrasound screening for DVT in both lower limbs before surgery. Demographic,clinical and laboratory data of these patients were collected to performunivariate analysis first. Subsequently, factors with a significant difference inunivariate analysis were introduced into the multivariate logistic regressionanalysis to determine the independent risk factors for preoperative DVT. RESULTS:A total of 266 patients were enrolled in this study. Seventy-one patients (26.7%)developed DVTs before surgery. The majority of DVTs were distal types (91.5%).There were 40 patients with DVTs only in the affected limb, 7 patients with DVTs only in the unaffected limb, and 24 patients with DVTs in both lower limbs.Advanced age, female, prolonged period from injury to admission, combined cranialtrauma, shorter thrombin time, increased level of D-dimer and lower level ofalbumin proved to be the independent risk factors for preoperative DVT.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high incidence of preoperative DVT in patients withintertrochanteric fractures. Identification of patients at high risk may improve the prevention and treatment of preoperative DVT in this population.

TI  - Evolutionary conserved relocation of chromatin remodeling complexes to themitotic apparatus.
PG  - 172
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01365-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are multi-proteinmachines highly conserved across eukaryotic genomes. They control sliding anddisplacing of the nucleosomes, modulating histone-DNA interactions and makingnucleosomal DNA more accessible to specific binding proteins during replication, transcription, and DNA repair, which are processes involved in cell division. TheSRCAP and p400/Tip60 chromatin remodeling complexes in humans and the relatedDrosophila Tip60 complex belong to the evolutionary conserved INO80 family, whosemain function is promoting the exchange of canonical histone H2A with the histonevariant H2A in different eukaryotic species. Some subunits of these complexeswere additionally shown to relocate to the mitotic apparatus and proposed to playdirect roles in cell division in human cells. However, whether this phenomenonreflects a more general function of remodeling complex components and itsevolutionary conservation remains unexplored. RESULTS: We have combined cellbiology, reverse genetics, and biochemical approaches to study the subcellulardistribution of a number of subunits belonging to the SRCAP and p400/Tip60complexes and assess their involvement during cell division progression in HeLacells. Interestingly, beyond their canonical chromatin localization, the subunitsunder investigation accumulate at different sites of the mitotic apparatus(centrosomes, spindle, and midbody), with their depletion yielding an array ofaberrant outcomes of mitosis and cytokinesis, thus causing genomic instability.Importantly, this behavior was conserved by the Drosophila melanogaster orthologstested, despite the evolutionary divergence between fly and humans has beenestimated at approximately 780 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ourresults support the existence of evolutionarily conserved diverse roles ofchromatin remodeling complexes, whereby subunits of the SRCAP and p400/Tip60complexes relocate from the interphase chromatin to the mitotic apparatus,playing moonlighting functions required for proper execution of cell division.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a major public health problem in Sri Lanka. Aedes vectorsurveillance and monitoring of larval indices are routine, long-establishedpublic health practices in the country. However, the association between Aedeslarval indices and dengue incidence is poorly understood. It is crucial toevaluate lagged effects and threshold values of Aedes larval indices to setpragmatic targets for sustainable vector control interventions. METHODS: Monthly Aedes larval indices and dengue cases in all 10 Medical Officer of Health (MOH)divisions in Kalutara district were obtained from 2010 to 2019. Using a novelstatistical approach, a distributed lag non-linear model and a two-stagedhierarchical meta-analysis, we estimated the overall non-linear and delayedeffects of the Premise Index (PI), Breteau Index (BI) and Container Index (CI) ondengue incidence in Kalutara district. A set of MOH division-specific variableswere evaluated within the same meta-analytical framework to determine theirmoderator effects on dengue risk. Using generalized additive models, we assessed the utility of Aedes larval indices in predicting dengue incidence. RESULTS: Wefound that all three larval indices were associated with dengue risk at a lag of 1 to 2 months. The relationship between PI and dengue was homogeneous across MOH divisions, whereas that with BI and CI was heterogeneous. The threshold values ofBI, PI and CI associated with dengue risk were 2, 15 and 45, respectively. Allthree indices showed a low to moderate accuracy in predicting dengue risk inKalutara district. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the potential of vectorsurveillance information in Kalutara district in developing a threshold-based,location-specific early warning system with a lead time of 2 months. Theestimated thresholds are nonetheless time-bound and may not be universallyapplicable. Whenever longitudinal vector surveillance data areavailable, themethodological framework we propose here can be used to estimatelocation-specific Aedes larval index thresholds in any other dengue-endemicsetting.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of delivering mass drug administration for helminthsthrough the seasonal malaria chemoprevention platform among Senegalese children: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 627
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06579-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major health problem, especially in sub-SaharanAfrica where more than 90% of the disease and where nearly all deaths occur inchildren. Adding to this high burden is the co-existence of intestinal andgenito-urinary helminth infections. Existing control programmes for thesehelminths are operating sub-optimally. Conversely, a malaria preventionprogramme, called seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), introduced in 2012 has achieved more than 75% treatment coverage and prevented 75-85% cases ofuncomplicated and severe malaria in children. This encouraging developmentsupports the need to explore strategies involving the integration of helminthcontrol with successful platforms such as SMC. This would align worm and malaria control within the Sustainable Development Goals of ending the diseases ofpoverty and promoting health and well-being for those at risk. METHODS: Thisstudy will have quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitativecomponent will be a three-arm, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, interventionalstudy of co-administration of SMC and anthelminthic drugs to pre-school andschool-age children in Saraya district, southeast Senegal. Six hundred childrenaged 1-14 years will be randomly assigned to receive either SMC drugs only, SMCdrugs and praziquantel or SMC drugs and albendazole and praziquantel at a ratioof 1:1:1. The primary outcome will be solicited and unsolicited adverse reactionsto the study medications. The secondary outcomes will be the prevalence andintensity of Plasmodium-helminth co-infection and the prevalence of anaemia andmean haemoglobin concentration. The qualitative component of the study willinclude the conduct of structured interviews to assess the acceptability,feasibility, enablers and barriers to the combined use of anthelminthic and SMCdrugs among randomly selected parents/caregivers of children enrolled in thestudy and health care workers responsible for the delivery of the combinedservices. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence to boost the public healthrecommendations for combined malaria and helminth control. If successful, thisproject will reinforce the evidence that health care systems in developingcountries can be comprehensive health management rather than focussed on verticalmanagement of a single disease.

PG  - 626
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06526-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerativedisease, characterised by oligodendrocyte death and demyelination.Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells can differentiate into new replacementoligodendrocytes; however, remyelination is insufficient to protect neurons from degeneration in people with MS. We previously reported that 4 weeks of dailylow-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in anintermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) pattern increased the number of newmyelinating oligodendrocytes in healthy adult mice. This study translates thisrTMS protocol and aims to determine its safety and tolerability for people livingwith MS. We will also perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and symptomassessments as preliminary indicators of myelin addition following rTMS. METHODS:Participants (N = 30, aged 18-65 years) will have a diagnosis ofrelapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS. </=2 weeks before theintervention, eligible, consenting participants will complete a physical exam,baseline brain MRI scan and participant-reported MS symptom assessments[questionnaires: Fatigue Severity Scale, Quality of Life (AQoL-8D), HospitalAnxiety and Depression Scale; and smartphone-based measures of cognition(electronic symbol digit modalities test), manual dexterity (pinching test, draw a shape test) and gait (U-Turn test)]. Participants will be pseudo-randomlyallocated to rTMS (n=20) or sham (placebo; n=10), stratified by sex. rTMS or shamwill be delivered 5 days per week for 4 consecutive weeks (20 sessions, 6 min perday). rTMS will be applied using a 90-mm circular coil at low-intensity (25%maximum stimulator output) in an iTBS pattern. For sham, the coil will beoriented 90 degrees to the scalp, preventing the magnetic field from stimulating the brain. Adverse events will be recorded daily. We will evaluate participantblinding after the first, 10th and final session. After the final session,participants will repeat symptom assessments and brain MRI, for comparison withbaseline. Participant-reported assessments will be repeated at 4-monthpost-allocation follow-up. DISCUSSION: This study will determine whether thisrTMS protocol is safe and tolerable for people with MS. MRI andparticipant-reported symptom assessments will serve as preliminary indications ofrTMS efficacy for myelin addition to inform further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lumpy skin disease is a contagious viral disease of cattle caused by LSDV that results in huge economic losses in the cattle industry. This studycharacterizes LSDV in cattle through clinicopathological and molecular techniquesin selected districts of Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: Acrossectional study was conducted from November 2020 to June 2021 using Real-timepolymerase chain reaction and Histopathological techniques to confirm LSDV.RESULT: This study revealed that the percentage of positivity of cattle for LSDV was 36.2%. Clinically, cattle infected with LSDV revealed fever (39-41 degreesC), nodular lesions on the skin and mucous membranes, and lymphadenopathy.Histopathologically, affected tissue revealed ballooning degenerations of theepidermis, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells, vasculitis, andintracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies. RT-PCR confirmed that DNAextracts from skin biopsies of virus isolates were positive for LSDV. CONCLUSION:The present study confirms that LSDV is widely circulating in cattle of selected districts of the Wolaita zone. Thus, effective control measures through regularvaccination and further confirmation of circulating strains of LSDV throughdetailed molecular analysis should be recommended.

TI  - Effect of radiant catalytic ionization on environmental conditions in rodentrooms and the haematological status of mice.
PG  - 298
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03402-5 [doi]
AB  - High stocking densities, closed animal houses, and elevated concentrations ofbacteria, fungi, and the products of their activity, including ammonia andhydrogen sulphide, have adverse health effects. Active techniques used to reduce unfavourable environmental conditions, such as ventilation, sprinkling, beddingsorbents, and nutritional treatments, are not always sufficient to improve theanimals' living environment. The current paper aims to evaluate the effect ofradiant catalytic ionization (RCI) on airborne microorganisms, cagemicrobiological status, gaseous ammonia concentrations, and the haematologicalstatus of mice in animal houses. After one week of operation of an RCI system,the number of airborne bacteria and fungi in the experimental room decreased incomparison to the first day of the experiment (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05respectively), as did the concentrations of ammonia (p < 0.01) and dust. At thesame time, the basic health parameters of the mice, determined in the blood, werevery similar between the control and experimental room. RCI seems to be an ideal solution to ensure high hygiene standards in animal rooms and houses with limiteduse of disinfectants or antibiotic treatment of sick animals. An additional,environmental benefit is the limited amount of nitrogen released.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of surface display technology intherapeutic development and enzyme immobilization. Utilization of lactic acidbacteria in non-GMO surface display applications is advantageous due to its GRAS status. This study aimed to develop a novel, non-GMO cell wall anchoring systemfor lactic acid bacteria using a cell-surface hydrolase (CshA) fromLactiplantibacillus plantarum SK156 for potential industrial and biomedicalapplications. Analysis of the CshA revealed that it does not contain any knownclassical anchor domains. Although CshA lacks a classical anchor domain, itsuccessfully displayed the reporter protein superfolder GFP on the surface ofseveral lactic acid bacteria in host dependent manner. CshA-sfGFP fusion protein was displayed greatest on Limosilactobacillus fermentum SK152. Pretreatment with trichloroacetic acid further enhanced the binding of CshA to Lm. fermentum. Thebinding conditions of CshA on pretreated Lm. fermentum (NaCl, pH, time, andtemperature) were also optimized, resulting in a maximum binding of up to 10(6)CshA molecules per pretreated Lm. fermentum cell. Finally, this studydemonstrated that CshA-decorated pretreated Lm. fermentum cells toleratesgastrointestinal stress, such as low pH and presence of bile acid. To ourknowledge, this study is the first to characterize and demonstrate thecell-surface display ability of CshA. The potential application of CshA innon-GMO antigen delivery system and enzyme immobilization remains to be tested.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis revealed gene expression feminization of testis afterexogenous tetrodotoxin administration in pufferfish Takifugu flavidus.
PG  - 553

AB  - Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a deadly neurotoxin and usually accumulates in largeamounts in the ovaries but is non-toxic or low toxic in the testis of pufferfish.The molecular mechanism underlying sexual dimorphism accumulation of TTX in ovaryand testis, and the relationship between TTX accumulation with sex related genes expression remain largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of exogenous TTX treatment on Takifugu flavidus. The results demonstrated thatexogenous TTX administration significantly incresed level of TTX concentration inkidney, cholecyst, skin, liver, heart, muscle, ovary and testis of the treatment group (TG) than that of the control group (CG). Transcriptome sequencing andanalysis were performed to study differential expression profiles of mRNA andpiRNA after TTX administration of the ovary and testis. The results showed thatcompared with female control group (FCG) and male control group (MCG), TTXadministration resulted in 80 and 23 piRNAs, 126 and 223 genes up and downregulated expression in female TTX-treated group (FTG), meanwhile, 286 and 223piRNAs, 2 and 443 genes up and down regulated expression in male TTX-treatedgroup (MTG). The female dominant genes cyp19a1, gdf9 and foxl2 were found to beup-regulated in MTG. The cyp19a1, whose corresponding target piRNA uniq_554482was identified as down-regulated in the MTG, indicating the gene expressionfeminization in testis after exogenous TTX administration. The KEGG enrichmentanalysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and piRNAs(DEpiRNAs) in MTG vs MCG group were more enriched in metabolism pathways,indicating that the testis produced more metabolic pathways in response toexogenous TTX, which might be a reason for the sexual dimorphism of TTXdistribution in gonads. In addition, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelingstaining showed that significant apoptosis was detected in the MTG testis, andthe role of the cell apoptotic pathways was further confirmed. Overall, ourresearch revealed that the response of the ovary and testis to TTX administrationwas largely different, the ovary is more tolerant whereas the testis is moresensitive to TTX. These data will deepen our understanding on the accumulation ofTTX sexual dimorphism in Takifugu.

TI  - Inhibition of hyperprogressive cancer disease induced by immune-checkpointblockade upon co-treatment with meta-tyrosine and p38 pathway inhibitor.
PG  - 845
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09941-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are overall promissoryfor cancer treatment, they entail, in some cases, an undesired side-effect calledhyperprogressive-cancer disease (HPD) associated with acceleration of tumorgrowth and shortened survival. METHODS: To understand the mechanisms of HPD weassayed the ICI therapy on two murine tumors widely different regardingimmunogenicity and, subsequently, on models of local recurrences and metastasesof these tumors. To potentiate the immune response (IR), we combined ICI withmeta-tyrosine-that counteracts immune-suppressive signals-and a selectiveinhibitor of p38 pathway that proved to counteract the phenomenon oftumor-immunostimulation. RESULTS: ICI were therapeutically effective against bothtumor models (proportionally to their immunogenicity) but only when they facedincipient tumors. In contrast, ICI produced acceleration of large and residualtumors. The combined treatment strongly inhibited the growth of large tumors and it managed to cure 80% of mice with local recurrences and 60% of mice bearingresidual metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor enhancement was paradoxically correlated to a weak increase of the antitumor IR suggesting that a weak IR - different froma strong tumor-inhibitory one-may produce stimulation of tumor growth, mimicking the HPD observed in some clinical settings.

TI  - Oxalate-induced apoptosis through ERS-ROS-NF-kappaB signalling pathway in renaltubular epithelial cell.
PG  - 88
LID - 10.1186/s10020-022-00494-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney stones are composed of approximately 70-80% calcium oxalate.However, the exact mechanism of formation of calcium oxalate kidney stonesremains unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmicreticulum stress (ERS), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the NF-kappaBsignalling pathway in the pathogenesis of oxalate-induced renal tubularepithelial cell injury and its possible molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Weestablished a model to evaluate the formation of kidney stones by intraperitonealinjection of glyoxylic acid solution into mice and assessed cell morphology,apoptosis, and the expression levels of ERS, ROS, and NF-kappaB signallingpathway-related proteins in mouse renal tissues. Next, we treated HK-2 cells withpotassium oxalate to construct a renal tubular epithelial cell injury model. Wedetected the changes in autophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membranepotential and investigated the ultrastructure of the cells by transmissionelectron microscopy. Western blotting revealed the expression levels of apoptosisand autophagy proteins; mitochondrial structural and functional proteins; andERS, ROS, and NF-kappaB (p65) proteins. Lastly, we studied the downregulation of NF-kappaB activity in HK-2 cells by lentivirus interference and confirmed theinteraction between the NF-kappaB signalling and ERS/ROS pathways. RESULTS: Weobserved swelling of renal tissues, increased apoptosis of renal tubularepithelial cells, and activation of the ERS, ROS, and NF-kappaB signallingpathways in the oxalate group. We found that oxalate induced autophagy,apoptosis, and mitochondrial damage in HK-2 cells and activated theERS/ROS/NF-kappaB pathways. Interestingly, when the NF-kappaB signalling pathway was inhibited, the ERS/ROS pathway was also inhibited. CONCLUSION: Oxalateinduces HK-2 cell injury through the interaction between the NF-kappaB signallingand ERS/ROS pathways.

TI  - Effects of silicon application on leaf structure and physiologicalcharacteristics of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. and Glycyrrhiza inflata Bat.under salt treatment.
PG  - 390
LID - 10.1186/s12870-022-03783-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soil salinization leads to a significant decline in crop yield andquality, including licorice, an important medicinal cash crop. Studies haveproofed that the application of exogenous silicon can significantly improve theability of licorice to resist salt stress, however, few studies concentrated onthe effects of foliar silicon application on the morphology, physiologicalcharacteristics, and anatomical structure of licorice leaves under salt stress.In this study, the effects of Si (K2SiO3) on the structural and physiologicalcharacteristics of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. and G. inflata Bat. leaves under different salt concentrations (medium- and high-salt) were studied. RESULTS:Compared with the control (without salt), the plant height, total dry weight,leaf area, leaf number, relative water content, xylem area, phloem area, ratio ofpalisade to spongy tissue, gas exchange parameters, and photosynthetic pigmentcontent of both licorice varieties were significantly reduced under high-salt(12S) conditions. However, the thickness of the leaf, palisade tissue, and spongytissue increased significantly. Applying Si to the leaf surface increased thearea of the vascular bundle, xylem, and parenchyma of the leaf's main vein,promoted water transportation, enhanced the relative leaf water content, andreduced the decomposition of photosynthetic pigments. These changes extended the area of photosynthesis and promoted the production and transportation of organic matter. G. uralensis had a better response to Si application than did G. inflata.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, foliar application of Si can improve waterabsorption, enhance photosynthesis, improve photosynthetic capacity andtranspiration efficiency, promote growth and yield, and alleviate the adverseeffects of salt stress on the leaf structure of the two kinds of licoriceinvestigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The expression and biological functions of circular RNAs (circRNAs)in reproductive organs have been extensively reported. However, it is stillunclear whether circRNAs are involved in sex change. To this end, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed in gonads at 5 sexual stages (ovary, early intersexualstage gonad, middle intersexual stage gonad, late intersexual stage gonad, andtestis) of ricefield eel, and the expression profiles and potential functions of circRNAs were studied. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty-one circRNAs wereidentified, and the expression levels of 10 circRNAs were verified byquantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and found to be in accordance with theRNA-seq data, suggesting that the RNA-seq data were reliable. Then, the sequence length, category, sequence composition and the relationship between the parentgenes of the circRNAs were explored. A total of 147 circRNAs were differentially expressed in the sex change process, and GO and KEGG analyses revealed that some differentially expressed (such as novel_circ_0000659, novel_circ_0004005 andnovel_circ_0005865) circRNAs were closely involved in sex change. Furthermore,expression pattern analysis demonstrated that both circSnd1 and foxl2 weredownregulated in the process of sex change, which was contrary to mal-miR-135b.Finally, dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation showed thatcircSnd1 and foxl2 can combine with mal-miR-135b and mal-miR-135c. These datarevealed that circSnd1 regulates foxl2 expression in the sex change of ricefield eel by acting as a sponge of mal-miR-135b/c. CONCLUSION: Our results are thefirst to demonstrate that circRNAs have potential effects on sex change inricefield eel; and circSnd1 could regulate foxl2 expression in the sex change of ricefield eel by acting as a sponge of mal-miR-135b/c. These data will be useful for enhancing our understanding of sequential hermaphroditism and sex change inricefield eel or other teleosts.

TI  - Activation of the sigma-1 receptor exerts cardioprotection in a rodent model ofchronic heart failure by stimulation of angiogenesis.
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/s10020-022-00517-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis plays a critical role on post-infarction heart failure(PIHF), the presence of which facilitates additional blood supply to maintain thesurvival of residual cardiomyocytes. The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has beensubstantiated to stimulate angiogenesis, with the effect on a model of PIHFremaining unknown. AIMS: This study aims to investigate the effects of S1R onPIHF and the underlying mechanisms involved. METHODS: Rats were implemented left anterior descending artery ligation followed by rearing for 6 weeks to induce aphenotype of heart failure. Daily intraperitoneal injection of S1R agonist orantagonist for 5 weeks was applied from 2nd week after surgery. The effectsexerted by S1R were detected by echocardiography, hemodynamic testing, westernblot, Sirius red dyeing, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence. We alsocultured HUVECs to verify the mechanisms in vitro. RESULTS: Stimulation of S1Rsignificantly ameliorated the cardiac function resulted from PIHF, in addition tothe observation of reduced fibrosis in the peri-infarct region and the apoptosis of residual cardiomyocytes, which were associated with augmentation ofmicrovascular density in peri-infarct region through activation of the JAK2/STAT3pathway. We also indicated that suppression of JAK2/STAT3 pathway by specificinhibitor in vitro reversed the pro-angiogenic effects of S1R on HUVECs, whichfurther confirmed that angiogenesis, responsible for PIHF amelioration, by S1Rstimulation was in a JAK2/STAT3 pathway-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: S1Rstimulation improved PIHF-induced cardiac dysfunction and ventricular remodeling through promoting angiogenesis by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

TI  - Managing genetic diversity in breeding programs of small populations: the case ofFrench local chicken breeds.
PG  - 56
LID - 10.1186/s12711-022-00746-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: On-going climate change will drastically modify agriculture in thefuture, with a need for more sustainable systems, in particular regarding animal production. In this context, genetic diversity is a key factor for adaptation to new conditions: local breeds likely harbor unique adaptive features and representa key component of diversity to reach resilience. However, local breeds oftensuffer from small population sizes, which puts these valuable resources at riskof extinction. In chickens, population management programs were initiated a fewdecades ago in France, relying on a particular niche market that aims atpromoting and protecting local breeds. We conducted a unique comprehensive study of 22 French local breeds, along with four commercial lines, to evaluate theirgenetic conservation status and the efficiency of the population managementprograms. RESULTS: Using a 57K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip, wedemonstrated that both the between- and within-breed genetic diversity levels arehigh in the French local chicken populations. Diversity is mainly structuredaccording to the breeds' selection and history. Nevertheless, we observed aprominent sub-structuring of breeds according to farmers' practices in terms ofexchange, leading to more or less isolated flocks. By analysing demographicparameters and molecular information, we showed that consistent managementprograms are efficient in conserving genetic diversity, since breeds thatintegrated such programs earlier had older inbreeding. CONCLUSIONS: Managementprograms of French local chicken breeds have maintained their genetic diversityat a good level. We recommend that future programs sample as many individuals as possible, with emphasis on both males and females from the start, and focus on a quick and strong increase of population size while conserving as many families aspossible. We also stress the usefulness of molecular tools to monitor smallpopulations for which pedigrees are not always available. Finally, the breedappears to be an appropriate operational unit for the conservation of geneticdiversity, even for local breeds, for which varieties, if present, could also be taken into account.

LID - 10.1007/s11064-022-03691-0 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive motor neurodegenerative disordersignificantly associated with protein aggregation related neurodegenerativemechanisms. In view of no disease modifying drugs, the present study was targetedto investigate the therapeutic effects of pharmacological agent 4-phenylbutyricacid (4PBA) in PD pathology. 4PBA is an FDA approved monocarboxylic acid withinhibitory activity towards histone deacetylase and clinically treats urea cycle disorder. First, we observed the significant protective effects of 4PBA on PDspecific neuromuscular coordination, level of tyrosine hydroxylase,alpha-synuclein level and neurotransmitter dopamine in both substantia nigra and striatal regions of the experimental rat model of PD. Further results revealedthat treatment with 4PBA drug exhibited significant protection against diseaserelated oxidative stress and augmented nitrite levels. The diseasepathology-related depletion in mitochondrial membrane potential and augmentedlevel of calcium as well as mitochondrion membrane located VDAC1 protein leveland cytochrome-c translocation were also significantly attenuated with 4PBAadministration. Inhibited neuronal apoptosis and restored neuronal morphologywere also observed with 4PBA treatment as measured by level of pro-apoptoticproteins t-Bid, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 along with cresyl violet staining inboth substantia nigra and striatal regions. Lastly, PD-linked astrocyteactivation was significantly inhibited with 4PBA treatment. Altogether, ourfindings suggest that 4PBA exerts broad-spectrum neuroprotective effects in PDanimal model.

AB  - Pharmacological treatments against Alzheimer disease provide only symptomaticrelief and are associated with numerous side effects. Previous studies showedthat a concoction of Ziziphus jujuba leaves possesses anti-amnesic effects inscopolamine-treated rats. More recently, an aqueous macerate of Z. jujuba leaves has been shown to reduce short-term memory impairment in D-galactose-treatedrats. However, no study on the effect of an aqueous macerate of Z. jujuba onlong-term memory impairment was performed. Therefore, this study evaluates theeffect of an aqueous macerate of Z. jujuba on long-term spatial memory impairmentin D-galactose-treated rats. Long-term spatial memory impairment was induced inrats by administering D-galactose (350 mg/kg/day, s.c.), once dailyfor 21 days.On the 22nd day, the integrity of this memory was assessed using the Morris watermaze task. Rats that developed memory impairment were treated with tacrine (10mg/kg, p.o.), or aspirin (20 mg/kg, p.o.), or extract (41.5, 83, and 166 mg/kg,p.o.), once daily, for 14 days. At the end of the treatment, memory impairmentwas once more assessed using the same paradigm. Animals were then euthanized, andsome pro-inflammatory cytokine markers were analyzed in the hippocampus or blood.The extract at all doses significantly reduced the latency to attain theplatforming of the water maze test. The extract (83 mg/kg) also increased thetime spent in the target quadrant during the retention phase. The extractmarkedly reduced the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine markers in thehippocampus and blood. Together, these results suggest that this aqueous extract Z. jujuba reduces long-term spatial memory impairment. This effect may bemediated in part by its anti-inflammatory activity.

TI  - Anti-Caspr-conjugated gold nanoparticles emergence as a novel approach in thetreatment of EAE animal model.
LID - 10.1007/s11011-022-00981-y [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of central nervoussystem which is increasing worldwide. Although immunosuppressive agents are used for the treatment of MS disease, nevertheless the lack of non-toxic and efficienttherapeutic method is perceptible. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the effect of Contactin-associated protein (Caspr) antibody-, poly ethylene glycol (PEG)-and exosome combined gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in comparison to Glatirameracetate as a selective treatment of MS disease in the experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice and25-day treatment with anti-Caspr-, PEG- and exosome combined GNPs was evaluated. Histopathological examination of spinal cord, regulatory T cells as well asinflammatory pathway including IFN- and IL-17 and mir-326 were investigated. The results showed the severity of MS symptoms was significantly decreased in alltreated groups. Histological examination of the spinal cord indicated the reduceddemyelination and immune cell infiltration. Besides, regulatory T cells weresignificantly increased following all treatments. Remarkably, the cytokine levelsof IFN- and IL-17 as well as mir-326 is altered in treated groups. Takentogether, the obtained findings demonstrate that the administration ofanti-Caspr-, PEG- and exosome combined GNPs can be considered a potentialtreatment in MS disease.

TI  - Effects of Progesterone on Preclinical Animal Models of Traumatic Brain Injury:Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s12035-022-02970-9 [doi]
AB  - Since the publication of two phase III clinical trials not supporting the use of progesterone in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), several possibleexplanations have been postulated, including limitations in the analysis ofresults from preclinical evidence. Therefore, to address this question, asystematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects ofprogesterone as a neuroprotective agent in preclinical animal models of TBI. Atotal of 48 studies were included for review: 29 evaluated brain edema, 21evaluated lesion size, and 0 studies reported the survival rate. In themeta-analysis, it was found that progesterone reduced brain edema (effect size - 1.73 [- 2.02, - 1.44], p < 0.0001) and lesion volume (effect size - 0.40 [- 0.65,- 0.14], p = 0.002). Lack of details in the studies hindered the assessment ofrisk of bias (through the SYRCLE tool). A funnel plot asymmetry was detected,suggesting a possible publication bias. In conclusion, preclinical studies showthat progesterone has an anti-edema effect in animal models of TBI, decreasinglesion volume or increasing remaining tissue. However, more studies are neededusing assessing methods with lower risk of histological artifacts.

LID - 10.1007/s42770-022-00795-1 [doi]
AB  - Swine pasteurellosis is one of the most economically important diseases of pigcaused by Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) capsular types A and D. Theseorganisms are commensals and opportunistic pathogens in the upper respiratorytract in pig. In the present study, we extracted whole outer membrane proteins(OMP) from P. multocida capsular types A and D and were mixed together in theratio of 1:1 forming bivalent outer-membrane proteins. The bivalent OMP wasadsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles. The size of aluminum hydroxidenanoparticles adsorbed outer membrane protein was found to be in the range of 125to 130 nm. We observed that aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles adjuvanted bivalent OMP-based vaccine elicited quicker immune kinetics in terms of IgG response ascompared to aluminum hydroxide microparticles adjuvanted bivalent bacterinvaccine against P. multocida capsular type A and D.

TI  - Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation response overrides glucocorticoid-inducedstress in a reptile.
LID - 10.1007/s00360-022-01454-5 [doi]
AB  - Stress hormones and their impacts on whole organism metabolic rates are usuallyconsidered as appropriate proxies for animal energy budget that is the foundationof numerous concepts and models aiming at predicting individual and populationresponses to environmental stress. However, the dynamics of energy re-allocation under stress make the link between metabolism and corticosterone complex andstill unclear. Using ectopic application of corticosterone for 3, 11 and 21 days,we estimated a time effect of stress in a lizard (Zootoca vivipara). We theninvestigated whole organism metabolism, muscle cellular O2 consumption and liver mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation processes (O2 consumption and ATPproduction) and ROS production. The data showed that while skeletal muscle is notimpacted, stress regulates the liver mitochondrial functionality in atime-dependent manner with opposing pictures between the different timeexpositions to corticosterone. While 3 days exposition is characterized by lower ATP synthesis rate and high H2O2 release with no change in the rate of oxygenconsumption, the 11 days exposition reduced all three fluxes of about 50%.Oxidative phosphorylation capacities in liver mitochondria of lizard treated withcorticosterone for 21 days was similar to the hepatic mitochondrial capacities inlizards that received no corticosterone treatment but with 40% decrease in H2O2production. This new mitochondrial functioning allows a better capacity torespond to the energetic demands imposed by the environment but do not influence whole organism metabolism. In conclusion, global mitochondrial functioning has tobe considered to better understand the proximal causes of the energy budget understressful periods.

TI  - Cellular senescence: the good, the bad and the unknown.
LID - 10.1038/s41581-022-00601-z [doi]
AB  - Cellular senescence is a ubiquitous process with roles in tissue remodelling,including wound repair and embryogenesis. However, prolonged senescence can bemaladaptive, leading to cancer development and age-related diseases. Cellularsenescence involves cell-cycle arrest and the release of inflammatory cytokineswith autocrine, paracrine and endocrine activities. Senescent cells also exhibit morphological alterations, including flattened cell bodies, vacuolization andgranularity in the cytoplasm and abnormal organelles. Several biomarkers ofcellular senescence have been identified, including SA-betagal, p16 and p21;however, few markers have high sensitivity and specificity. In addition todriving ageing, senescence of immune and parenchymal cells contributes to thedevelopment of a variety of diseases and metabolic disorders. In the kidney,senescence might have beneficial roles during development and recovery frominjury, but can also contribute to the progression of acute kidney injury andchronic kidney disease. Therapies that target senescence, including senolytic andsenomorphic drugs, stem cell therapies and other interventions, have been shownto extend lifespan and reduce tissue injury in various animal models. Earlyclinical trials confirm that senotherapeutic approaches could be beneficial inhuman disease. However, larger clinical trials are needed to translate theseapproaches to patient care.

AB  - Histological examination of targets in regions of interest in histologicalsections is one of the most frequently used tools in biomedical research.However, it is a technical challenge to secure a multitarget section forinspection of the structure's mutual relationship of targets or a longitudinally filamentous- or tubular-formed tissue section for visitation of the overallmorphological features. We present a method with a specified cutting plane andplace, allowing researchers to cut directly at the multitarget centers accuratelyand quickly. The method is proven to be reliable with high accuracy andreproducibility and a low coefficient of variation, testing on repeat experimentsof three target's position-known models. With this method, we successfullyyielded single sections containing whole intraorbital optical nerves, threeaortic valves, or whole thoracic tracheas in their central positions. Theadjoined custom-made tools used in the study, such as various tissue-specificformulated calibrated trimming and embedding guides, an organ-shaped cavityplaster mold, and a two-time embedding technique for optimal and identicaltrimming or embedding, also bear great potential to become a common supplemental tool for traditional histology and may contribute to the reduction of the labor, and the number of animals needed.

AB  - As a highly infectious epidemic in aquaculture, Pseudomonas plecoglossicidainfection results in high mortality of teleosts and serious economic losses.Host-pathogen interactions shape the outcome of an infection, yet we stillunderstand little about the molecular mechanism of these pathogen-mediatedprocesses. Here, a P. plecoglossicida strain (NZBD9) and Epinephelus coioideswere investigated as a model system to characterize pathogen-induced hostmetabolic remodeling over the course of infection. We present a non-targetedmetabolomics profiling of E. coioides spleens from uninfected E. coioides andthose infected with wild-type and clpV-RNA interference (RNAi) strains. The most significant changes of E. coioides upon infection were associated with aminoacids, lysophospatidylcholines, and unsaturated fatty acids, involvingdisturbances in host nutritional utilization and immune responses.Dihydrosphingosine and fatty acid 16:2 were screened as potential biomarkers for assessing P. plecoglossicida infection. The silencing of the P. plecoglossicidaclpV gene significantly recovered the lipid metabolism of infected E. coioides.This comprehensive metabolomics study provides novel insights into how P.plecoglossicida shape host metabolism to support their survival and replicationand highlights the potential of the virulence gene clpV in the treatment of P.plecoglossicida infection in aquaculture.

TI  - A balanced gut microbiota is essential to maintain health in captive sika deer.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12111-w [doi]
AB  - Certain animals harbor a high proportion of pathogens, particular the zoonoticpathogens, in their gut microbiome but are usually asymptomic; however, theircarried pathogens may seriously threaten the public health. By understanding how the microbiome overcomes the negative effects of pathogens to maintain hosthealth, we can develop novel solutions to control animal-mediated pathogentransmission including identification and application of beneficial microbes.Here, we analyzed the gut microbiota of 10 asymptomic captive sika deerindividuals by full-length 16S rDNA sequencing. Twenty-nine known pathogenscapable of infecting humans were identified, and the accumulated proportions ofthe identified pathogens were highly variable among individuals (2.33 to 39.94%).The relative abundances of several beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillusand Bifidobacterium, were found to be positively correlated with the relativeabundances of accumulated pathogens. Whole-genome metagenomic analysis revealedthat the beneficial- and pathogenic-associated functions, such as genes involved in the synthesis of short chain fatty acids and virulence factors, were alsopositively correlated in the microbiome, indicating that the beneficial andpathogenic functions were maintained at a relatively balanced ratio. Furthermore,the bacteriophages that target the identified pathogens were found to bepositively correlated with the pathogenic content in the microbiome. Severalhigh-quality genomes of beneficial bacteria affiliated with Lactobacillus andBifidobacterium and bacteriophages were recovered from the metagenomic data.Overall, this study provides novel insights into the interplay between beneficialand pathogenic content to ensure maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome, andalso contributes to discovery of novel beneficial microbes and functions thatcontrol pathogens. KEY POINTS: * Certain asymptomic captive sika deer individualsharbor relatively high amounts of zoonotic pathogens. * The beneficial microbesand the beneficial functions are balanced with the pathogenic contents in the gutmicrobiome. * Several high-quality genomes of beneficial bacteria andbacteriophages are recovered by metagenomics.

TI  - Simulations of radioiodine exposure and protective thyroid blocking in a newbiokinetic model of the mother-fetus unit at different pregnancy ages.
LID - 10.1007/s00204-022-03331-0 [doi]
AB  - In the case of nuclear incidents, radioiodine may be released. Afterincorporation, it accumulates in the thyroid and enhances the risk of thyroidaldysfunctions and cancer occurrence by internal irradiation. Pregnant women andchildren are particularly vulnerable. Therefore, thyroidal protection byadministering a large dose of stable (non-radioactive) iodine, blockingradioiodide uptake into the gland, is essential in these subpopulations. However,a quantitative estimation of the protection conferred to the maternal and fetalthyroids in the different stages of pregnancy is difficult. We departed from anestablished biokinetic model for radioiodine in pregnancy using first-orderkinetics. As the uptake of iodide into the thyroid and several other tissues ismediated by a saturable active transport, we integrated an uptake mechanismdescribed by a Michaelis-Menten kinetic. This permits simulating the competition between stable and radioactive iodide at the membrane carrier site, one of theprotective mechanisms. The Wollf-Chaikoff effect, as the other protectivemechanism, was simulated by adding a total net uptake block for iodide into thethyroid, becoming active when the gland is saturated with iodine. The model'svalidity was confirmed by comparing predicted values with results from othermodels and sparse empirical data. According to our model, in the case ofradioiodine exposure without thyroid blocking, the thyroid equivalent dose in thematernal gland increases about 45% within the first weeks of pregnancy to remain in the same range until term. Beginning in the 12th pregnancy week, theequivalent dose in the fetal thyroid disproportionately increases over time andamounts to three times the dose of the maternal gland at term. The maternal andfetal glands' protection increases concomitantly with the amount of stable iodineadministered to the mother simultaneously with acute radioiodine exposure. Thedose-effect curves reflecting the combined thyroidal protection by thecompetition at the membrane carrier site and the Wolff-Chaikoff effect in themother are characterized by a mean effective dose (ED50) of roughly 1.5 mg allover pregnancy. In the case of the fetal thyroid, the mean effective doses forthyroid blocking, taking into account only the competition at the carrier siteare numerically lower than in the mother. Taking into account additionally theWolff-Chaikoff effect, the dose-effect curves for thyroidal protection in thefetus show a shift to the left over time, with a mean effective dose of 12.9 mgin the 12th week of pregnancy decreasing to 0.5 mg at term. In any case,according to our model, the usually recommended dose of 100 mg stable iodinegiven at the time of acute radioiodine exposure confers a very high level ofthyroidal protection to the maternal and fetal glands over pregnancy. For ethicalreasons, the possibilities of experimental studies on thyroid blocking inpregnant women are extremely limited. Furthermore, results from animal studiesare associated with the uncertainties related to the translation of the data tohumans. Thus model-based simulations may be a valuable tool for better insightinto the efficacy of thyroidal protection and improve preparedness planning foruncommon nuclear or radiological emergencies.

TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effects of combined boron and gadolinium neutroncapture therapy in mouse models.
PG  - 13360
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17610-4 [doi]
AB  - While boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) depends primarily on the short flight range of the alpha particles emitted by the boron neutron capture reaction,gadolinium neutron capture therapy (GdNCT) mainly relies on gamma rays and Auger electrons released by the gadolinium neutron capture reaction. BNCT and GdNCT canbe complementary in tumor therapy. Here, we studied the combined effects of BNCT and GdNCT when boron and gadolinium compounds were co-injected, followed bythermal neutron irradiation, and compared these effects with those of the single therapies. In cytotoxicity studies, some additive effects (3243%) were observedwhen CT26 cells were treated with both boron- and gadolinium-encapsulatedPEGylated liposomes (B- and Gd-liposomes) compared to the single treatments. The tumor-suppressive effect was greater when BNCT was followed by GdNCT at aninterval of 10 days rather than vice versa. However, tumor suppression withco-injection of B- and Gd-liposomes into tumor-bearing mice followed by neutronbeam irradiation was comparable to that observed with Gd-liposome-only treatment but lower than B-liposome-only injection. No additive effect was observed withthe combination of BNCT and GdNCT, which could be due to the shielding effect of gadolinium against thermal neutrons because of its overwhelmingly large thermalneutron cross section.

AB  - Animal personality can affect individual fitness and population growth.Personality traits of either parent or parents' combination may facilitatereproduction and offspring survival across species. However, previous studiesfocused mainly on the role of only one sex, and the link between personality and fitness has not been confirmed in primates. We examined this link in both sexesof captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a cooperatively breedingprimate with extensive paternal care. We studied the effects of five personality traits of the parents (Agreeableness, Assertiveness, Conscientiousness,Inquisitiveness, and Patience), including their absolute and directionaldifferences within pairs, on key components of reproductive performance. Weexpected pairs with more similar personality scores to have higher reproductivesuccess as found in other species with long-term pairs and biparental care, butfound no evidence for this hypothesis. Instead, we detected strong effects offemale traits on inter-birth intervals, which were shorter in more agreeablefemales, and fecundity rates, which were higher in more inquisitive females. Maletraits appeared to have only a limited effect on reproductive success of thepair. Our study demonstrates that various aspects of animal personality underpin reproductive performance in captive common marmosets and provides novel insights into the possible ultimate causes of personality in cooperatively breedingspecies.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of innovative retinoic acid (RA) eluting stents with bioabsorbable polymer. Sixty stents divided in tengroups were implanted in the iliac arteries of 30 rabbits. Two polymers ("A",poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and "B", polylactic acid), and three doses ("Low","Medium" and "High") of RA (groups: AL, AM, AH, BL, BM, BH) were used on cobaltchromium stents (Rontis Corporation), one group of bare stent (C), one group (D) of Everolimus eluting stent (Xience-Pro, Abbot Vascular), and two groups ofRontis Everolimus eluting stents coated with polymer A (EA) and B (EB). Treatedarteries were explanted after 4 weeks, processed by methyl methacrylate resin andevaluated by histopathology. None of the implanted stents was related withthrombus formation or extensive inflammation. Image analysis showed limiteddifferences between groups regarding area stenosis (BH, D and EB groups had thelower values). Group BH had lower intimal mean thickness than AH (105.1 vs 75.3mum, p = 0.024). Stents eluting RA, a non-cytotoxic drug, were not related withthrombus formation and had an acceptable degree of stenosis 4 weeks postimplantation. RA dose and type of polymer may play role in the biocompatibilityof the stents.

TI  - Two independent modes of kidney stone suppression achieved by AIM/CD5L and KIM-1.
PG  - 783
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03750-w [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of kidney stones is increasing and its recurrence rate within the first 5 years is over 50%. No treatments that prevent the occurrence/recurrenceof stones have reached the clinic. Here, we show that AIM (also called CD5L)suppresses stone development and improves stone-associated physical damages. The N-terminal domain of AIM associates with calcium oxalate crystals viacharge-based interaction to impede the development of stones, whereas the 2nd andC-terminal domains capture the inflammatory DAMPs to promote their phagocyticremoval. Accordingly, when stones were induced by glyoxylate in mice, recombinantAIM (rAIM) injection dramatically reduced stone development. Expression of injurymolecules and inflammatory cytokines in the kidney and overall renal dysfunction were abrogated by rAIM. Among various negatively charged substances, rAIM wasmost effective in stone prevention due to its high binding affinity to crystals. Furthermore, only AIM was effective in improving the physical complaintsincluding bodyweight-loss through its DAMPs removal effect. We also found thattubular KIM-1 may remove developed stones. Our results could be the basis for thedevelopment of a comprehensive therapy against kidney stone disease.

TI  - Plasticity of body axis polarity in Hydra regeneration under constraints.
PG  - 13368
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17411-9 [doi]
AB  - One of the major events in animal morphogenesis is the emergence of a polar body axis. Here, we combine classic grafting techniques with live imaging to explorethe plasticity of polarity determination during whole body regeneration in Hydra.Composite tissues are made by fusing two rings, excised from separate animals, indifferent configurations that vary in the polarity and original positions of the rings along the body axes of the parent animals. Under frustrating initialconfigurations, body axis polarity that is otherwise stably inherited from theparent animal, can become labile and even be reversed. Importantly, the site ofhead regeneration exhibits a strong bias toward the edges of the tissue, evenwhen this involves polarity reversal. In particular, we observe head formation atan originally aboral tissue edge, which is not compatible with models of Hydraregeneration based only on preexisting morphogen gradients or an injury response.The site of the new head invariably contains an aster-like defect in theorganization of the supra-cellular ectodermal actin fibers. While a defect isneither required nor sufficient for head formation, we show that the defect atthe new head site can arise via different routes, either appearing directlyfollowing excision as the tissue seals at its edge or through de novo defectformation at the fusion site. Altogether, our results show that the emergence of a polar body axis depends on the original polarity and position of the excisedtissues as well as structural factors, suggesting that axis determination is anintegrated process that arises from the dynamic interplay of multiple biochemicaland mechanical processes.

AB  - Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) using cryopreserved non-attenuatedPlasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) offers a unique opportunity toinvestigate naturally acquired immunity (NAI). By analyzing blood samples from 5 malaria-naive European and 20 African adults with lifelong exposure to malaria,before, 5, and 11 days after direct venous inoculation (DVI) with Sanaria(R)PfSPZ Challenge, we assessed the immunological patterns associated with controlof microscopic and submicroscopic parasitemia. All (5/5) European individualsdeveloped parasitemia as defined by thick blood smear (TBS), but 40% (8/20) ofthe African individuals controlled their parasitemia, and therefore remainedthick blood smear-negative (TBS(-) Africans). In the TBS(-) Africans, we observedhigher baseline frequencies of CD4(+) T cells producing interferon-gamma(IFNgamma) that significantly decreased 5 days after PfSPZ DVI. The TBS(-)Africans, which represent individuals with either very strong and rapidblood-stage immunity or with immunity to liver stages, were stratified intosubjects with sub-microscopic parasitemia (TBS(-)PCR(+)) or those with possiblysterilizing immunity (TBS(-)PCR(-)). Higher frequencies ofIFNgamma(+)TNF(+)CD8(+) gammadelta T cells at baseline, which later decreasedwithin five days after PfSPZ DVI, were associated with those who remainedTBS(-)PCR(-). These findings suggest that naturally acquired immunity ischaracterized by different cell types that show varying strengths of malariaparasite control. While the high frequencies of antigen responsiveIFNgamma(+)CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood keep the blood-stage parasites to asub-microscopic level, it is the IFNgamma(+)TNF(+)CD8(+) gammadelta T cells that are associated with either immunity to the liver-stage, or rapid elimination ofblood-stage parasites.

TI  - MicroRNA-101a enhances trabecular bone accrual in male mice.
PG  - 13361
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17579-0 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput microRNA sequencing was performed during differentiation ofMC3T3-E1 osteoblasts to develop working hypotheses for specific microRNAs thatcontrol osteogenesis. The expression data show that miR-101a, which targets themRNAs for the epigenetic enzyme Ezh2 and many other proteins, is highlyupregulated during osteoblast differentiation and robustly expressed in mousecalvaria. Transient elevation of miR-101a suppresses Ezh2 levels, reducestri-methylation of lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3; a heterochromatic markcatalyzed by Ezh2), and accelerates mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Wealso examined skeletal phenotypes of an inducible miR-101a transgene under directcontrol of doxycycline administration. Experimental controls and mir-101aover-expressing mice were exposed to doxycycline in utero and postnatally (up to 8 weeks of age) to maximize penetrance of skeletal phenotypes. Male mice thatover-express miR-101a have increased total body weight and longer femora. MicroCTanalysis indicate that these mice have increased trabecular bone volume fraction,trabecular number and trabecular thickness with reduced trabecular spacing ascompared to controls. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrates a significantreduction in osteoid volume to bone volume and osteoid surface to bone surface.Remarkably, while female mice also exhibit a significant increase in bone length,no significant changes were noted by microCT (trabecular bone parameters) andhistomorphometry (osteoid parameters). Hence, miR-101a upregulation duringosteoblast maturation and the concomitant reduction in Ezh2 mediated H3K27me3levels may contribute to the enhanced trabecular bone parameters in male mice.However, the sex-specific effect of miR-101a indicates that more intricateepigenetic mechanisms mediate physiological control of bone formation andhomeostasis.

TI  - The dynamics of protein localisation to restricted zones within Drosophilamechanosensory cilia.
PG  - 13338
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17189-w [doi]
AB  - The Drosophila chordotonal neuron cilium is the site of mechanosensorytransduction. The cilium has a 9 + 0 axoneme structure and is highlysub-compartmentalised, with proximal and distal zones harbouring different TRPchannels and the proximal zone axoneme also being decorated with axonemal dynein motor complexes. The activity of the dynein complexes is essential formechanotransduction. We investigate the localisation of TRP channels and dyneinmotor complexes during ciliogenesis. Differences in timing of TRP channellocalisation correlate with order of construction of the two ciliary zones.Dynein motor complexes are initially not confined to their target proximal zone, but ectopic complexes beyond the proximal zone are later cleared, perhaps byretrograde transport. Differences in transient distal localisation of outer andinner dynein arm complexes (ODAs and IDAs) are consistent with previoussuggestions from unicellular eukaryotes of differences in processivity duringintraflagellar transport. Stable localisation depends on the targeting of theirdocking proteins in the proximal zone. For ODA, we characterise an ODA dockingcomplex (ODA-DC) that is targeted directly to the proximal zone. Interestingly,the subunit composition of the ODA-DC in chordotonal neuron cilia appears to bedifferent from the predicted ODA-DC in Drosophila sperm.

TI  - A time-series approach to mapping livestock density using household survey data.

AB  - More than one billion people rely on livestock for income, nutrition, and social cohesion, however livestock keeping can facilitate disease transmission andcontribute to climate change. While data on the distribution of livestock havebroad utility across a range of applications, efforts to map the distribution of livestock on a large scale are limited to the Gridded Livestock of the World(GLW) project. We present a complimentary effort to map the distribution ofcattle and pigs in Malawi, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan.In contrast to GLW, which uses dasymmetric modeling applied to census data toproduce time-stratified estimates of livestock counts and spatial density, ourwork uses complex survey data and distinct modeling methods to generate atime-series of livestock distribution, defining livestock density as the ratio ofanimals to humans. In addition to favorable cross-validation results and general agreement with national density estimates derived from external data on national human and livestock populations, our results demonstrate extremely good agreementwith GLW-3 estimates, supporting the validity of both efforts. Our resultsfurthermore offer a high-resolution time series result and employ a definition ofdensity which is particularly well-suited to the study of livestock-originzoonoses.

TI  - Histone H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 form a chromatin platform essential forDNMT3A-dependent DNA methylation in mouse oocytes.
PG  - 4440
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32141-2 [doi]
AB  - Establishment of the DNA methylation landscape of mammalian oocytes, mediated by the DNMT3A-DNMT3L complex, is crucial for reproduction and development. In mouse oocytes, high levels of DNA methylation occur exclusively in thetranscriptionally active regions, with moderate to low levels of methylation inother regions. Histone H3K36me3 mediates the high levels of methylation in thetranscribed regions; however, it is unknown which histone mark guides themethylation in the other regions. Here, we show that, in mouse oocytes, H3K36me2 is highly enriched in the X chromosome and is broadly distributed across allautosomes. Upon H3K36me2 depletion, DNA methylation in moderately methylatedregions is selectively affected, and a methylation pattern unique to the Xchromosome is switched to an autosome-like pattern. Furthermore, we find thatsimultaneous depletion of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 results in globalhypomethylation, comparable to that of DNMT3A depletion. Therefore, the twohistone marks jointly provide the chromatin platform essential for guidingDNMT3A-dependent DNA methylation in mouse oocytes.

AB  - Predicting how reef-building corals will respond to accelerating ocean warmingcaused by climate change requires knowledge of how acclimation and symbiosismodulate heat tolerance in coral early life-history stages. We assayedtranscriptional responses to heat in larvae and juveniles of 11 reproductivecrosses of Acropora tenuis colonies along the Great Barrier Reef. Larvae producedfrom the warmest reef had the highest heat tolerance, although gene expressionresponses to heat were largely conserved by cross identity. Juveniletranscriptional responses were driven strongly by symbiosis - when in symbiosiswith heat-evolved Symbiodiniaceae, hosts displayed intermediate expressionbetween its progenitor Cladocopium and the more stress tolerant Durusdinium,indicating the acquisition of tolerance is a conserved evolutionary process insymbionts. Heat-evolved Symbiodiniaceae facilitated juvenile survival under heat stress, although host transcriptional responses to heat were positivelycorrelated among those hosting different genera of Symbiodiniaceae. Thesefindings reveal the relative contribution of parental environmental history aswell as symbiosis establishment in coral molecular responses to heat in earlylife-history stages.

AB  - The use of metal deposition has been limited to a limited number of applicablesamples due to the increased temperature caused by accelerated electron impact onthe substrate surface. The surfaces of various biological samples have ananoscale structure with specific properties, which have been simulated innumerous studies. However, no examples of nano/microscale reproductions ofbiological surface features have used moulds. In this study, a mould thatimitates the surface shape of a cellular-level biological material wasfabricated, for the first time, and the shape was successfully reproduced usingthe mould. Al thin films were deposited on bovine sperm using magnetronsputtering without thermal denaturation with a cathode operating at a biological temperature. It is difficult to deposit films used as metal coatings onpre-treated biological materials at temperatures below 40 degrees C duringevaporation. The Al thin film was peeled off and used as a mould to reproduce theshape of the sperm with high accuracy using a polymer. The results of this study represent a major innovation in reproducible biomimetic moulding technology,demonstrating biological temperature sputtering. We expect our non-destructivemetal deposition and metal nano-moulding methods for biological samples to be thebasis for the effective utilization of various biological structures.

PG  - 4503
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32216-0 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is exacting an increasing toll worldwide, with newSARS-CoV-2 variants emerging that exhibit higher infectivity rates and that maypartially evade vaccine and antibody immunity. Rapid deployment of non-invasivetherapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variantscould complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on theCOVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting theSARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs).We identify an LNA ASO binding to the 5' leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 thatdisrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy inpreventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration ofthis LNA ASO in the COVID-19 mouse model potently suppresses viral replication(>80-fold) in the lungs of infected mice. We find that the LNA ASO is efficaciousin countering all SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" tested both in vitro and invivo. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promisingtherapeutic approach to reduce or prevent transmission and decrease severity ofCOVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can beflexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences and could be stockpiledfor future coronavirus pandemics.

AB  - Most dairy calves are housed individually in early ontogeny but social housinghas positive effects on calf welfare including an advantage of social buffering, i.e., when negative effects of stress are mitigated through social support ofconspecific. The effects of social buffering has not yet been examined inrelation to disbudding; a painful husbandry procedure commonly performed on youngdairy calves. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pairversus individual housing on calves' behavioral reaction to disbudding. In total 52 female calves were randomly allocated either to individual (n = 16) or pairhousing (n = 36, 18 focal). Calves were hot-iron disbudded with a localanesthetic and their spontaneous behavior in home pens was recorded for 24 h pre-and post-disbudding. Eating forage, ruminating, resting, exploration, play,self-grooming, and pain-related behaviors were quantified during eight 20 minintervals during the 24 h periods pre- as well as post-disbudding. In pair-housed(PAIR) calves social resting, active and passive allo-grooming were additionally recorded. The differences between individually housed (INDI, n = 10) and PAIRcalves (n = 12) were tested by general linear models. The changes in pre- andpost-disbudding behaviors in all calves as well as in social behaviors of PAIRcalves were tested by paired t-test. We found that head shaking (t = - 3.46, P = 0.0024), head rubbing (t = 4.96, P < 0.0001) and self-grooming (t = 2.11, P =0.04) increased in all calves after disbudding. Eating forage increased only inPAIR calves (t = 2.50, P = 0.030) which also resulted in a difference betweentreatments with PAIR calves fed more often than INDI calves (F1,18 = 12.96, P =0.002). Differences in eating forage may be an indication of improved ability of PAIR calves to recover from disbudding. No other significant differences weredetected between treatment groups which might have been caused by our limitedsample. Our results provide the first evidence that housing treatment affectscalves' reactions to disbudding, with possible indication of social buffering.

AB  - Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by chronic inflammation and theprogressive fibrotic replacement of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic tissue. We identify Treg cells as central regulators of the fibroinflammatory reaction by a selective depletion of FOXP3-positive cells in a transgenic mouse model(DEREG-mice) of experimental CP. In Treg-depleted DEREG-mice, the induction of CPresults in a significantly increased stroma deposition, the development ofexocrine insufficiency and significant weight loss starting from day 14 afterdisease onset. In CP, FOXP3(+)CD25(+) Treg cells suppress the type-2 immuneresponse by a repression of GATA3(+) T helper cells (Th2), GATA3(+) innatelymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2) and CD206(+) M2-macrophages. A suspectedpathomechanism behind the fibrotic tissue replacement may involve an observeddysbalance of Activin A expression in macrophages and of its counter regulatorfollistatin. Our study identified Treg cells as key regulators of the type-2immune response and of organ remodeling during CP. The Treg/Th2 axis could be atherapeutic target to prevent fibrosis and preserve functional pancreatic tissue.

PG  - 266
LID - 10.1038/s41392-022-01138-0 [doi]
AB  - Defective interfering genes (DIGs) are short viral genomes and interfere withwild-type viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the new designedSARS-CoV-2 DIG (CD3600) can significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2including Alpha, Delta, Kappa and Omicron variants in human HK-2 cells andinfluenza DIG (PAD4) can significantly inhibit influenza virus replication inhuman A549 cells. One dose of influenza DIGs prophylactically protects 90% micefrom lethal challenge of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and CD3600 inhibits SARS-CoV-2replication in hamster lungs when DIGs are administrated to lungs one day before viral challenge. To further investigate the gene delivery vector in therespiratory tract, a peptidic TAT2-P1&LAH4, which can package genes to form smallspherical nanoparticles with high endosomal escape ability, is demonstrated todramatically increase gene expression in the lung airway. TAT2-P1&LAH4, with the dual-functional TAT2-P1 (gene-delivery and antiviral), can deliver CD3600 tosignificantly inhibit the replication of Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in hamster lungs. This peptide-based nanoparticle system can effectively transfect genes in lungs and deliver DIGs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants and influenza virus invivo, which provides the new insight into the drug delivery system for genetherapy against respiratory viruses.

LID - 10.1002/adbi.202200027 [doi]
AB  - Dysfunction of the aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-dependent glymphatic waste clearancepathway has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of severalneurodegenerative diseases. However, it is difficult to unravel the causativerelationship between glymphatic dysfunction, AQP4 depolarization, proteinaggregation, and inflammation in neurodegeneration using animal models alone.There is currently a clear, unmet need for in vitro models of the brain'swaterscape, and the first steps towards a bona fide "glymphatics-on-a-chip" aretaken in the present study. It is demonstrated that chronic exposure tolipopolysaccharide (LPS), amyloid-beta(1-42) oligomers, and an AQP4 inhibitorimpairs the drainage of fluid and amyloid-beta(1-40) tracer in a gliovascularunit (GVU)-on-a-chip model containing human astrocytes and brain microvascularendothelial cells. The LPS-induced drainage impairment is partially retainedfollowing cell lysis, indicating that neuroinflammation induces parallel changes in cell-dependent and matrisome-dependent fluid transport pathways inGVU-on-a-chip. Additionally, AQP4 depolarization is observed following LPStreatment, suggesting that LPS-induced drainage impairments on-chip may be drivenin part by changes in AQP4-dependent fluid dynamics.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: This study was designed to compare the antitumoreffects of anti-human MUC1 monoclonal antibody with those of anti-human CA199monoclonal antibody coupled with drug-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticleson human pancreatic cancer cell lines and pancreatic cancer-bearing model animalsand to screen more efficient targeting molecules. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Gemcitabine-loaded nanospheres were prepared by emulsion polymerization(GEM-PBCA-NP), and then, anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody was coupled withGEM-PBCA-NP (MUC1-GEM-PBCA-NP), and anti-human CA199 monoclonal antibody wascoupled with GEM-PBCA-NP (CA199-GEM-PBCA-NP), using the chemical crosslinkingmethod. The cell-killing rates were detected using MTT assay. The changes in the tumor cell cycle and apoptosis after treatment were detected using flowcytometry. Then, the subcutaneous planting method was adopted to establish ananimal model of pancreatic cancer: two nanometer microspheres were injected into the body of nude mice via the tail vein; the tumor suppression effect wasdetected after treatment; then, the groups were compared. RESULTS: In vitro, the cell-killing rate of each experimental group was significantly different fromthat of the control group (P < 05). The MUC1-GEM-PBCA-NP group had asignificantly higher cell-killing rate than the other groups (P < 05). Theapoptosis rate of the MUC1-GEM-PBCA-NP treatment group was significantly higherthan that of other groups (P < 05). In vivo, the tumor inhibition rate of theMUC1-GEM-PBCA-NP treatment group was 72.69% +/- 4.29%, which was significantlyhigher than those of other groups (P < 0.05). The tumor inhibition rate of theCA199-GEM-PBCA-NP treatment group was 56.58% +/- 5.11%, which was significantlyhigher than those of other control groups (P < 0.05). At the end of treatment,the average tumor mass of the MUC1-GEM-PBCA-NP treatment group was 433.55 +/-12.49 mg, which was significantly lower than those of other groups (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Compared with CA199-GEM-PBCA-NP, MUC1-GEM-PBCA-NP is more effectivein vitro and in vivo. MUC1 could be a target molecule in treating pancreaticcancer.

TI  - A protective role for Drosophila Filamin in nephrocytes via Yorkie mediatedhypertrophy.
LID - e202101281 [pii]
LID - 10.26508/lsa.202101281 [doi]
AB  - Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells of the kidney glomerulus and are anessential part of the filtration barrier. Because of their position, they areexposed to constant biomechanical forces such as shear stress and hydrostaticpressure. These forces increase during disease, resulting in podocyte injury. It is likely podocytes have adaptative responses to help buffer against deleterious mechanical force and thus reduce injury. However, these responses remain largely unknown. Here, using the Drosophila model, we show the mechanosensor Cheerio(dFilamin) provides a key protective role in nephrocytes. We found expression of an activated mechanosensitive variant of Cheerio rescued filtration function and induced compensatory and hypertrophic growth in nephrocytes depleted of thenephrocyte diaphragm proteins Sns or Duf. Delineating the protective pathwaydownstream of Cheerio we found repression of the Hippo pathway induces nephrocytehypertrophy, whereas Hippo activation reversed the Cheerio-mediated hypertrophy. Furthermore, we find Yorkie was activated upon expression of active Cheerio.Taken together, our data suggest that Cheerio acts via the Hippo pathway toinduce hypertrophic growth, as a protective response in abnormal nephrocytes.

TI  - Questionable Research Practices, Low Statistical Power, and Other Obstacles toReplicability: Why Preclinical Neuroscience Research Would Benefit fromRegistered Reports.
LID - ENEURO.0017-22.2022 [pii]
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0017-22.2022 [doi]
AB  - Replicability, the degree to which a previous scientific finding can be repeated in a distinct set of data, has been considered an integral component ofinstitutionalized scientific practice since its inception several hundred yearsago. In the past decade, large-scale replication studies have demonstrated thatreplicability is far from favorable, across multiple scientific fields. Here, Ievaluate this literature and describe contributing factors including theprevalence of questionable research practices (QRPs), misunderstanding ofp-values, and low statistical power. I subsequently discuss how these issuesmanifest specifically in preclinical neuroscience research. I conclude that theseproblems are multifaceted and difficult to solve, relying on the actions of earlyand late career researchers, funding sources, academic publishers, and others. I assert that any viable solution to the problem of substandard replicability must include changing academic incentives, with adoption of registered reports beingthe most immediately impactful and pragmatic strategy. For animal research inparticular, comprehensive reporting guidelines that document potential sources ofsensitivity for experimental outcomes is an essential addition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of vegetable oils andanimal oils on the reproductive system of male rats. METHODS: This study was arandom and observational study conducted on 36 male rats with the age of 6 weeks weighing 200 +/- 20 grams. Different groups were fed by sesame oil, suet oil,rapeseed oil and animal butter. The control group was fed by standard food usednormally to feed animals in the laboratories. At the end of six weeks,testosterone level changes and weight changes were compared among differentgroups. Data were analyzed by SPSS-IBM version 16. RESULT: Weight changes amonggroups did not show a dramatic statistical difference (P = .571 > 0.005). Averageweight in control group was 202 and about the male rats fed by 10% of animalbutter and by sesame oil were 206.5 and 99, respectively. Weight changes amonggroups were significant (P value = 0.005 > 0.0004). The average testosteronelevel in the control group was 2.4. This value in the different groups fed by 10%oils, the maximum was 12.2 and the minimum was 1.35 assigned to animal butter andrapeseed oil, respectively. So we concluded that using 10% of different oilscauses an increase in testosterone level (P value = 0.001 > 0.05). The maximumtestosterone level was 3.6 in the rapeseed 20% group and lowest 0.45 in thesesame 20% group. CONCLUSION: We found that animal oil-containing diet has nosignificant harmful effect on male rat reproductive system in comparison withplant oils.

TI  - Source Apportionment, Hydrodynamic Influence, and Environmental Stress ofPharmaceuticals in a Microtidal Estuary with Multiple Outlets in South China.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02384 [doi]
AB  - Pharmaceutical residues in the environment are of great concern as ubiquitousemerging contaminants. This study investigated the presence of 40 pharmaceuticalsin water and sediment of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in the wet season of 2020.Among psychiatric drugs, only diazepam was found in water samples while six ofthem were detected in the sediment. The Sigmaantibiotics levels ranged from 6.18 to 35.9 ng/L and 2.63 to 140 ng/g dry weight in water and sediment samples,respectively. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were found well settling in the outlet sediment, while sulfonamides could be released from disturbed sedimentunder stronger tidal wash-out conditions. After entering the marine waters,pharmaceuticals tended to deposit at the PRE mouth by the influence of the plume bulge and onshore invasion of deep shelf waters. Low ecological risks to theaquatic organisms and of causing antimicrobial resistance were identified.Likewise, hydrological modeling results revealed insignificant risks:erythromycin-H2O and sulfamethoxazole discharged through the outlets constituted 30.8% and 6.74% of their environmental capacity, respectively. Sourceapportionment revealed that pharmaceutical discharges through the Humen and Yamenoutlets were predominantly of animal origin. Overall, our findings providestrategic insights on environmental regulations to further minimize theenvironmental stress of pharmaceuticals in the PRE.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a common anaerobic foodborne pathogen known to produce>20 toxins. In nature, this bacterium has 7 different toxinotypes (A-G) based on the presence of its 6 main toxins. The present study examined the occurrence ofdifferent toxinotypes of this bacterium in the ichthyofauna and aquaticenvironments of Kashmir Himalayan lakes, India. A total of 510 samples (210water; 150 each of common carp and snow trout) were collected from 3 differentlacustrine habitats (Dal, Anchar and Nigeen Lakes) of the region. By performing16S rRNA PCR test, it was observed that all 210 water samples and 80 (26.66%) of 300 fish samples tested for this specific bacterial species were positive. Thenby using multiplex-PCR targeting six virulence genes of C. perfringens, it wasconfirmed that all the 290 isolates from water and fish samples were positive forToxinotype A, as only cpa toxin gene was amplified. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplified gene and its amino-acid sequences revealed 95%-98% homology withanalogous sequences of this bacterial strain reported from China, Egypt andIndia. The study documents the existence of C. perfringens toxinotype A in theichthyofauna of Kashmiri Himalayan lakes, entailing that fish can likely act astransmission medium for C. perfringens food poisoning to humans via food.

AB  - Bovine mastitis is a disease that is widespread in dairy cows worldwide, and its impact is significant due to economic losses at all levels of the dairy valuechain. For a long time, antibiotics have been the main tool for curing mastitis, however the cure rate is not very high, and sometime side effects may occur.Therefore, an in-depth understanding of mastitis and effective solutions areurgently needed to resolve the problem that in what way to prevent and treatmastitis in order to protect the profitability of dairy farms. The importance of diet in the regulation of health are not novel. Dietary control of the intestinalflora provides a promising approach to prevent or treat certain deadly diseases. Ample amount of studies has been conducted on the role of short-chain fatty acids(SCFAs) in the maintenance of health. SCFAs are the type of dietary substancethat has the ability to restore blood-milk barrier permeability, inhibit thedevelopment of mammary inflammation, and are also effective epigenomic modifiers with histone deacetylases inhibitory activity. To date, the detailed mechanism ofaction of SCFAs in treating mastitis is unclear, but preliminary evidences areemerging. To assess the effectiveness of this recommendation, we examined theoverall mammary gland health knowledge related to SCFAs by scrutinizing theirpotential role and evaluating its compatibility with the immunobiology of mammarygland inflammation. We then considered preliminary in vivo and in vitroexperiments and analyzed the literature on the subject. Here, we outline theproduction of SCFAs and its protective effect on the mammary gland, withparticular emphasis on their relevance to mastitis. In addition, we alsodiscussed the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for mammary gland inflammation.Expectantly, this theory will provide new perception for the treatment ofmastitis and other infectious diseases.

AB  - Acute ammonia toxicity suppresses the immune function and enhances theinflammatory pathways in Nile tilapia. The aim of this study was to compare theeffect of Bacillus strains probiotic mixture (BS) or Yucca shidigera liquidextract (YSE) alone or their combination in water treatment and in relivingtoxicity of an acute ammonia exposure in Nile tilapia through the assessment offish immune response, inflammatory pathway, oxidative stress response withrespect to the histopathological changes, gene expression, enzymes levels andphagocytosis. Five groups were used; the 1st and 2nd groups fed the basal diet;the 3rd group fed basal diet with BS in water, 4th group fed basal diet andsupplemented with YSE in water and 5th group received a combination of BS andYSE. After two weeks of treatments, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and the 5th groups wereexposed to acute ammonia challenge for 72h. Fish exposed to ammonia displayedsignificant decreases in RBCs, Hb, PCV, WBCs, phagocytic activity (PA) and index (PI), lysozyme activities and serum antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase(GPX) and catalase (CAT)). Also, a significant increase in Malondialdehyde (MDA),degenerative changes in the gills, hepatopancrease and spleen associated with an elevated un-ionized ammonia level. A significant restoration of the hematologicalparameters was observed with the use of BS, YSE or their combination.Additionally, they improved the innate immunity, antioxidant responses, andhistopathological changes. At transcriptomic level, ammonia toxicitysignificantly lowered the mRNA transcription levels of Nuclear erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), Heme oxygenase 1(HO-1) and Heat shock proteins (HSP70). While nuclear factor kappa beta (NFsmall ka, Cyrillicbeta), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin 1beta(IL-1beta), and Interleukin 8 (IL8), transcription levels were increased.Interestingly, BS and YSE and their combination significantly increased theexpression of these genes with the highest levels reported with BS and YSEcombination. We observed that, the most pronounced restoration of some important inflammatory and immune related genes close to the control level was observedwhen BS-YSE mix was used. Furthermore, a restored water pH, and a maintainedammonia level to the control level were observed in this group. Otherwise, equal effects for the three treatments were observed on the assessed parameters. Werecommend the used of BS-YSE mix for water ammonia treatment and relievingammonia toxicity in fish.

AB  - A 70-day feeding trial was conducted to ascertain the effects of threonine onimmune response of juvenile oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense). Six isonitrogen and isolipidic feeds were formulated according to levels of dietarythreonine (0.35%, 0.79%, 1.18%, 1.67%, 2.08% and 2.48% respectively). Thejuvenile prawns were divided into six groups with four replicates, and stockedinto 24 tanks with 50 prawns per tank (initial weight 0.20+/-0.02g). The results showed a significant increasing trend of final body weight, specific growth rate,protein efficiency ratio, and weight gain rate when threonine levels increased to1.67% (P<0.05). However, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and whole-body lipidcomposition significantly decreased as threonine levels in the feed increased up to 1.67% (P<0.05). Moreover, haemolymph N-urea content was significantly lowestat 1.67% threonine level (P<0.05), whereas glucose was highest at 0.79% followed by 1.67% of threonine levels in the feeds. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)enzyme activities were significantly decreased by an imbalance (except 1.67%) of threonine in the feed (P<0.05). Activities of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and albumen (ALB) were not significantly affected by threonine in the feed (P>0.05). Excessive dietary threonine level (2.48%) significantly activated haemolymphcatalase (CAT) activity (P<0.05), whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) content wassignificantly affected by deficient (0.35% and 0.79%) dietary threonine levels(P<0.05). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and haemolymphcomplement component 4 (C4) content were significantly decreased by deficientlevels of threonine in the feed (P<0.05). Excess threonine concentrationsignificantly down-regulated Toll, Dorsal, Relish, and heat shock protein 60(Hsp60) gene expressions in the hepatopancreas of M. nipponense (P<0.05), whileall genes were significantly up-regulated by the optimal (1.67%) threonine level (P<0.05). The threonine level at which maximum specific growth rate of M.nipponense occurred was estimated by second degree polynomial regression analysisas 1.65% of threonine level, equivalent to 4.44% dry weight bases of protein inthe feed.

AB  - Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) regulates cellular life processes,including defense responses against infection by a variety of viral pathogens, bybinding to target proteins. At present, various fish ISG15s have been identified,but the biological function of ISG15 in snakehead fish is still unclear. In this study, total RNA was extracted from snakehead fish cell line E11, ds cDNA wassynthesized and purified using SMART technology, and the resulting cDNA librarywas screened by co-transforming yeast cells. The library titer was4.28x10(9)CFU/mL. Using snakehead ISG15 as the bait protein, the recombinant baitvector pGBKT7-ISG15 was constructed and transformed into the yeast strainY2HGold. The toxicity and self-activation activity of the bait vector weredetected on the deficient medium, and the prey proteins interacting with ISG15were screened. In total, 19 interacting proteins of ISG15 were identified,including mitotic checkpoint protein BUB3, hypothetical protein SnRVgp6,elongation factor 1-beta, 60S ribosomal protein L9, dual specificity proteinphosphatase 5-like, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit I andferritin. A yeast spotting assay further probed the interaction between ISG15 andDUSP5. These results increase our understanding of the interaction network ofsnakehead ISG15 and will aid in exploring the underlying mechanisms of snakehead ISG15 functions in the future.

AB  - Exosomes are small membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by various types of cells.In mammals, a wide range of physiological and pathological functions have beenconfirmed and attributed to EVs carrying a variety of molecular cargoes,including miRNAs. However, studies on the biological functions and relatedmolecular mechanisms of serum exosomes isolated from teleost fish are limited.Indeed, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of serum exosomes onimmune responses and inflammatory processes are unknown. Chinese tongue sole(Cynoglossus semilaevis) is an economically important species used widely inindustrial aquaculture. Vibrio harveyi, a common bacterial pathogen that infects C. semilaevis and some other fish, causes excessive inflammatory reactions, whichare characterized by skin ulceration. Here, we isolated serum-derived exosomesfrom C. semilaevis and investigated their effects on inflammatory processesfollowing V. harveyi infection. We found that compared with uninfected fish,exosome abundance in infected fish blood increased with bacterial infection time,while expression of TNF-alpha increased, and that of IL-10 decreased,significantly. Moreover, artificial infection studies demonstrated that injectionof serum exosomes isolated from infected fish increased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8, which is consistent with the increase in proinflammatorycytokines induced by V. harveyi infection. To further investigate the mechanisms by which exosomes increase proinflammatory cytokine production, we performedmiRNA expression profiling and found that 26 differentially expressed miRNAs wereassociated with bacterial infection and immune responses; of these, miR-133-3pwas considerably more abundant in serum exosomes from infected fish.Bioinformatics analysis suggested that miR-133-3p inhibits NF-kappaB signalingpathways by targeting PP2A and affecting cytokine release. We also found thatmiR-133-3p increased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 in fish blood andkidney, whereas an miR-133-3p inhibitor showed the opposite results. Thus, thedata suggest that serum exosomes participate in innate immunity in teleost fishby promoting inflammatory responses to bacterial infection. Exosome-mediatedtransfer of miR-133-3p increases expression of proinflammatory cytokines in C.semilaevis, resulting in excessive inflammatory responses during V. harveyiinfection. These data may lead to development of methods and strategies thatcontrol skin ulceration in Chinese tongue sole.

AB  - Tripartite motif containing 37 (TRIM37) was reported to function as a tumorpromoter in the development of various cancers. However, the biological role ofTRIM37 in ovarian cancer (OC) was still unclear. Expressions of TRIM37 and HUWE1 were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting in OC cells. Cell proliferation wasevaluated by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion capabilities were examined by wound healing and transwell assay. Flow cytometryand western blotting were performed to measure cell apoptosis. Wnt/beta-cateninpathway and the expression of c-Myc were identified by qRT-PCR and westernblotting. The binding of TRIM37 and HUWE1 was predicted by STRING database andverified by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, a xenograft mouse model wasestablished to evaluate the effects of TRIM37 and HUWE1 on tumor growth and c-MYCexpression in vivo. The present study revealed that TRIM37 expression wasupregulated in OC tissues and cells. TRIM37 silencing inhibited OC cell migrationand invasion, promoted OC cell apoptosis, and blocked Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, as well as suppressing c-MYC protein expression. Mechanistic studiessuggested that TRIM37 binds to HUWE1. HUWE1 was upregulated in OC cells andTRIM37 promoted the c-MYC expression through targeting HUWE1. Animal experiments showed that TRIM37 silencing significantly repressed the tumor growth and c-MYCprotein level, but HUWE1 overexpression reversed the effects of TRIM37 knockdown on mice with OC. Our findings revealed that TRIM37 accelerated the progression ofOC and promoted c-MYC expression by binding to HUWE1, which provides therapeutic targetsfor OC treatment.

AB  - Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most extensively utilizedplasticizers in the plastic manufacturing process. It is widely used in variousfields due to its low cost and excellent effect. Although there is evidence that DEHP is harmful to animal and human health, DEHP-induced gill toxicity in aquaticorganisms is inconclusive, and its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here,we investigated the effects of DEHP acute exposure on crucian carp gills atenvironmentally relevant concentrations of 20, 100, and 500mug/L. Multi-omicsprofiling and biochemical assays were employed to characterize the potentialtoxicological mechanisms. The results showed that acute exposure to 100 and500mug/L of DEHP leads to oxidative stress in gills, as evidenced byoverproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased antioxidant enzymeactivity, and the transformation of glutathione from reduced to oxidized form,resulting in lipid peroxidation. Integrative analysis of transcriptomics andmetabolomics indicated that increased purine metabolism was the potential source of increased ROS. Moreover, lipid metabolism disorder, including arachidonic acidmetabolism, induces inflammation. Further, DEHP causes the imbalance of the CYPenzyme system in the gill, and DEHP-induced gill toxicity in crucian carp wasassociated with interference with CYP450 homeostasis. Taken together, this study broadens the molecular understanding of the DEHP-induced gill toxicity in aquaticorganisms and provides novel perspectives for assessing the effects of DEHP ontarget and non-target aquatic organisms in the environment.

AB  - Although COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, multiple pathogenic coronavirusspecies exist, urging on development of multispecies coronavirus vaccines. Herewe develop prototype lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccine candidates againstSARS-CoV-2 Delta, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, and we test how multiplexing LNP-mRNAs can induce effective immune responses in animal models. Triplex and duplexLNP-mRNA vaccinations induce antigen-specific antibody responses againstSARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles theglobal systemic immune repertoires and respective transcriptome signatures ofvaccinated animals, revealing a systemic increase in activated B cells anddifferential gene expression across major adaptive immune cells. Sequentialvaccination shows potent antibody responses against all three species,significantly stronger than simultaneous vaccination in mixture. These datademonstrate the feasibility, antibody responses, and single-cell immune profiles of multispecies coronavirus vaccination. The direct comparison betweensimultaneous and sequential vaccination offers insights into optimization ofvaccination schedules to provide broad and potent antibody immunity against threemajor pathogenic coronavirus species.

TI  - A review on bioceramics scaffolds for bone defect in different types of animalmodels: HA and beta -TCP.
LID - 10.1088/2057-1976/ac867f [doi]
AB  - Increased life expectancy has led to an increase in the use of bone substitutesin numerous nations, with over two million bone-grafting surgeries performedworldwide each year. A bone defect can be caused by trauma, infections, andtissue resections which can self-heal due to the osteoconductive nature of thenative extracellular matrix components. However, natural self-healing istime-consuming, and new bone regeneration is slow, especially for large bonedefects. It also remains a clinical challenge for surgeons to have a suitablebone substitute. To date, there are numerous potential treatments for bonegrafting, including gold-standard autografts, allograft implantation, xenografts,or bone graft substitutes. Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA) arethe most extensively used and studied bone substitutes due to their similarchemical composition to bone. The scaffolds should be testedin vivoandinvitrousing suitable animal models to ensure that the biomaterials workeffectively as implants. Hence, this article aims to familiarize readers with themost frequently used animal models for biomaterials testing and highlight theavailable literature for in vivo studies using small and large animal models.This review summarizes the bio ceramic materials, particularly HA and beta-TCPscaffolds, for bone defects in small and large animal models. Besides, the designconsiderations for the pre-clinical animal model selection for bone defectimplants are emphasized and presented.

AB  - Hepatocytes have important roles in liver iron homeostasis, abnormalities inwhich are tightly associated with liver steatosis and fibrosis. Here, we showthat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) arecharacterized by iron-deficient hepatocytes and iron overload in hepatic stellatecells (HSCs). Iron deficiency enhances hepatocyte lipogenesis and insulinresistance through HIF2alpha-ATF4 signaling. Elevated secretion ofiron-containing hepatocyte extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are normallycleared by Kupffer cells, accounts for hepatocyte iron deficiency and HSC ironoverload in NAFLD/NASH livers. Iron accumulation results in overproduction ofreactive oxygen species that promote HSC fibrogenic activation. Conversely,blocking hepatocyte EV secretion or depleting EV iron cargo restores liver ironhomeostasis, concomitant with mitigation of NAFLD/NASH-associated liver steatosisand fibrosis. Taken together, these studies show that iron distribution disorderscontribute to the development of liver metabolic diseases.

AB  - The molecular interactions that regulate chronic inflammation underlyingmetabolic disease remain largely unknown. Since the CD24-Siglec interactionregulates inflammatory response to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), we have generated multiple mouse strains with single or combined mutations ofCd24 or Siglec genes to explore the role of the CD24-Siglec interaction inmetaflammation and metabolic disorder. Here, we report that the CD24-Siglec-Eaxis, but not other Siglecs, is a key suppressor of obesity-related metabolicdysfunction. Inactivation of the CD24-Siglec-E pathway exacerbates, while CD24Fc treatment alleviates, diet-induced metabolic disorders, including obesity,dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Mechanistically, sialylation-dependent recognition of CD24 by Siglec-E inducesSHP-1 recruitment and represses metaflammation to protect against metabolicsyndrome. A first-in-human study of CD24Fc (NCT02650895) supports thesignificance of this pathway in human lipid metabolism and inflammation. Thesefindings identify the CD24-Siglec-E axis as an innate immune checkpoint againstmetaflammation and metabolic disorder and suggest a promising therapeutic target for metabolic disease.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate effects of niacin on the intestinal epithelialbarrier, intestinal immunity, and microbial community in weaned pigletschallenged by Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). In this study, fifteen weanedpiglets were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, (1) control group, normal diet; (2) PDCoV group, infected with 1 x 10(7) TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-HN-17 strain by oral administration; (3) NA + PDCoV group, infected with 1 x 10(7) TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-HN-17 strain by oral administration following administration of 40 mgof niacin for three days. The results showed that PDCoV infection induceddiarrhea and other clinical symptoms with intestinal villi shedding and atrophyin weaned piglets. Niacin alleviated the symptoms of diarrhea and intestinaldamage of PDCoV-infected weaned piglets. Additionally, PDCoV increased (P < 0.05)the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins [zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) andClaudin] and antimicrobial peptides [porcine beta defensin 1 (pBD1), pBD2,proline-arginine rich 39-amino acid peptide (PR39) and protegrin 1-5 (PG1-5) inthe jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets, while niacin increased (P < 0.05) theexpression of PG1-5 compared with PDCoV. PDCoV increased (P < 0.05) the contents of serum interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8 and intestinal IL-8, and up-regulatedthe mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6,IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18 in ileum of weaned piglets compared with control.However, niacin decreased (P < 0.05) the contents of serum IL-1beta, IL-6 andintestinal IL-10 and IL-8, and also reduced (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression ofileal TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IL-12 in the PDCoV-infected piglets. Compared withcontrol, PDCoV up-regulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of key genes relatedto innate immune and antiviral molecules [toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), NOD1,NOD2, DDX58, CCL2, STAT2, Mx1, IFN-gamma, and protein kinase R (PKR) in the ileumof weaned piglets. Niacin decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of NOD1, NOD2,STAT2, IFN-gamma, and PKR in PDCoV-infected weaned piglets. Moreover, the mRNAexpression of IL-6 decreased (P < 0.05) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase(OAS), IFN-alpha, and PKR increased (P < 0.05) in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cellstreated with niacin in vitro. Furthermore, niacin decreased (P < 0.05) theelevation of protein expression including inducible NOS (iNOS), nuclearfactor-kappaB (NF-kappaB p65), inhibitor kappa B (IKKbeta), histone deacetylase[Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) and phosphorylation ofhistone H3 at serine s10 (pH3s10) in the ileum of PDCoV-infected piglets, andincreased (P < 0.05) the expression of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR109A).PDCoV disrupted the composition and structure of microflora in the colon ofweaned piglets, and reduced the relative abundance of the beneficial bacteriaSpirobacterium, but niacin could improve the intestinal microbial flora of thePDCoV-infected piglets associated with increasing the relative abundance ofLactobacillus. Overall, niacin could alleviate diarrhea, intestinal barrierdamages, intestinal immune response and colonic microflora disfunction inPDCoV-infected weaned piglets.

AB  - Outbreaks of cattle lungworm disease (Dictyocaulus viviparus) are explosive andcostly. The unpredictability of the disease often encourages farmers to applyblanket anthelmintic treatments to the herd, which impede the acquisition ofimmunity, increase the risk of drug resistance, and interfere with efforts toreduce anthelmintic use against ubiquitous gastrointestinal nematodes. Improving our understanding of the factors which lead to a high risk of infection withlungworm, (including climatic pressure), would support a more targetedmanagement. We present GLOWORM-FL-DV, the first mathematical model of thefree-living stages of D. viviparus. The ecology of D. viviparus is uniquecompared with other strongylid nematodes due to its relationship with Pilobilusspp. fungi, which enhance the transmission potential. The role of the fungi wastherefore incorporated into the model framework, informed by laboratoryobservations of Pilobolus spp. development and sporulation. The thermal niche of D. viviparus was characterised based on published and laboratory observations.Mortality of parasitic larvae increased significantly below 0(o)C, and larvaldevelopment occurred above 1.4(o)C, whereas the estimated minimum temperature formigration via Pilobolus spp. was 8.8(o)C. Model predictions were compared withantibody levels in bulk milk tank samples collected at two-weekly intervals from eight dairy herds across Great Britain over two grazing seasons. The modelpredicted high levels of larval abundance on pasture 46 days (38-52 days) before a rise in antibody levels and 22-26 days before the onset of clinical signs. The model assesses the impact of climate and weather on lungworm larval availability at pasture and provides a framework for the development of a risk forecastingsystem. This could help to focus vigilance for clinical signs at high-risk times and facilitate the targeted use of anthelmintics to prevent outbreaks, in supportof sustainable parasite control.

AB  - Targeting the vital kinase protein TBK1, optineurin (OPTN) performs as asuppressor involved in controlling RNA virus-induced interferon beta (IFN-beta)production. It has been determined that OPTN is altered by phosphorylation andubiquitination, which are crucial for the generation of IFN-beta and mitophagy.In this study, endogenous OPTN was first discovered in human cells at a molecularmass of about 115 kD. The SUMOylation band was verified to be the highermolecular mass band of the OPTN. Additionally, the OPTN SUMOylation band was seenin cells from several species, including mouse, rabbit, bovine, porcine, etc.,but not in cells from avian animals (chicken and duck). This finding suggeststhat OPTN SUMOylation is well conserved in mammals but not in avian animals.Additionally, it was determined that some lysine residues in the human OPTN hadSUMOylation sites that followed the consensus motif. LPS, VSV infection,starvation, and RNA virus infection are a few of the stimuli that encourageendogens OPTN SUMOylation. OPTN SUMOylation is essential for OPTN biologicalactivity, as evidenced by the stark differences in the cellular distribution ofmutant OPTN SUMOylation sites from wild type (WT) OPTN. Additionally, wediscovered that non-SUMOylated OPTN lost its ability to block both IFN-betaproduction. Our findings offer a preliminary understanding of how OPTNSUMOylation regulates IFN-beta production.

TI  - Viability study of clinical bacterial strains by capillary electrophoresis andflow cytometry approaches.
LID - 10.1002/elps.202200096 [doi]
AB  - One of the challenges medicine faces is the constantly growing resistance ofpathogens to various classes of antibiotics. In this study, we investigated theuse of capillary electrophoresis (CE) to characterize and assess thephysiological states of three clinical bacterial strains - Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA), and Escherichiacoli ESbetaL - exposed to different antibiotics. All chosen bacteria are theleading causes of healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired invasive infectionsin adults. In the first part of the research, it was determined the optimalincubation time of the tested strains with antibiotics, represented as an optimaltime 24 hours. In the second part, we have compared two approaches: flowcytometry (FC) as a standard method and CE as a proposed alternative approach.The viability of clinical strains treated with different class antibioticscalculated in CE measurements, was strongly correlated (>0.83 for MSSA, >0.92 forESbetaL and MRSA) with the viability obtained on the basis of FC measurements. Asa result, CE has a chance to become a modern diagnostic method used in clinicalpractice. The CE cut-off was found to be 50%; above this value, the strain shows resistance to the action of the antibiotic. This article is protected bycopyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Discovery and engineering of an anti-TREM2 antibody to promote amyloid plaqueclearance by microglia in 5XFAD mice.

AB  - Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) plays a crucial role in regulating microglial functions and removal of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer'sdisease (AD). However, therapeutics based on this knowledge have not beendeveloped due to the low antibody brain penetration and weak TREM2 activation. Inthis study, we engineered a TREM2 bispecific antibody to potently activate TREM2 and enter the brain. To boost TREM2 activation, we increased the valency ofbivalent anti-TREM2 Ab2 IgG to tetra-variable domain immunoglobulin (TVD-Ig),thus improving the EC50 of amyloid-beta oligomer (oAbeta)-lipid microglialphagocytosis by more than 100-fold. Ab2 TVD-Ig treatment also augmented bothmicroglia migration toward oAbeta and microglia survival by 100-fold over thebivalent IgG antibody. By targeting the transferrin receptor (TfR), thebrain-penetrating Ab2 TVD-Ig/alphaTfR bispecific antibody realized broad brainparenchyma distribution with a 10-fold increase in brain antibody concentration. Ab2 TVD-Ig/alphaTfR treatment of 5-month-old 5XFAD mice significantly boostedmicroglia-plaque interactions and enhanced amyloid plaque phagocytosis bymicroglia. Thus, potent TREM2 activation by a multivalent agonist antibodycoupled with TfR-mediated brain entry can boost microglia clearance of amyloidplaques, which suggests the antibody has potential as an AD treatment.List ofabbreviations AD: Alzheimer's disease; Ab: antibody; APOE: apolipoprotein E;Abeta: amyloid beta; BBB: blood-brain barrier; BLI: bio-layer interferometry;CNS: central nervous system; CSF: colony-stimulating factor; CytoD: cytochalasin d; DAM: microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases; DAP12:DNAX-activation protein 12; TVD-Ig: tetra-variable domain immunoglobulin; ECD:extracellular domain; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunoassay; ESC: embryonic stem cell;hMGLs: human embryonic stem cell-derived microglia-like lines; IBA1: ionizedcalcium-binding adaptor molecule 1; ITAM: immunoreceptor tyrosine-basedactivation motif; KiH: knob-into-hole; NFAT: nuclear factor of activated t-cells;PC: phosphatidylcholine; PK: pharmacokinetics; PS: phosphatidylserine; pSYK:phosphorylated spleen tyrosine kinase; scFv: single-chain variable fragment; SEC:size-exclusion chromatography; sTREM2: soluble triggering receptor expressed onmyeloid cells 2; SYK: spleen tyrosine kinase; TfR: transferrin receptor; TREM2:triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2.

AB  - The probiotic bacterial strain Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been shown toalleviate symptoms of intestinal inflammation in human clinical trials and animalfeed supplementation studies. To identify factors involved in immunomodulatoryeffects on host cells, E. faecium SF68 and other commensal and clinicalEnterococcus isolates were screened using intestinal epithelial cell linesharboring reporter fusions for NF-kappaB and JNK(AP-1) activation to determinethe responses of host cell innate immune signaling pathways when challenged with bacterial protein and cell components. Cell-free, whole-cell lysates of E.faecium SF68 showed a reversible, inhibitory effect on both NF-kappaB andJNK(AP-1) signaling pathway activation in intestinal epithelial cells andabrogated the response to bacterial and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.The inhibitory effect was species-specific, and was not observed for E. avium, E.gallinarum, or E. casseliflavus. Screening of protein fractions of E. faeciumSF68 lysates yielded an active fraction containing a prominent protein identifiedas arginine deiminase (ADI). The E. faecium SF68 arcA gene encoding argininedeiminase was cloned and introduced into E. avium where it conferred the sameNF-kappaB inhibitory effects on intestinal epithelial cells as seen for E.faecium SF68. Our results indicate that the arginine deiminase of E. faecium SF68is responsible for inhibition of host cell NF-kappaB and JNK(AP-1) pathwayactivation, and is likely to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory andimmunomodulatory effects observed in prior clinical human and animal trials. The implications for the use of this probiotic strain for preventive and therapeutic purposes are discussed.

TI  - Technical note: A Nose Ring Sensor System to Monitor Dairy Cow Cardiovascular andRespiratory Metrics.
LID - skac240 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jas/skac240 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring cardiovascular and respiratory measurements corresponds to theprecision livestock farming (PLF) objective to continuously monitor and assessdairy cows' welfare and health. Changes in heart rate, breathing rate, and oxygensaturation (SpO2) are valuable metrics in human and veterinary medicine to assessstress, pain, illness, and detect critical conditions. The common way to measure heart rate is either manually or with a stethoscope. Under research conditions,heart rate is usually measured with a sports watch chest belt. Breathing rate is obtained by counting the cow's flank movements which is a time-consuming andlabor-intensive method that requires training and is prone to human error. Nodevices are available on the market that enable practical and easy pulse oximetryin farm animals. This study presents a wireless nose ring sensor system (NoRS)composed of photoplethysmography and thermal sensors that attach to the nostrils of four Holstein dairy cows. The NoRS's thermocouple measured the cow's nasalcavity air temperature; an optic sensor measured the IR (660 nm) and RED (660 nm)signals reflected from the cow's nasal septum. Breathing was calculated from the thermocouple signal's center frequency with a Fast Fourier Transformation, or thesignal peak count (i.e., oscillations). The breathing rate was compared tobreathing observed by concurrently counting the flank movements. Heart rate andSpO2 were measured by integrated pulse oximetry and heart rate monitor module(MAX30101 TinyCircuit) assembled on the NoRS circuit. Heart rate was alsomeasured with FFT and by counting the number of peaks from the optic sensor's rawIR and RED signals. These measures were compared to an off the shelf hand-heldpulse oximeter's heart rate and SpO2 readings during the same time. Thecomparisons revealed highly significant correlations for the heart rate readings where the strength of the correlation was sensitive to the method. Thecorrelation between breathing rate and the veterinarian's visual observations waslow, albeit significant. Thus inhale-exhale cycle counting constitutes a moreprecise approach than flank movement counts. The hand-held device's 96% SpO2 iscompatible with near-saturation values expected in healthy cows. The mean NoRSSpO2 reading was 3% less. After further piloting under field conditions, the NoRSwill require no animal restraining to automatically and continuously record cows'breathing rate, heart rate, and SpO2.

TI  - Altiratinib blocks Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum development byselectively targeting a spliceosome kinase.
PG  - eabn3231
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abn3231 [doi]
AB  - The Apicomplexa comprise a large phylum of single-celled, obligate intracellular protozoa that include Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium, and Cryptosporidium spp.,which infect humans and animals and cause severe parasitic diseases. Availabletherapeutics against these diseases are limited by suboptimal efficacy andfrequent side effects, as well as the emergence and spread of resistance. We use a drug repurposing strategy and identify altiratinib, a compound originallydeveloped to treat glioblastoma, as a promising drug candidate with broadspectrum activity against apicomplexans. Altiratinib is parasiticidal and blocks the development of intracellular zoites in the nanomolar range and with a highselectivity index when used against T. gondii. We have identified TgPRP4K of T.gondii as the primary target of altiratinib using genetic target deconvolution,which highlighted key residues within the kinase catalytic site that conferreddrug resistance when mutated. We have further elucidated the molecular basis ofthe inhibitory mechanism and species selectivity of altiratinib for TgPRP4K andfor its Plasmodium falciparum counterpart, PfCLK3. Our data identified structuralfeatures critical for binding of the other PfCLK3 inhibitor, TCMDC-135051.Consistent with the splicing control activity of this kinase family, we haveshown that altiratinib can cause global disruption of splicing, primarily throughintron retention in both T. gondii and P. falciparum. Thus, our data establishparasitic PRP4K/CLK3 as a potential pan-apicomplexan target whose repertoire ofinhibitors can be expanded by the addition of altiratinib.

TI  - Exocrine pancreas regeneration modifies original pancreas to alleviate diabetesin mouse models.
PG  - eabg9170
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abg9170 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a major public health issue because of its widely epidemic nature andlack of cure. Here, we show that pancreas-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) are capable of regenerating exocrine pancreas when implanted into the kidneycapsule of mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Mechanistically, wefound that the regenerated exocrine pancreas elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) inPMSC implants, which transiently activated tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to inhibit IL-17, thereby rescuingdamaged exocrine pancreas and islet beta cells. In addition, we used knockoutmouse models to show that global lack of IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IFN-gamma resultedin increased severity of STZ-induced diabetes and resistance to PMSC implantationtherapy, confirming the roles of these factors in safeguarding pancreatic betacells. Furthermore, removal of the kidney capsule PMSC implants at 28 days after implantation did not affect the PMSC-initiated therapeutic effect on diabeticmice. This study reveals a previously unknown role of exocrine pancreasregeneration in safeguarding beta cells and demonstrates a "soil-rescues-seed"strategy for type 1 diabetes therapy.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype associated withearly metastatic recurrence and worse patient outcomes. TNBC tumors expressmolecular markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but itsrequirement during spontaneous TNBC metastasis in vivo remains incompletelyunderstood. We demonstrated that spontaneous TNBC tumors from a geneticallyengineered mouse model (GEMM), multiple patient-derived xenografts, and archival patient samples exhibited large populations in vivo of hybrid E/M cells that leadinvasion ex vivo while expressing both epithelial and mesenchymalcharacteristics. The mesenchymal marker vimentin promoted invasion and repressed metastatic outgrowth. We next tested the requirement for five EMT transcriptionfactors and observed distinct patterns of utilization during invasion and colony formation. These differences suggested a sequential activation of multiple EMTmolecular programs during the metastatic cascade. Consistent with this model, ourlongitudinal single-cell RNA analysis detected three different EMT-relatedmolecular patterns. We observed cancer cells progressing from epithelial tohybrid E/M and strongly mesenchymal patterns during invasion and from epithelial to a hybrid E/M pattern during colony formation. We next investigated therelative epithelial versus mesenchymal state of cancer cells in both GEMM andpatient metastases. In both contexts, we observed heterogeneity between andwithin metastases in the same individual. We observed a complex spectrum ofepithelial, hybrid E/M, and mesenchymal cell states within metastases, suggestingthat there are multiple successful molecular strategies for distant organcolonization. Together, our results demonstrate an important and complex role forEMT programs during TNBC metastasis.

LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abn1128 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains incurable despite aggressive implementationof multimodal treatments after surgical debulking. Almost all patients with GBMrelapse within a narrow margin around the initial resected lesion due topostsurgery residual glioma stem cells (GSCs). Tracking and eradicatingpostsurgery residual GSCs is critical for preventing postoperative relapse ofthis devastating disease, yet effective strategies remain elusive. Here, wereport a cavity-injectable nanoporter-hydrogel superstructure that createsGSC-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophages/microglia (MPhis)surrounding the cavity to prevent GBM relapse. Specifically, we demonstrate that the CAR gene-laden nanoporter in the hydrogel can introduce GSC-targeted CARgenes into MPhi nuclei after intracavity delivery to generate CAR-MPhis in mouse models of GBM. These CAR-MPhis were able to seek and engulf GSCs and clearresidual GSCs by stimulating an adaptive antitumor immune response in the tumormicroenvironment and prevented postoperative glioma relapse by inducing long-termantitumor immunity in mice. In an orthotopic patient-derived glioblastomahumanized mouse model, the combined treatment with nanoporter-hydrogelsuperstructure and CD47 antibody increased the frequency of positive immuneresponding cells and suppressed the negative immune regulating cells, conferring a robust tumoricidal immunity surrounding the postsurgical cavity and inhibiting postoperative glioblastoma relapse. Therefore, our work establishes alocoregional treatment strategy for priming cancer stem cell-specific tumoricidalimmunity with broad application in patients suffering from recurrentmalignancies.

PG  - 397-407
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2203067 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New approaches for the prevention and elimination of malaria, aleading cause of illness and death among infants and young children globally, areneeded. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety andpharmacokinetics of L9LS, a next-generation antimalarial monoclonal antibody, andits protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection in healthyadults who had never had malaria or received a vaccine for malaria. Theparticipants received L9LS either intravenously or subcutaneously at a dose of 1 mg, 5 mg, or 20 mg per kilogram of body weight. Within 2 to 6 weeks after theadministration of L9LS, both the participants who received L9LS and the controlparticipants underwent controlled human malaria infection in which they wereexposed to mosquitoes carrying Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 strain). RESULTS: Nosafety concerns were identified. L9LS had an estimated half-life of 56 days, and it had dose linearity, with the highest mean (+/-SD) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 914.2+/-146.5 mug per milliliter observed in participants who hadreceived 20 mg per kilogram intravenously and the lowest mean Cmax of 41.5+/-4.7 mug per milliliter observed in those who had received 1 mg per kilogramintravenously; the mean Cmax was 164.8+/-31.1 in the participants who hadreceived 5 mg per kilogram intravenously and 68.9+/-22.3 in those who hadreceived 5 mg per kilogram subcutaneously. A total of 17 L9LS recipients and 6control participants underwent controlled human malaria infection. Of the 17participants who received a single dose of L9LS, 15 (88%) were protected aftercontrolled human malaria infection. Parasitemia did not develop in any of theparticipants who received 5 or 20 mg per kilogram of intravenous L9LS.Parasitemia developed in 1 of 5 participants who received 1 mg per kilogramintravenously, 1 of 5 participants who received 5 mg per kilogram subcutaneously,and all 6 control participants through 21 days after the controlled human malariainfection. Protection conferred by L9LS was seen at serum concentrations as lowas 9.2 mug per milliliter. CONCLUSIONS: In this small trial, L9LS administeredintravenously or subcutaneously protected recipients against malaria aftercontrolled infection, without evident safety concerns.

TI  - Equine placental extract supplement as a night barking remedy in dogs withcognitive dysfunction syndrome.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.893 [doi]
AB  - With the aging of pet dogs, there has been an increasing trend insenility-related diseases; additionally, cognitive disorders accompanied byabnormal behaviours are a major burden for owners. Recently, there have been aseries of consultations regarding the fact that night barking, which is anabnormal behaviour, remarkably interferes with the owner's sleep and adverselyaffects the owner's quality of life. However, there has been no effectivesolution to this problem. In this study, three aged pet dogs diagnosed withdementia were administered an equine placental extract (eqPE) as pet supplement, which has been shown in laboratory models to improve cognitive function.Consequently, night barking ceased 1 week after the administration of eqPE incase 2 and it was observed to decrease in the other two dogs. Furthermore, night barking disappeared 2 and 3 weeks after the administration of eqPE in cases 1 and3, respectively. No recurrence or exacerbation of night barking was observed inthe three cases treated with the eqPE, and no adverse events were observed. Theseresults suggest that eqPE may be useful for improving night barking in pet dogswith dementia, and it is expected to be a new treatment method.

TI  - Targeting acetyl-CoA metabolism attenuates the formation of fear memories throughreduced activity-dependent histone acetylation.
PG  - e2114758119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2114758119 [doi]
AB  - Histone acetylation is a key component in the consolidation of long-term fearmemories. Histone acetylation is fueled by acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), andrecently, nuclear-localized metabolic enzymes that produce this metabolite haveemerged as direct and local regulators of chromatin. In particular, acetyl-CoAsynthetase 2 (ACSS2) mediates histone acetylation in the mouse hippocampus.However, whether ACSS2 regulates long-term fear memory remains to be determined. Here, we show that Acss2 knockout is well tolerated in mice, yet the Acss2-nullmouse exhibits reduced acquisition of long-term fear memory. Loss of Acss2 leads to reductions in both histone acetylation and expression of critical learning andmemory-related genes in the dorsal hippocampus, specifically following fearconditioning. Furthermore, systemic administration of blood-brainbarrier-permeable Acss2 inhibitors during the consolidation window reducesfear-memory formation in mice and rats and reduces anxiety in a predator-scentstress paradigm. Our findings suggest that nuclear acetyl-CoA metabolism viaACSS2 plays a critical, previously unappreciated, role in the formation of fearmemories.

TI  - Gammaherpesvirus-mediated repression reveals EWSR1 to be a negative regulator of B cell responses.
PG  - e2123362119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2123362119 [doi]
AB  - The germinal center (GC) plays a central role in the generation ofantigen-specific B cells and antibodies. Tight regulation of the GC is essential due to the inherent risks of tumorigenesis and autoimmunity posed byinappropriate GC B cell processes. Gammaherpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) utilize numerous armaments to drive infected naive B cells, independent of antigen, through GC reactions to expandthe latently infected B cell population and establish a stable latency reservoir.We previously demonstrated that the MHV68 microRNA (miRNA) mghv-miR-M1-7-5prepresses host EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) to promote B cellinfection. EWSR1 is a transcription and splicing regulator that is recognized forits involvement as a fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma. A function for EWSR1 in Bcell responses has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that 1) Bcell-specific deletion of EWSR1 had no effect on generation of mature B cellsubsets or basal immunoglobulin levels in naive mice, 2) repression or ablationof EWSR1 in B cells promoted expansion of MHV68 latently infected GC B cells, and3) B cell-specific deletion of EWSR1 during a normal immune response to nonviral antigen resulted in significantly elevated numbers of antigen-specific GC Bcells, plasma cells, and circulating antibodies. Notably, EWSR1 deficiency didnot affect the proliferation or survival of GC B cells but instead resulted inthe generation of increased numbers of precursor GC B cells. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that EWSR1 is a negative regulator of B cell responses.

TI  - Biological characterization of D-lactate dehydrogenase responsible for high-yieldproduction of D-phenyllactic acid in Sporolactobacillus inulinus.
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.14125 [doi]
AB  - PLA (3-D-phenyllactic acid) is an ideal antimicrobial and immune regulatorycompound present in honey and fermented foods. Sporolactobacillus inulinus isregarded as a potent D-PLA producer that reduces phenylpyruvate (PPA) withD-lactate dehydrogenases. In this study, PLA was produced by whole-cellbioconversion of S. inulinus ATCC 15538. Three genes encoding D-lactatedehydrogenase (d-ldh1, d-ldh2, and d-ldh3) were cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and their biochemical and structural properties werecharacterized. Consequently, a high concentration of pure D-PLA (47 mM) wasproduced with a high conversion yield of 88%. Among the three enzymes, D-LDH1 wasresponsible for the efficient conversion of PPA to PLA with kinetic parameters ofKm (0.36 mM), kcat (481.10 s(-1) ), and kcat /Km (1336.39 mM(-1) s(-1) ). Insilico structural analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the Ile307in D-LDH1 is a key residue for excellent PPA reduction with low steric hindrance at the substrate entrance. This study highlights that S. inulinus ATCC 15538 isan excellent PLA producer, equipped with a highly specific and efficient D-LDH1enzyme.

TI  - Metallo-alginate hydrogel can potentiate microwave tumor ablation for synergisticcancer treatment.
PG  - eabo5285
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abo5285 [doi]
AB  - Microwave ablation (MWA) as a local tumor ablation strategy suffers fromposttreatment tumor recurrence. Development of adjuvant biomaterials topotentiate MWA is therefore of practical significance. Here, the highconcentration of Ca(2+) fixed by alginate as Ca(2+)-surplus alginate hydrogelshows enhanced heating efficiency and restricted heating zone under microwaveexposure. The high concentration of extracellular Ca(2+) synergizes with mildhyperthermia to induce immunogenic cell death by disrupting intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Resultantly, Ca(2+)-surplus alginate hydrogel plus MWA can ablatedifferent tumors on both mice and rabbits at reduced operation powers. Thistreatment can also elicit antitumor immunity, especially if synergized withMn(2+), an activator of the stimulation of interferon genes pathway, to suppress the growth of both untreated distant tumors and rechallenged tumors. This workhighlights that in situ-formed metallo-alginate hydrogel could act asmicrowave-susceptible and immunostimulatory biomaterial to reinforce the MWAtherapy, promising for clinical translation.

TI  - Transcriptional variability accelerates preleukemia by cell diversification andperturbation of protein synthesis.
PG  - eabn4886
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abn4886 [doi]
AB  - Transcriptional variability facilitates stochastic cell diversification and canin turn underpin adaptation to stress or injury. We hypothesize that it mayanalogously facilitate progression of premalignancy to cancer. To investigatethis, we initiated preleukemia in mouse cells with enhanced transcriptionalvariability due to conditional disruption of the histone lysine acetyltransferasegene Kat2a. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing of preleukemia withfunctional analysis of transformation, we show that Kat2a loss results in global variegation of cell identity and accumulation of preleukemic cells. Leukemiaprogression is subsequently facilitated by destabilization of ribosome biogenesisand protein synthesis, which confer a transient transformation advantage. Thecontribution of transcriptional variability to early cancer evolution reflects a generic role in promoting cell fate transitions, which, in the case ofwell-adapted malignancies, contrastingly differentiates and depletes cancer stem cells. That is, transcriptional variability confers forward momentum to cell fatesystems, with differential multistage impact throughout cancer evolution.

TI  - A SOX2-engineered epigenetic silencer factor represses the glioblastoma geneticprogram and restrains tumor development.
PG  - eabn3986
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abn3986 [doi]
AB  - Current therapies remain unsatisfactory in preventing the recurrence ofglioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which leads to poor patient survival. By rational engineering of the transcription factor SOX2, a key promoter of GBM malignancy,together with the Kruppel-associated box and DNA methyltransferase3A/L catalytic domains, we generated a synthetic repressor named SOX2 epigenetic silencer (SES),which induces the transcriptional silencing of its original targets. By doing so,SES kills both glioma cell lines and patient-derived cancer stem cells in vitroand in vivo. SES expression, through local viral delivery in mouse xenografts,induces strong regression of human tumors and survival rescue. Conversely, SES isnot harmful to neurons and glia, also thanks to a minimal promoter that restrictsits expression in mitotically active cells, rarely present in the brainparenchyma. Collectively, SES produces a significant silencing of a largefraction of the SOX2 transcriptional network, achieving high levels of efficacyin repressing aggressive brain tumors.

AB  - Cancer is a predominant disease across animals. We applied a comparative genomicsapproach to systematically characterize genes whose conservation levels correlatepositively (PC) or negatively (NC) with cancer resistance estimates across 193vertebrates. Pathway analysis reveals that NC genes are enriched for metabolicfunctions and PC genes in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and immune response,pointing to their corresponding roles in mediating cancer risk. We find that PCgenes are less tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, are enriched incancer driver genes, and are associated with germline mutations that increasehuman cancer risk. Their relevance to cancer risk is further supported via theanalysis of mouse functional genomics and cancer mortality of zoo mammals' data. In sum, our study describes a cross-species genomic analysis pointing tocandidate genes that may mediate human cancer risk.

LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abp9908 [doi]
AB  - Invertebrates constitute the majority of animal species and are critical forecosystem functioning and services. Nonetheless, global invertebrate biodiversitypatterns and their congruences with vertebrates remain largely unknown. Weresolve the first high-resolution (~20-km) global diversity map for a majorinvertebrate clade, ants, using biodiversity informatics, range modeling, andmachine learning to synthesize existing knowledge and predict the distribution ofundiscovered diversity. We find that ants and different vertebrate groups havedistinct features in their patterns of richness and rarity, underscoring the needto consider a diversity of taxa in conservation. However, despite theirphylogenetic and physiological divergence, ant distributions are not highlyanomalous relative to variation among vertebrate clades. Furthermore, our models predict that rarity centers largely overlap (78%), suggesting that general forcesshape endemism patterns across taxa. This raises confidence that conservation of areas important for small-ranged vertebrates will benefit invertebrates whileproviding a "treasure map" to guide future discovery.

TI  - Continuous feeding strategy for polyhydroxyalkanoate production from solid waste animal fat at laboratory- and pilot-scale.
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.14104 [doi]
AB  - Bioconversion of waste animal fat (WAF) to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is anapproach to lower the production costs of these plastic alternatives. However,the solid nature of WAF requires a tailor-made process development. In thisstudy, a double-jacket feeding system was built to thermally liquefy the WAF toemploy a continuous feeding strategy. During laboratory-scale cultivations withRalstonia eutropha Re2058/pCB113, 70% more PHA (45 gPHA L(-1) ) and a 75% higher space-time yield (0.63 gPHA L(-1) h(-1) ) were achieved compared to previouslyreported fermentations with solid WAF. During the development process, growth andPHA formation were monitored in real-time by in-line photon density wavespectroscopy. The process robustness was further evaluated during scale-downfermentations employing an oscillating aeration, which did not alter the PHAyield although cells encountered periods of oxygen limitation. Flow cytometrywith propidium iodide staining showed that more than two-thirds of the cells wereviable at the end of the cultivation and viability was even little higher in the scale-down cultivations. Application of this feeding system at 150-L pilot-scale cultivation yielded in 31.5 gPHA L(-1) , which is a promising result for thefurther scale-up to industrial scale.

AB  - Western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, LeConte, is aninsect pest that poses a significant threat to the productivity of modernagriculture, causing significant economic and crop losses. The development ofgenetically modified (GM) crops expressing one or more proteins that confertolerance to specific insect pests, such as WCR, was a historic breakthrough inagricultural biotechnology and continues to serve as an invaluable tool in pestmanagement. Despite this, evolving resistance to existing insect control proteinsexpressed in current generation GM crops requires continued identification of newproteins with distinct modes of action while retaining targeted insecticidalefficacy. GM crops expressing insecticidal proteins must undergo extensive safetyassessments prior to commercialization to ensure that they pose no increased riskto the health of humans or other animals relative to their non-GM conventionalcounterparts. As part of these safety evaluations, a weight of evidence approach is utilized to assess the safety of the expressed insecticidal proteins toevaluate any potential risk in the context of dietary exposure. This studydescribes the food and feed safety assessment of Vpb4Da2, a new Bacillusthuringiensis insecticidal protein that confers in planta tolerance to WCR.Vpb4Da2 exhibits structural and functional similarities to other insect controlproteins expressed in commercialized GM crops. In addition, the lack of homology to known toxins or allergens, a lack of acute toxicity in mice, inactivation byconditions commonly experienced in the human gut or during cooking/foodprocessing, and the extremely low expected dietary exposure to Vpb4Da2 provide a substantial weight of evidence to demonstrate that the Vpb4Da2 protein poses noindication of a risk to the health of humans or other animals.

AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major zoonotic pathogen resulting inmanifestations as pneumonia and septic shock. The upper respiratory tract istypically thought to be the main colonization and entry site of SS2 in pigs, but the mechanism through which it penetrates the respiratory barrier is stillunclear. In this study, a mutant with low invasive potential to swine trachealepithelial cells (STECs) was screened from the TnYLB-1 transposon insertionmutant library of SS2, and the interrupted gene was identified as autolysin(atl). Compared to wild-type (WT) SS2, Deltaatl mutant exhibited lower ability topenetrate the tracheal epithelial barrier in a mouse model. Purified Atl alsoenhanced SS2 translocation across STEC monolayers in Transwell inserts.Furthermore, Atl redistributed the tight junctions (TJs) in STECs through myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signaling, which led to increased barrier permeability.Using mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), pull-down, bacterialtwo-hybrid and saturation binding experiments, we showed that Atl binds directly to vimentin. CRISPR/Cas9-targeted deletion of vimentin in STECs (VIM KO STECs)abrogated the capacity of SS2 to translocate across the monolayers, SS2-inducedphosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) and MLCK transcription,indicating that vimentin is indispensable for MLCK activation. Consistently,vimentin null mice were protected from SS2 infection and exhibited reducedtracheal and lung injury. Thus, MLCK-mediated epithelial barrier opening causedby the Atl-vimentin interaction is found to be likely the key mechanism by which SS2 penetrates the tracheal epithelium.

AB  - Cattle have a complex social organization, with negative (agonistic) and positive(affiliative) interactions that affect access to environmental resources. Thus,the social behaviour has a major impact on animal production, and it is animportant factor to improve the farm animal welfare. The use of data fromelectronic bins to determine social competition has already been validated;however, the studies used non-free software or did not make the code available.With data from electronic bins is possible to identify when one animal takes the place of another animal, i.e. a replacement occurs, at the feeders or drinkers.However, there is no package for the R environment to detect competitivereplacements from electronic bins data. Our general approach consisted increating a user-friendly R package for social behaviour analysis. The workflow ofthe socialh package comprises several steps that can be used sequentially orseparately, allowing data input from electronic systems, or obtained from theanimals' observation. We provide an overview of all functions of the socialhpackage and demonstrate how this package can be applied using data fromelectronic feed bins of beef cattle. The socialh package provides support forresearchers to determine the social hierarchy of gregarious animals through thesynthesis of agonistic interactions (or replacement) in a friendly, versatile,and open-access system, thus contributing to scientific research.

TI  - Perception of canine rabies among pupils under 15 years in Kwara State, NorthCentral Nigeria.
PG  - e0010614
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010614 [doi]
AB  - Rabies is an endemic, highly fatal, and vaccine-preventable disease with severesocio-economic implications. Most (99%) human rabies cases are transmittedthrough dog bites. Children under 15 years account for 40% of all dog bitevictims and 35-50% of all rabies deaths. Rabies awareness among this vulnerablegroup is critical to rabies prevention. However, there is a paucity of data onrabies awareness among pupils under 15. Hence, this study assessed the awareness and attitude of pupils under 15 years towards canine rabies in Kwara state inNigeria. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional survey of 1,388 pupilsacross the state using a structured questionnaire that was administered as aone-on-one interview using the Open Data Kit on Android phones in December 2019. Of the 1388 pupils included in this study, only 21.7% (n = 301) of them wereaware of rabies. The mean rabies score was 1.7+/-0.8 and only 29.2% (n = 88/301) of the pupils had adequate knowledge of canine rabies. The dog ownership rate was18.7% (n = 259) with an average of 1.93 dogs per household. Approximately 5% (n =66) of the pupils have been previously bitten by a dog. One-third of the dog bitevictims (35%, n = 23/66) were managed and treated at home and only 12% (n = 8/66)were treated in a health facility. The result of the multivariable logisticregression showed that students aged between 13-15 years were more likely (OR:1.93; 95% CI: 0.72-3.01; p < 0.001) to have adequate knowledge of rabies than theyounger pupils. Similarly, pupils that have dogs in their households (OR: 2.09;95%CI: 1.49-2.75; p < 0.001) and those that reside in Kwara South (OR:1.78 95%CI:1.29, 2.44; p < 0.001) were more likely to be aware and have adequateknowledge of canine rabies respectively. Finally, Pupils from non-dog-owninghouseholds were more likely (OR:2.2; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.42; p < 0.001) to have been bitten by dogs than those from dog-owning households. The awareness and attitude of pupils under 15 to canine rabies was poor. We advocate the introduction ofrabies lessons into the school curriculum in Kwara State to reduce the incidence of dog bites and prevent dog-mediated human rabies.

AB  - In the last years, the use of natural phytochemical compounds as protectiveagents in the prevention and treatment of obesity and the related-metabolicsyndrome has gained much attention worldwide. Different studies have shown healthbenefits for many vegetables such Opuntia ficus-indica and Beta vulgaris andtheir pigments collectively referred as betalains. Betalains exert antioxidative,anti-inflammation, lipid lowering, antidiabetic and anti-obesity effects. Thisreview summarizes findings in the literature and highlights the therapeuticpotential of betalains and their natural source as valid alternative forsupplementation in obesity-related disorders treatment. Further research isneeded to establish the mechanisms through which these natural pigments exerttheir beneficial effects and to translate the promising findings from animalmodels to humans.

TI  - A histone H3K9 methyltransferase Dim5 mediates repression of sorbicillinoidbiosynthesis in Trichoderma reesei.
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.14103 [doi]
AB  - Sorbicillinoids (also termed yellow pigment) are derived from either marine orterrestrial fungi, exhibit various biological activities and therefore showpotential as commercial products for human or animal health. The cellulolyticfilamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is capable to biosynthesizesorbicillinoids, but the underlying regulatory mechanism is not yet completelyclear. Herein, we identified a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase,Dim5, in T. reesei. TrDIM5 deletion caused an impaired vegetative growth as well as conidiation, whereas the Trdim5 strain displayed a remarkable increase insorbicillinoid production. Post TrDIM5 deletion, the transcription ofsorbicillinoid biosynthesis-related (SOR) genes was significantly upregulatedwith a more open chromatin structure. Intriguingly, hardly any expression changesoccurred amongst those genes located on both flanks of the SOR gene cluster. Inaddition, the assays provided evidence that H3K9 triple methylation (H3K9me3)modification acted as a repressive marker at the SOR gene cluster and thusdirectly mediated the repression of sorbicillinoid biosynthesis. Transcriptionfactor Ypr1 activated the SOR gene cluster by antagonizing TrDim5-mediatedrepression and therefore contributed to forming a relatively more open localchromatin environment, which further facilitated its binding and SOR geneexpression. The results of this study will contribute to understanding theintricate regulatory network in sorbicillinoid biosynthesis and facilitate theendowment of T. reesei with preferred features for sorbicillinoid production bygenetic engineering.

TI  - Impairments in learning and memory performances associated with nicotinicreceptor expression in the honeybee Apis mellifera after exposure to a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor.
PG  - e0272514
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272514 [doi]
AB  - Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholinereceptor (nAChRs) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. However, sufloxaflor (SFX) is thought to act in a different manner and is thus proposed as an alternative incrop protection. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of SFX andits sublethal effect on the honeybee Apis mellifera after acute exposure. Intoxicological assay studies, the LD50 value and sublethal dose (corresponding to the NOEL: no observed effect level) were 96 and 15 ng/bee, respectively. Usingthe proboscis extension response paradigm, we found that an SFX dose of 15 ng/beesignificantly impairs learning and memory retrieval when applied 12 h beforeconditioning or 24 h after olfactory conditioning. SFX had no effect on honeybee olfactory performance when exposure happened after the conditioning. Relativequantitative PCR experiments performed on the six nicotinic acetylcholinereceptor subunits demonstrated that they are differently expressed in thehoneybee brain after SFX exposure, whether before or after conditioning. We foundthat intoxicated bees with learning defects showed a strong expression of theAmelbeta1 subunit. They displayed overexpression of Amelalpha9 and Amelbeta2, anddown-regulation of Amelalpha1, Amelalpha3 and Amelalpha7 subunits. These results demonstrated for the first time that a sublethal dose of SFX could affecthoneybee learning and memory performance and modulate the expression of specific nAChR subunits in the brain.

AB  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is a fatal neurodegenerative,demyelinating disease caused by dysfunctional activity of galactosylceramidase(GALC), leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids including psychosine.While oligodendrocytes have been extensively studied due to their high levels of GALC, the contribution of astrocytes to disease pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells(iPSCs) from two donors with infantile onset Krabbe disease and differentiatedthem into cultures of astrocytes. Krabbe astrocytes recapitulated many keyfindings observed in humans and rodent models of the disease, including theaccumulation of psychosine and elevated expression of the pro-inflammatorycytokine IL-6. Unexpectedly, Krabbe astrocytes had higher levels ofglucosylceramide and ceramide, and displayed compensatory changes in genesencoding glycosphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting a shunting away from the galactosylceramide and psychosine pathway. In co-culture, Krabbe astrocytesnegatively impacted the survival of iPSC-derived human neurons while enhancingsurvival of iPSC-derived human microglia. Substrate reduction approachestargeting either glucosylceramide synthase or serine palmitoyltransferase toreduce the sphingolipids elevated in Krabbe astrocytes failed to rescue theirdetrimental impact on neuron survival. Our results suggest that astrocytes maycontribute to the progression of Krabbe disease and warrant further explorationinto their role as therapeutic targets.

AB  - An integral part of the courtship sequence of the German cockroach (Blattellagermanica) involves the male raising his wings to expose tergal glands on hisdorsum. When a female cockroach feeds on the secretion of these glands, she isoptimally positioned for mating. Core chemical components have been identified,but the effect of male diet on the quality of the tergal gland secretion remains unexplored. After validating the pivotal role of tergal feeding in mating, westarved or fed reproductively mature males for one week. We then paired each malewith a sexually receptive female and observed their interactions through aninfrared-sensitive camera. While starvation had no effect on male courtshipbehavior, it did influence the duration of female tergal feeding and matingoutcomes. Females fed longer on the gland secretion of fed males, and fed malesexperienced greater mating success than starved males (73.9% vs. 48.3%,respectively). These results suggest that the quality of the tergal glandsecretions, and by association mating success, are dependent on the nutritionalcondition of the male.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the abundance and distribution ofpsychrophilic microorganisms associated with spoilage in beef slaughterhouseenvironments after cleaning. The processing lines and equipment used inslaughtering and boning were swabbed, and the microbial count was determinedusing a TSA and MRS medium and Chromocult(R) Coliform agar incubated at 15masculineC and 37 masculineC, respectively. As a result, the brisket saw (handle side) and trolley hook were the most heavily contaminated with microorganisms,with each having a microbial adhesion rate of 66.7%. The microbial adhesion ratesof the apron and milling cutter (edge side) were 50%, respectively, and those of the foot cutter (edge and handle side), splitting saw (edge side), and knife(handle side) were 33.3%, respectively. Next, four colonies were randomlyisolated from the petri dish used for the bacterial count measurement to identifythe predominant microbial species of the microorganisms attached to eachequipment. As a result of Sanger sequencing analysis, yeasts such as Candidazeylanoides and Rhodotorula sp. and bacteria including Pseudomonas sp. andRhodococcus sp. were identified from the equipment used in the slaughtering line,and it was assumed that these microorganisms were of environmental origin. Incontrast, only Pseudomonas sp. and Candida zeylanoides were isolated from theboning line. Despite the use of cleaning operations, this study identified someequipment was contaminated with microorganisms. Since this equipment frequentlycomes into direct contact with the carcass, it is critical to thoroughly removethe microorganisms through accurate cleaning to prevent the spread of microbialcontamination on the carcasses.

AB  - Spatial patterns of stable isotopes in animal tissues or "isoscapes" can be used to investigate animal origins in a range of ecological and forensicinvestigations. Here, we developed a feather hydrogen isotope (delta2Hf) isoscapefor Brazil based on 192 samples of feathers from the family Thraupidae fromscientific collections. Raw values of delta2Hf ranged from -107.3 to +5.0 perthousand, with higher values at the Caatinga biome (northeast Brazil) and lowervalues at the Amazon and Pantanal. A Random Forest (RF) method was used to model the spatial surface, using a range of environmental data as auxiliary variables. The RF model indicated a negative relationship between delta2Hf and Mean AnnualPrecipitation, Precipitation in the Warmest Quarter, and Annual Temperature Rangeand positive relationships for amount-weighted February-April precipitationdelta2H (delta2Hp(Feb-April)) and Mean Annual Solar Radiation. Modelled delta2Hf values ranged from -85.7 to -13.6 per thousand. Ours is the first delta2Hfisoscape for Brazil that can greatly assist our understanding of both ecological and biogeochemical processes controlling spatial variation in delta2H for thisregion. This isoscape can be used with caution, due to its poor predictive power (as found in other tropical regions) and can benefit from new sample input, newGNIP data, ecological and physiological studies, and keratin standard materialbetter encompassing the range in feather samples from Brazil. So, we encouragenew attempts to build more precise feather H isoscapes, as well as isoscapesbased on other elements.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272079 [doi]
AB  - Atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Biomathematical modelling of the underlying disease and therapy processes might be a useful aidto develop and improve preventive and treatment concepts of atherosclerosis. Wehere propose a biomathematical model of murine atherosclerosis under differentdiet and treatment conditions including lipid modulating compound andantibiotics. The model is derived by translating known biological mechanisms intoordinary differential equations and by assuming appropriate response kinetics to the applied interventions. We explicitly describe the dynamics of relevant immunecells and lipid species in atherosclerotic lesions including the degree of blood vessel occlusion due to growing plaques. Unknown model parameters were determinedby fitting the predictions of model simulations to time series data derived from mice experiments. Parameter fittings resulted in a good agreement of model anddata for all 13 experimental scenarios considered. The model can be used topredict the outcome of alternative treatment schedules of combined antibiotic,immune modulating, and lipid lowering agents under high fat or normal diet. Weconclude that we established a comprehensive biomathematical model ofatherosclerosis in mice. We aim to validate the model on the basis of furtherexperimental data.

AB  - Numerosity is the set size of a group of items. Numerosity perception is a trait shared across numerous species. Numerosity-selective neural populations arethought to underlie numerosity perception. These neurons have been identifiedprimarily using electrical recordings in animal models and blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Here we use electrical intracranial recordings to investigate numerosity tuning inhumans, focusing on high-frequency transient activations. These recordingscombine a high spatial and temporal resolution and can bridge the gap betweenanimal models and human recordings. In line with previous studies, we findnumerosity-tuned responses at parietal sites in two out of three participants.Neuronal populations at these locations did not respond to other visual stimuli, i.e. faces, houses, and letters, in contrast to several occipital sites. Ourfindings further corroborate the specificity of numerosity tuning of in parietal cortex, and further link fMRI results and electrophysiological recordings.

TI  - miRNA-23a modulates sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 expression: studies in medullary thick ascending limb of salt induced hypertensive rats.
LID - gfac232 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfac232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The kidney is a main organ in the pathophysiology of essentialhypertension. Although most of bicarbonate reabsorption occurs in the proximaltubule, the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) of the nephron also maintainsacid-base balance by contributing to 25% of bicarbonate reabsorption. A crucialelement in this regulation is the sodium hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), aubiquitous membrane protein controlling intracellular pH, where proton extrusion is driven by the inward sodium flux. MicroRNAs (miRNA) expression of hypertensivepatients significantly differ from that of normotensive subjects. Aim of thisstudy was to ascertain the functional role of miRNA alterations at mTAL level.METHODS: By miRNA microarray analysis, we identified miRNAs expression profilesin isolated mTAL from high sodium intake induced hypertensive rats (HSD) versustheir normotensive counterparts (NSD). In vitro validation was carried out inrmTAL cells. RESULTS: Five miRNAs, involved in the onset of salt sensitivehypertension were identified, including miR-23a which was bioinformaticallypredicted to target NHE1 mRNA. Data demonstrated that miRNA-23a is downregulated in the mTAL of HSD rats while NHE1 is upregulated. Consistently, transfection of a miRNA-23a mimic in a mTAL cell line, using a viral vector, resulted in NHE1downregulation. CONCLUSION: i) NHE1, a protein involved in sodium reabsorption atmTAL level and blood pressure regulation, is upregulated in our model; ii) thisis due to a down-regulation of miRNA-23a; iii) expression levels of this miRNAare influenced by high sodium intake in mTALs of rats. The downregulation ofmiRNA-23a in human affected by essential hypertension corroborate our data andpoint on the potential role of miRNA-23a in the regulation of mTAL functionfollowing high salt intake.

PG  - 5
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.8.5 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To characterize postnatal ocular pathology in a Ndufs4-/- mouse model ofcomplex I deficiency using noninvasive retinal imaging and visual testing.Methods: Ndufs4-/- mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were analyzed at 3, 5, and7 weeks postnatal. Retinal morphology was visualized by optical coherencetomography (OCT). OCT images were analyzed for changes in retinal thickness andreflectivity profiles. Visual function was assessed by electroretinogram (ERG)and optomotor reflex (OMR). Results: Ndufs4-/- animals have normal OCT morphologyat weaning and develop inner plexiform layer atrophy over weeks 5 to 7. Outerretinal layers show hyporeflectivity of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and photoreceptor ellipsoid zone (EZ). Retinal function is impaired at 3 weeks, with profound deficits in b-wave, a-wave, and oscillatory potential amplitudes. Theb-wave and oscillatory potential implicit times are delayed, but the a-waveimplicit time is unaffected. Ndufs4-/- animals have normal OMR at 3 weeks andpresent with increasing acuity and contrast OMR deficits at 5 and 7 weeks.Physiological thinning of inner retinal layers, attenuation of ELM reflectivity, and attenuation of ERG b- and a-wave amplitudes occur in WT C57BL/6 littermatesbetween weeks 3 and 7. Conclusions: Noninvasive ocular imaging capturesearly-onset retinal degeneration in Ndufs4-/- mice and is a tractable approachfor investigating retinal pathology subsequent to complex I deficiency.Translational Relevance: Ophthalmic imaging captures clinically relevant measuresof retinal disease in a fast-progressing mouse model of complex I deficiencyconsistent with human Leigh syndrome.

TI  - Regulation Mechanisms of Virulence Genes in Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2021.0103 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is one of the most common E. colipathotypes reported to cause several outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. EHEC is a zoonotic pathogen, and ruminants, especially cattle, are considered importantreservoirs for the most common EHEC serotype, E. coli O157:H7. Humans areinfected indirectly through the consumption of food (milk, meat, leafyvegetables, and fruits) and water contaminated by animal feces or direct contact with carrier animals or humans. E. coli O157:H7 is one of the most frequentlyreported causes of foodborne illnesses in developed countries. It employs twoessential virulence mechanisms to trigger damage to the host. These are thedevelopment of attaching and effacing (AE) phenotypes on the intestinal mucosa ofthe host and the production of Shiga toxin (Stx) that causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. The AE phenotype is controlled by thepathogenicity island, the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). The induction of both AE and Stx is under strict and highly complex regulatory mechanisms. Thus, agood understanding of these mechanisms, major proteins expressed, andenvironmental cues involved in the regulation of the expression of the virulence genes is vital to finding a method to control the colonization of reservoirhosts, especially cattle, and disease development in humans. This review is aconcise account of the current state of knowledge of virulence gene regulation inthe LEE-positive EHEC.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05556-x [doi]
AB  - Through high-throughput RNA sequencing, we discovered a putative newcytorhabdovirus in the seeds of Rudbeckia sp., which we have tentatively named"rudbeckia virus 1" (RudV1). Its complete 12,502-nt genomic sequence containsfive open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 (putative nucleocapsid protein, N), ORF2(putative phosphoprotein, P), ORF3 (putative cell-to-cell movement protein, P3), ORF4 (putative matrix protein, M), and ORF5 (putative RNA-dependent RNApolymerase, L). BLASTp searches showed that ORF1, ORF3, ORF4, and ORF5 of RudV1are most closely related to the corresponding proteins of Tagetes erecta virus 1 (a putative member of the genus Cytorhabdovirus) with 33.87% (88% querycoverage), 55.98% (89% query coverage), 35.33% (94% query coverage), and 57.75%(98% query coverage) sequence identity at the amino acid level, respectively.Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparisons indicated that RudV1 is a novelmember of the genus Cytorhabdovirus within the family Rhabdoviridae.

TI  - Urinary Proteome Analysis of Global Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury RatModel via Data-Independent Acquisition and Parallel Reaction MonitoringProteomics.
LID - 10.1007/s12031-022-02055-1 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is the leading cause of death insevere hypotension caused by cardiac arrest, drowning, and excessive blood loss. Urine can sensitively reflect pathophysiological changes in the brain even at an early stage. In this study, a rat model of global cerebral I/R injury wasestablished via Pulsinelli's four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method. Overall, 164urinary proteins significantly changed in the 4-VO rat urine samples compared to the control samples by data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics technique(1.5-fold change, p < 0.05). Gene Ontology annotation showed that the acute-phaseresponse, the ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, endopeptidase activity, blood coagulation,and angiogenesis were overrepresented. After parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)validation, 15 differential proteins having human orthologs were verified as the potential urinary markers associated with cerebral I/R injury. Of these potentialbiomarkers, 8 proteins were reported to be closely associated with cerebral I/Rinjury. Nine differential proteins changed even when there were no clinicalmanifestations or histopathological cerebral damage, including FGG, COMP, TFF2,HG2A, KNG1, CATZ, PTGDS, PRVA, and HEPC. These 9 proteins are potentialbiomarkers for early screening of cerebral I/R injury to prevent the development of cerebral injury. KNG1, CATZ, PTGDS, PRVA, and HEPC showed an overall trend of upregulation or downregulation at 12 and 48 h after I/R injury, reflecting theprogression of cerebral I/R injury. These 5 proteins may serve as potentialbiomarkers for prognostic evaluation of cerebral I/R injury. These findingsprovide important clues to inform the monitoring of cerebral I/R injury andfurther the current understanding of its molecular biological mechanisms.

TI  - Cervical spinal cord stimulation for prevention and treatment of cerebralvasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: clinical and radiographicoutcomes of a prospective single-center clinical pilot study.
LID - 10.1007/s00701-022-05325-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm induced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality, for which there is noconsistently effective treatment. Cervical spinal cord stimulation (cSCS) hasbeen shown to induce vasodilatation and improve peripheral and cerebral bloodflow in both animal and human studies. This pilot study was performed to assessthe clinical effect and long-term results of cSCS treatment in aSAH patients.METHODS: This was the first IRB- and US FDA-approved prospective non-randomizednon-controlled study comprising of 12 aSAH patients (8 women, 4 men, age range34-62 years) treated between May and November 2008. All patients underwent up to 2 weeks of cSCS with a single percutaneously implanted 8-contact electrode.Neurological outcomes at discharge and follow-up of up to 13 years andmortality/complications rates were analyzed. RESULTS: All 12 aSAH patientsunderwent cSCS electrode implantation immediately after securing the aneurysm.Patients were stimulated for 10-14 consecutive days starting within 3 days ofaneurysm rupture. Angiographic vasospasm occurred in six patients; two patientsdeveloped new vasospasm-related neurological symptoms; both recovered completely by discharge time. One patient died from unrelated multi-system failure; the restwere followed up clinically (average, 7.5 years; range, 12-151 months) andangiographically (average, 6.5 years; range, 36-125 months). No delayed ischemic neurological deficits/strokes and no cSCS-related adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our short- and long-term data suggest that cSCS is feasible and safefor patients in the acute aSAH settings. Small size of the patient cohort andlack of control do not allow us to conclude whether cSCS is able to preventcerebral vasospasm, decrease its severity, and improve clinical outcomes in aSAH patients. However, our findings support further clinical trials and developmentof cSCS as a new concept to prevent and treat cerebral vasospasm.

TI  - Both sheep and goats can solve inferential by exclusion tasks.
LID - 10.1007/s10071-022-01656-y [doi]
AB  - Despite the domestication of sheep and goats by humans for several millennia, we still lack comparative data on their cognitive capacity. Comparing the cognitive skills of farm animals can help understand the evolution of cognition. In thisstudy, we compared the performances of sheep and goats in inference by exclusion tasks. We implemented two tasks, namely a cup task and a tube task, to identifywhether success in solving the task could be attributed to either low-levelmechanisms (avoiding the empty location strategy) or to deductive reasoning (iftwo possibilities A and B, but not A, then it must be B). In contrast to aprevious study comparing goats and sheep in a cup task, we showed that bothspecies solved the inferential condition with high success rates. In the tubetask, performances could not be explained by alternative strategies such asavoiding the empty tube or preferring the bent tube. When applying a strict setof criteria concerning responses in all conditions and controlling for thepotential effects of experience, we demonstrate that two individuals, a goat and a sheep, fulfil these criteria. This suggests that sheep and goats are able tomake inferences based on deductive reasoning.

AB  - This study evaluated the nutritive value of signalgrass (Urochloa decumbens StapfR. D. Webster) and sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.), and animal performancein grass monoculture pastures and in silvopastoral system (SPS) in the earlydevelopment stage, in the Agreste of Pernambuco. Four treatments were evaluatedin a randomized block design with three replications: signalgrass + Eucalyptusspp.; signalgrass + sabia; signalgrass monoculture and sabia monoculture.Holstein x Zebu crossbred calves (170 +/- 15 kg BW) were managed under continuousstocking with variable stocking rate (SR). The dry matter (DM), crude protein(CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and in vitro dry matter digestibility(IVDMD) of signalgrass and sabia were assessed, as well as forage allowance (FA),stocking rate (SR), average daily weight gain (ADG) and weight gain per area(WGA) over eleven evaluation cycles (March 2019 to January 2020). Signalgrass hadthe highest DM contents in March 2019 and January 2020 (456 and 507 g kg(-1),respectively), while for IVDMD the highest values ranged from 436 to 547 g kg(-1)(April to August 2019). Sabia presented the highest's IVDMD (311 and 381 g kg(-1)DM) and DM content (385 and 416 g kg(-1)) and lowest CP (110 and 82 g kg(-1) DM) and NDF (568 and 500 g kg(-1) DM) in November 2019 and January 2020,respectively. FA and SR decreased throughout the evaluation cycles. ADG (0.38 kg animal(-1) day(-1)) and WGA (17.89 kg ha(-1) 28 days(-1)) did not differ amongtreatments, with weight loss in the period of low water availability. In theearly development stage of the trees, SPS does not affect the nutritive value of signalgrass, nor the animal performance.

TI  - Lasting Effects of Helicobacter pylori Infection on the Microbial Communities of Patients with and without Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth.
PG  - 193-198
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) microbial populations are important in maintaining normalfunctioning of the GI by preventing disorders. Dysbiotic microbiota may increase the likelihood of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a syndromeassociated with significant morbidity. We aimed to inves- tigate the microbiotapopulations of patients with SIBO. Patients with symptoms of SIBO wereconsecutively enrolled; they underwent a SIBO hydrogen breath test and stool was collected for microbiome analysis by sequencing of the 16S rRNA. Of the 55patients recruited, 42 (76.4%) were positive for SIBO. When visualizing thebacterial beta-di- versity, a sub-cluster of patients was identified. Furtherexamination of these patients' records re- vealed previous treatment forHelicobacter pylori (HP). Microbiome analysis of these patients demonstrated asignificant decrease in beta-diversity (p-value<0.001) compared to patientswithout previous HP therapy. Furthermore, beta-diversity was significantlydifferent in this subgroup, and sev- eral bacterial taxa were differentiallyexpressed, including one from the genus Methanobrevibacter, which was reduced in patients that previously underwent HP treatment. Our findings suggest that while symptoms associated with SIBO may cause dysbiosis, there was no differentiationin fecal microbiome composition based on SIBO diagnosis. Furthermore, our resultssupport previous observations regarding antibiotic-altered microbiota witheffects extending two and three years post-treatment.

AB  - The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is unique in animal virology. It is the smallest ofhuman pathogens, re- quires the HBsAg capsid of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) toassembly into infectious virions, and parasitizes the transcriptional machineryof the host. Hepatitis D is ubiquitous but prevalence varies throughout theworld. It is the most severe form of chronic viral liver disorder. Vaccinationagainst the HBV has decreased the circulation of HDV in industrialized countries but Hepatitis D remains a significant medical issue in many areas of thedeveloping world.

LID - 10.1089/can.2021.0241 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cannabidiol (CBD), one major nonintoxicating phytocannabinoid fromCannabis sativa demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in animal models ofseveral inflammatory conditions, including arthritis. However, it is stillunknown which cell types mediate these anti-inflammatory effects of CBD, and,since CBD binds to a plethora of receptors and enzymes, it is complicated topinpoint its mechanism of action. In this study, we elucidate the effects of CBD on B cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in respect to survival,calcium mobilization, drug uptake, and cytokine (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF) andimmunoglobulin production. Methods: Modulation of intracellular calcium and drug uptake in B cells was determined by using the fluorescent dyes Cal-520 and PoPo3,respectively. Cytokine and immunoglobulin production was evaluated byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PBMC composition and B cell survival after CBDtreatment was assessed by flow cytometry. Results: B cells express two majortarget receptors for CBD, TRPV2 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 2) andTRPA1 (transient receptor potential ankyrin 1), which are not regulated by B cellactivation. CBD increased intracellular calcium levels in mouse and human Bcells, which was accompanied by enhanced uptake of PoPo3. These effects were not dependent on transient receptor potential channel activation. CBD increased thenumber of early apoptotic B cells at the expense of viable cells and diminishedinterleukin (IL)-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production when activated Tcell independently. In PBMCs, CBD increased IL-10 production when B cells wereactivated T cell dependent, while decreasing TNF levels when activated T cellindependently. In PBMC/rheumatoid synovial fibroblast cocultures, CBD reducedIL-10 production when B cells were activated T cell independently. ImmunoglobulinM production was augmented by CBD when B cells were activated with CpG.Conclusion: CBD is able to provide pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in isolatedB cells and PBMCs. This is dependent on the activating stimulus (T cell dependentor independent) and concentration of CBD. Therefore, CBD might be used to dampen B cell activity in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which Bcells are activated by specific autoantigens.

TI  - The inhibitory effect of paeoniflorin on reactive oxygen species alleviates theactivation of NF-kappaB and MAPK signalling pathways in macrophages.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001210 [doi]
AB  - Paeoniflorin (PF) has been proven to possess a protective effect in someinflammatory diseases, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Macrophages play central roles in inflammatory responses and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7macrophage is an ideal model for studying the anti-inflammatory effects andmechanisms of drugs. Thus, it was used to explore the anti-inflammatory mechanismof PF in this study. The results showed that PF markedly attenuated theactivation of NF-kappaB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38mitogen activated protein kinase (p38) signalling pathways induced by LPSexposure. In addition, PF pretreatment dose-dependently suppressed the productionof cytokines and the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS). Concomitantly, PF pretreatment dramatically inhibited the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) without affecting thephagocytosis of macrophages. Furthermore, it has proved the scavenging effect of PF on ROS was involved in the anti-inflammatory process. This study provides anovel aspect to the understanding of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PF.

TI  - Hematopoietic plasticity mapped in Drosophila and other insects.

AB  - Hemocytes, similar to vertebrate blood cells, play important roles in insectdevelopment and immunity, but it is not well understood how they perform theirtasks. New technology, in particular single-cell transcriptomic analysis incombination with Drosophila genetics, may now change this picture. This reviewaims to make sense of recently published data, focusing on Drosophilamelanogaster and comparing to data from other drosophilids, the malaria mosquito,Anopheles gambiae, and the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Basically, the new data supportthe presence of a few major classes of hemocytes: (1) a highly heterogenous andplastic class of professional phagocytes with many functions, calledplasmatocytes in Drosophila and granular cells in other insects. (2) A conserved class of cells that control melanin deposition around parasites and wounds,called crystal cells in D. melanogaster, and oenocytoids in other insects. (3) A new class of cells, the primocytes, so far only identified in D. melanogaster.They are related to cells of the so-called posterior signaling center of thelarval hematopoietic organ, which controls the hematopoiesis of other hemocytes. (4) Different kinds of specialized cells, like the lamellocytes in D.melanogaster, for the encapsulation of parasites. These cells undergo rapidevolution, and the homology relationships between such cells in different insectsare uncertain. Lists of genes expressed in the different hemocyte classes nowprovide a solid ground for further investigation of function.

TI  - Structural motifs for subtype-specific pH-sensitive gating of vertebrateotopetrin proton channels.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.77946 [doi]
LID - e77946 [pii]
AB  - Otopetrin (OTOP) channels are proton-selective ion channels conserved amongvertebrates and invertebrates, with no structural similarity to other ionchannels. There are three vertebrate OTOP channels (OTOP1, OTOP2, and OTOP3), of which one (OTOP1) functions as a sour taste receptor. Whether extracellularprotons gate OTOP channels, in addition to permeating them, was not known. Here, we compare the functional properties of the three murine OTOP channels usingpatch-clamp recording and cytosolic pH microfluorimetry. We find that OTOP1 andOTOP3 are both steeply activated by extracellular protons, with thresholds of pHo<6.0 and 5.5, respectively, and kinetics that are pH-dependent. In contrast,OTOP2 channels are broadly active over a large pH range (pH 5 pH 10) and carryoutward currents in response to extracellular alkalinization (>pH 9.0).Strikingly, we could change the pH-sensitive gating of OTOP2 and OTOP3 channelsby swapping extracellular linkers that connect transmembrane domains. Swaps ofextracellular linkers in the N domain, comprising transmembrane domains 1-6,tended to change the relative conductance at alkaline pH of chimeric channels,while swaps within the C domain, containing transmembrane domains 7-12, tended tochange the rates of OTOP3 current activation. We conclude that members of theOTOP channel family are proton-gated (acid-sensitive) proton channels and thatthe gating apparatus is distributed across multiple extracellular regions within both the N and C domains of the channels. In addition to the taste system, OTOPchannels are expressed in the vertebrate vestibular and digestive systems. Thedistinct gating properties we describe may allow them to subserve varyingcell-type specific functions in these and other biological systems.

TI  - Accounting for population structure in genomic predictions of Eucalyptusglobulus.
LID - jkac180 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkac180 [doi]
AB  - Genetic groups have been widely adopted in tree breeding to account forprovenance effects within pedigree-derived relationship matrices. However,provenances or genetic groups have not yet been incorporated into single-stepgenomic BLUP ('HBLUP') analyses of tree populations. To quantify the impact ofaccounting for population structure in Eucalyptus globulus, we used HBLUP tocompare breeding value predictions from models excluding base population effects and models including either fixed genetic groups or the marker-derived proxies,also known as metafounders (MF). Full-sib families from two separate breedingpopulations were evaluated across 13 sites in the 'Green Triangle' region ofAustralia. Gamma matrices (Gamma) describing similarities among MF reflected the geographic distribution of populations and the origins of two land races wereidentified. Diagonal elements of Gamma provided population diversity or alleliccovariation estimates between 0.24 to 0.56. Genetic group solutions were stronglycorrelated with MF solutions across models and MF effects influenced the genetic solutions of base population parents. The accuracy, stability, dispersion, andbias of model solutions were compared using the linear regression method.Addition of genomic information increased accuracy from 0.41 to 0.47 andstability from 0.68 to 0.71, while increasing bias slightly. Dispersion waswithin 0.10 of the ideal value (1.0) for all models. Although inclusion of MF didnot strongly affect accuracy or stability and had mixed effects on bias, wenevertheless recommend the incorporation of MF in prediction models to represent the hierarchical genetic population structure of recently domesticatedpopulations.

TI  - IL-6/STAT3/Foxo1 axis as a target of lycopene ameliorates the atrazine-inducedthymic mitophagy and pyroptosis cross-talk.
LID - 10.1039/d2fo01497a [doi]
AB  - The intensive adoption of atrazine (ATZ) is a source of a persistently widespreadpollutant in daily life. However, ATZ is still used as an essential herbicide in numerous countries because its toxic effect is not addressed as a public healthconcern. This study found that ATZ exposure caused mitophagy and pyroptosiscrosstalk in the thymus. And it could destroy the thymus architecture, inducingimmunodeficiency. Lycopene (LYC), a natural bioactive component, is applied toreduce the risk of chronic diseases caused by environmental factors. This workalso investigated the health benefits of LYC in the ATZ-induced toxic effect onthe thymus. LYC could ameliorate the ATZ-induced mitophagy and pyroptosis. LYCmodulated the IL-6/STAT3/Foxo1 axis, improving the level of CD45 in the thymus.This work sheds light on the toxic effect of ATZ on the thymus, and it willprovide evidence for ATZ health risks. Additionally, the finding also underscoresa novel target of LYC in maintaining thymic homeostasis in ATZ exposure.

TI  - Gap junction intercellular communication mediates cadmium-induced apoptosis inhepatocytes via the Fas/FasL pathway.
LID - 10.1002/tox.23629 [doi]
AB  - As a common environmental pollutant, cadmium (Cd) causes damage to many organs ofthe body. Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) represents one of themost important routes of rapid signaling between cells. However, the mechanismsunderlying GJIC's role in hepatotoxicity induced by Cd remain unknown. Weestablished a Cd poisoning model in vitro by co-culturing Cd-exposed andunexposed hepatocytes and found that 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a GJICinhibitor, can effectively reduce the apoptosis rate of healthy cells co-culturedwith apoptotic cells treated with Cd. We also found that anti-FasL antibody hadthe same effect. However, in mono-cultured cells, GA treatment in combinationwith Cd was found to aggravate the damage induced by Cd exposure, increase thelevel of oxidative stress and protein expression of HO-1, decrease themitochondrial membrane potential, incur more serious morphological damage tomitochondria than Cd treatment alone. Moreover, compared with Cd-only exposure,GA and Cd co-treatment further increased the expression levels of theapoptosis-related proteins Fas, FasL, FADD and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, inhibited the protein expression of ASK1 and Daxx. We also found that the proteinexpression of Daxx in siFADD + Cd hepatocytes was significantly higher than inCd-treated cells. Thus, our study suggests that gap junction inhibition may play a dual role in Cd-induced cell damage by inhibiting the transmission of deathsignals from damaged cells to healthy cells but also aggravating the transmissionof death signals between damaged cells, and that the Fas/FasL-mediated deathreceptor pathway may play an important role in this process.

TI  - THE ROLE OF ONCOLOGICAL PROCESS IN OCCURRENCE OF POSTOPERATIVE EVENTRATION.
PG  - 13-16
AB  - Eventration is one of the rare but the most dangerous postoperative complicationsin the abdominal surgery registered in 0.5-2.35% of patients. Eventration occurs most frequently after urgent surgery on the abdominal organs of weakened patientsof the old and elderly ages with a low immune-biological condition of the body.Examination of certain specific features of eventration occurrence withunderlying oncological process will allow better understanding the latter in the development of the postoperative complication. Therefore, the objective of theresearch was to examine experimentally the effect of malignant neoplasm on themechanical strength of the laparotomy wound postoperative scar on smalllaboratory animals, and to study clinically occurrence of postoperativeeventration development in patients with malignant neoplasms of the abdominalorgans. The experimental studies were carried out on 78 laboratory rats operated on by means of laparotomy 3,0 cm in length. Heren's carcinoma was preliminarygrafted under the skin of the external femoral surface in the main group ofanimals. The mechanical strength of the laparotomy wound scar was determined onthe 1st, 3rd and 5th days after surgery by means of measuring abdominal pressure at the moment of scar rupture. 140 were examined who underwent midline laparotomyfor surgical treatment of abdominal diseases. The main group included 98 patientswith malignant neoplasms of the abdominal organs who were divided into two groupsdepending on the stages of oncological process. The first subgroup included 46individuals at the I-II stages of the disease, and the second subgroup of themain group included 52 patients at the II-IV stages of the disease. The group of comparison involved 42 patients with acute surgical non-oncological pathology of the abdominal organs. Both groups of patients were comparable by the age andgender. An average age of patients in both groups of the study was 60.1+/-0.95years. An average length of the laparotomy wound was 27.1+/-0.25 cm. The obtainedresults were statistically processed on the personal computer by means ofelectronic tables Microsoft Excel and the package of statistical processingprogram IBM SPSS Statistics. The results of the experimental studies areindicative of the fact that malignant process in the body results not only ininhibited maturation of the granulation tissue in the laparotomy wound, but inreduced strength of the postoperative scar beginning with the 3rd day aftersurgery performed. Analysis of the results of our clinical study enables to admitreliable increase of occurrence of "local" postoperative complications including suppuration of the postoperative wound and eventration, especially whenoncological process is at the late stages of the disease. This specific featureshould be considered when sutures and drainage are applied on the laparotomywound in this group of patients. Thus, oncological process at the late stages of the disease promotes reduced strength of the laparotomy wound postoperative scar and results in an increased occurrence of eventration and suppuration of thepostoperative wound.

TI  - SLIDE: Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Self-Testing with RT-LAMP in a Mobile Device.
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c01023 [doi]
AB  - Regular, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive self-testing for severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed to quellpandemic propagation. The existing at-home nucleic acid testing (NAT) test hashigh sensitivity and specificity, but it requires users to mail the sample to thecentral lab, which often takes 3-5 days to obtain the results. On the other hand,rapid antigen tests for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen provide a fast sample to answerthe test (15 min). However, the sensitivity of antigen tests is 30 to 40% lowerthan nucleic acid testing, which could miss a significant portion of infectedpatients. Here, we developed a fully integrated SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) device using a self-collectedsaliva sample. This platform can automatically handle the complexity and canperform the functions, including (1) virus particles' thermal lysis preparation, (2) sample dispensing, (3) target sequence RT-LAMP amplification, (4) real-timedetection, and (5) result report and communication. With a turnaround time ofless than 45 min, our device achieved the limit of detection (LoD) of 5copies/muL of the saliva sample, which is comparable with the LoD (6 copies/muL) using FDA-approved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)assays with the same heat-lysis saliva sample preparation method. With clinicalsamples, our platform showed a good agreement with the results from thegold-standard RT-PCR method. These results show that our platform can performself-administrated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by laypersons with noninvasivesaliva samples. We believe that our self-testing platform will have an ongoingbenefit for COVID-19 control and fighting future pandemics.

TI  - Maternal H3K36 and H3K27 HMTs protect germline development via regulation of the transcription factor LIN-15B.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.77951 [doi]
LID - e77951 [pii]
AB  - Maternally synthesized products play critical roles in the development ofoffspring. A premier example is the Caenorhabditis elegans H3K36methyltransferase MES-4, which is essential for germline survival and developmentin offspring. How maternal MES-4 protects the germline is not well understood,but its role in H3K36 methylation hinted that it may regulate gene expression in primordial germ cells (PGCs). We tested this hypothesis by profiling transcripts from nascent germlines (PGCs and their descendants) dissected from wild-type and mes-4 mutant (lacking maternal and zygotic MES-4) larvae. mes-4 nascent germlinesdisplayed downregulation of some germline genes, upregulation of some somaticgenes, and dramatic upregulation of hundreds of genes on the X chromosome. Wedemonstrated that upregulation of one or more genes on the X is the cause ofgermline death by generating and analyzing mes-4 mutants that inherited differentendowments of X chromosome(s). Intriguingly, removal of the THAP transcriptionfactor LIN-15B from mes-4 mutants reduced X misexpression and prevented germline death. lin-15B is X-linked and misexpressed in mes-4 PGCs, identifying it as acritical target for MES-4 repression. The above findings extend to the H3K27methyltransferase MES-2/3/6, the C. elegans version of polycomb repressivecomplex 2. We propose that maternal MES-4 and PRC2 cooperate to protect germline survival by preventing synthesis of germline-toxic products encoded by genes onthe X chromosome, including the key transcription factor LIN-15B.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A new sugarcane-derived cystatin (CaneCPI-5) showed anti-erosiveproperties when included in solutions and strong binding force to enamel, but theperformance of this protein when added to gel formulations and its effect onsurface free energy (SFE) requires further studies. 1) to evaluate the protectiveeffect of gels containing different concentrations of CaneCPI-5 against initialenamel erosion (Experiment 1); and 2) to analyze the SFE (gammaS) after treating the enamel surface with CaneCPI-5 solution (Experiment 2). METHODOLOGY: InExperiment 1, 75 bovine enamel specimens were divided into five groups according to the gel treatments: placebo (negative control); 0.27%mucin+0.5%casein(positive control); 0.1 mg/mL CaneCPI-5; 1.0 mg/mL CaneCPI-5; or 2.0 mg/mLCaneCPI-5. Specimens were treated with the gels for 1 min, the AP was formed(human saliva) for 2 h and the specimens were incubated in 0.65% citric acid(pH=3.4) for 1 min. The percentage of surface hardness change (%SHC) wasestimated. In Experiment 2, measurements were performed by an automaticgoniometer using three probing liquids: diiodomethane, water and ethylene glycol.Specimens (n=10/group) remained untreated (control) or were treated with solutioncontaining 0.1 mg/mL CaneCPI-5, air-dried for 45 min, and 0.5 microL of eachliquid was dispensed on the surface to measure contact angles. RESULTS: Gelscontaining 0.1 and 1.0 mg/mL CaneCPI-5 significantly reduced %SHC compared to theother treatments (p<0.05). Treated enamel showed significantly lower gammaS than control, without changes in the apolar component (gammaSLW), but the polarcomponent (gammaSAB=Lewis acid-base) became more negative (p<0.01). Moreover,CaneCPI-5 treatment showed higher gammaS - (electron-donor) values compared tocontrol (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Gels containing 0.1 mg/mL or 1.0 mg/mL CaneCPI-5protected enamel against initial dental erosion. CaneCPI-5 increased the numberof electron donor sites on the enamel surface, which may affect AP formation and could be a potential mechanism of action to protect from erosion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leishmania (Mundinia) enriettii is a species commonly found in theguinea pig, Cavia porcellus. Although it is a dermotropic species, there is stillan uncertainty regarding its ability to visceralise during Leishmania life cycle.OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the ability of L. enriettii (strain L88) tovisceralise in lungs, trachea, spleen, and liver of C. porcellus, its naturalvertebrate host. METHODS: Animals were infected sub-cutaneously in the nose andfollowed for 12 weeks using histological (hematoxilin-eosin) and molecular tools (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism - PCR-RFLP). To isolate parasite from C. porcellus, animals were experimentally infected forviscera removal and PCR typing targeting hsp70 gene. FINDINGS: Histologicalanalysis revealed intense and diffuse inflammation with the presence ofamastigotes in the trachea, lung, and spleen up to 12 weeks post-infection (PI). Molecular analysis of paraffin-embedded tissues detected parasite DNA in thetrachea and spleen between the 4th and 8th weeks PI. At the 12th PI, no parasite DNA was detected in any of the organs. To confirm that the spleen could serve as a temporary site for L. enriettii, we performed additional in vivo experiments.During 6th week PI, the parasite was isolated from the spleen confirming previoushistopathological and PCR observations. MAIN CONCLUSION: Leishmania enriettii(strain L88) was able to visceralise in the trachea, lung, and spleen of C.porcellus.

AB  - Whitefly is one of the most widespread agricultural pests in the world. Essentialoils might be used to control this insect in an environmentally responsible way. The fumigant, repellent, and anti-oviposition activity of ethanol-extractedessential oils of Trachyspermum ammi, Withania coagulans, and Murraya koenigiiagainst Bemisia tabaci was investigated in this study. In the experiment, threeessential oil concentrations (2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL) were used.Trachyspermum ammi had the highest percentage of whitefly death in laboratoryexperiments due to its fumigant toxicity; the same tendency was found in contact toxicity and repellent effect. Mortality percent rises as the concentration ofessential oil increases with bioassay time. As the concentration of essential oilgrows with bioassay time, so does the mortality rate. The most adult whitefliesescaped from the treated plants' greenhouse due to the highest essential oilconcentration. The greatest repellency was found with Trachyspermum ammiessential oil at 10 mg/mL. The essential oil had the greatest anti-ovipositionefficacy against whiteflies. Trachyspermum ammi possessed the most potentanti-oviposition deterrent, followed by Withania coagulans in second place.Murraya koenigii finished third with moderate anti-oviposition, which affects thenumber of eggs produced in comparison to the control. As a consequence, thesethree oils might be used as an effective and environmentally acceptablebio-insecticide to control B. tabaci.

AB  - Angiogenesis (budding of new blood vessels) is involved in several processes,including the development of embryos and growth of tumors. Schinusterebinthifolia leaves express an antitumor lectin (SteLL). This workhypothesized that SteLL can interfere with the formation of a vascular networkfrom preexisting vessels. To test this hypothesis, the effect of SteLL on theangiogenesis process was assessed using an in vivo model of yolk sac membrane of Coturnix japonica embryos. SteLL was isolated with purification factor of 46.6.As expected, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for native basic proteins confirmed the homogeneity and PAGE in presence of dodecyl sodium sulphaterevealed a single 14-kDa polypeptide band. The fractal analysis by box countingand information dimension measurements indicated that SteLL at 1.35 mg/mLsignificantly decreased by ca. 12% the angiogenesis within the C. japonica yolksac membrane regarding the control. The inhibition of the vascular networkformation in the yolk sac membrane resulted in decreased blood supply to theembryos. Consequently, the area of embryos was significantly reduced by 9.2%regarding the control, which corroborated with the antiangiogenic activity ofSteLL. The findings implicate SteLL as an antiangiogenic agent and add to thepanel of biological activities of this lectin.

AB  - The aim of present study was to evaluate chemical composition and differentbiological activities viz., pharmacological and antioxidant activities ofessential oils. The chemical composition of essential oils was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry while biological activities were evaluated bystandard protocols. Essential oils of Hedychium spicatum Sm. from two differentecological niches viz; Nainital (Site-I) and Himachal Pradesh (Site-II) of India revealed the qualitative and quantitative chemo-diversity. Both the oils weredominated by oxygenated terpenoids. Major marker compounds identified wereeucalyptol, camphor, linalool, alpha-eudesmol, 10-epi-gamma-eudesmol, andiso-borneol. Both the oils exhibited anti-inflammatory activity suppressing 17.60% to 33.57 % inflammation at 100mg/kg b. wt. dose levels compared toibuprofen-treated group (40.06 %). The sub-acute inflammation in oils-treatedmice groups (50 and 100 mg/kg b. wt.) increased on day 2 but showed a gradualdecrease from day 3 onwards and then recovered to normal by day 10. Theantinociception percentage for doses (50 and 100 mg/kg b. wt.) ranged from33.70-40.46 % in Site-I and 30.34-42.39 % in Site-II compared to standard drug,ibuprofen (43.08 %). The oils also showed a good antipyretic effect bysuppressing Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) induced pyrexia after oildose injection. The oils also exhibited good antioxidant activity.

AB  - Temporary waters are common environments found in physical and biologicalsubstrates. Among them, some bromeliads species are known to hold water in their tanks, in a habitat called phytotelmata. Phytotelmata serve as habitats forseveral organisms, from bacteria and protists to arthropods and anurans.Peritrich ciliates are often found as epibionts on aquatic invertebrates in theseenvironments. Here, we report two cases of epibiosis involving Lagenophrys sp.attached to ostracods (Elpidium spp.) and Rhabdostyla sp. colonizing hydrachnidmites in the tanks of two bromeliad species. In our analysis, we measured thefrequency of epibiosis considering the presence of both basibiont and epibiont inthe samples. The results shown a significant difference between Elpidium sp. and Lagenophrys sp. compared to hydrachnid mites and Rhabdostyla sp. (87.5% and 19%, respectively), supported by the Kruskal-Walis test (p = 0.0003, Chi-square =9.687). These reports are important since the knowledge of phytotelmatacommunities from tropical and subtropical areas is incipient, although it hasbeen increasing over the last years. It also shows that epibiosis doesn't always represent a beneficial relationship. These two epibiosis systems found inbromeliad tanks raise questions about organism's dispersal throughout otherphytotelmata and other temporary water habitats.

AB  - The aim was to identify the predominant variables in the differentiation of meat quality of cattle submitted to surgical castration, immunocastration, ornon-castration and finished in a tropical pasture. Thirty-nine crossbred cattlewere used and distributed in three treatments: i) surgical castration; ii)immunocastration; and iii) non-castration, with an initial mean age of14.06+/-0.72 months and a mean weight of 284.10+/-31.40 kg. We used the principalcomponent analysis to differentiate the qualitative meat characteristics between the treatments. Based on that analysis, we found that the first three principalcomponents explained 71.44% of the total variation in the meat quality data,which ensures that the variation found is associated with the effect of thetreatments. The characteristics correlated with the first three principalcomponents and responsible for the discrimination between sexual conditions were subcutaneous fat thickness, instrumental meat color, cooking loss and shearforce. These characteristics were similar among castrated animals, regardless of the methods. Therefore, immunological castration preserves the attributes of the meat and prevents possible damage to the physical and mental integrity of theanimals. Finally, principal component analysis is an important methodology in theobjective investigation of beef meat attributes.

AB  - This study described for the first time, the synthesis of a greener, safer, andmore effective termiticide using a bio-based surfactant, N-acyl glycine derivedfrom palm oil for the control of Microcerotermes diversus. Laboratory findingsshowed that the highest repellent activity was observed in N-acyl glycinesurfactant (83.33%) at 50 ppm. In addition, N-acyl glycine surfactant alsoexhibited substantial time and concentration-dependent anti-termiticidal activityin which the highest termite mortality was observed after 3 days of exposure at50 ppm of the surfactant (100%). Furthermore, 32.49 ppm concentration of N-acylglycine surfactant (LC50 = 32.49 ppm) attained 50% of termite lethality. Thecurrent innovated termiticide with the use of N-acyl glycine surfactant offers a better efficacy, lower cost, and prevents the use of dangerous termiticides that are critical in creating a more sustainable environment, and controlsMicrocerotermes diversus at the same time.

AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is a free-living nematode, belonging to the bacterivorous trophic group. Although it was cited in several countries, in different types of ecosystems and in associations with other organisms, the wild habitats of thisnematode have not yet been precisely defined. In Argentina, C. elegans wasrecently isolated from the hoverfly Allograpta exotica, a voracious predator withpotential biological control against aphids in horticultural crops. In thisframe, the objectives of this study were (i) to characterize it molecularly andmorphologically (ii) to report a wild strain of C. elegans for the first timefrom Argentina, (iii) to present a new ecological niche by associating it with A.exotica and (iv) to evaluate the pathogenicity against these insects. The resultsof the morphological and molecular analyses made it possible to determine thatthe isolated nematode was C. elegans, thus establishing the ARGLP1900 wild strainas the first record of this nematode for Argentina. A new association wasdescribed, since there are no records of interaction between C. elegans and A.exotica, providing information on a new ecological niche. The new wild strainfound in this work, could be appropriate for comparative genomic studies withother C. elegans strains.

AB  - Canine visceral leishmaniasis is an endemic zoonosis in Brazil. Dogs are the mainhosts in urban environments. The treatment has gained popularity since theBrazilian government authorized miltefosine for canine treatment. The aim of thisstudy was to investigate the clinical and parasitological impact of short-termtreatment with miltefosine and allopurinol, alone and in combination. Weevaluated the ability of pharmacotherapy to reduce clinical signs of disease,antibody levels using the indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and skinparasite load via qPCR after 28 days of treatment. The therapeutic protocolspromoted a significant decline in clinical signs and in the skin parasite load indogs (p < 0.01). We observed a moderate correlation between the skin parasiteload and the clinical score in all three treatment groups (r > 0.5) Antibodylevels did not decrease in this short period. It was concluded that the treatmentwith allopurinol reduced the number of parasites in the skin of dogs withvisceral leishmaniasis in the short term. However, its efficiency is potentiated when associated with miltefosine.

AB  - Monogeneans Pricea multae naturally infested 42 of the 120 (35%) mackerel fish(Scomberomorus commerson) examined. For the first time, an infestation wasdiscovered off the coast of Jubil in the Arabian Gulf of Saudi Arabia. Based onthe structure clarified through light and electron microscopy of mountedspecimens and molecular analysis of rDNA and measurements of this monogeneanparasite was identified as P. multae. The tegumental surface of the parasite was characterized by tegumental ridges running transversally, generating folds inboth the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body at regular intervals. The study clarified the importance and function of the micro-structures, such as tegumentalfolds, perforations, sensory ganglia present on the parasite's surface, and thelarger hamulus supported by a relatively unmodified internal spine. Thismonogenean parasite has adapted to its host infestation site uniquely.

AB  - Parasitism of Colossoma macropomum is of particular concern because it is themost commonly farmed native fish species in Brazil. Nevertheless, the parasiticfauna of this species in the state of Acre has been little studied. For thisreason, an evaluation was made of the parasitic fauna of farmed C. macropomum in the municipality of Rio Branco in southwestern Amazon. Four monogenean specieswere found in the 122 fish examined: Anacanthorus spathulatus, Linguadactyloides brinkmanni, Notozothecium janauachensis and Mymarothecium boegeri. The mostprevalent species was A. spathulatus (50%), followed by N. janauachensis (44.3%),M. boegeri (20.5%) and L. brinkmanni (9.0%). These results are the first data on the ecological indices of monogeneans in tambaqui in the state of Acre and willbe useful for future comparisons of the influence of environmental factors on theparasite-host relationship.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the levels of environmentalcontamination in a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. For this, two areaswere chosen along the Mearim River: the reference area (A1) and the potentiallycontaminated area (A2), where water samples were collected, for physicochemicaland microbiological analyses, as well as specimens of Hoplias malabaricus, forthe evaluation of biometric data and incidence of branchial lesions. Thephysicochemical analyzes of the water from both areas showed contamination (lowlevels of dissolved oxygen, tubidity and high iron concentrations, especially in A2). The microbiological analyzes showed that all water samples showed totalcoliform values higher than those acceptable by CONAMA and WHO (with highervalues in A2), in addition to E. coli values higher than those allowed bylegislation in A2. Regarding biometric data, male and female fishes weresignificantly longer and heavier in A1 during the dry and rain seasons and thegonadosomatic index also showed higher values in A1 than in A2 in both seasons.H. malabaricus showed gill lesions of minimal to moderate pathological importancein A1 and A2, indicating that specimens from both areas of the Mearim Rivershowed biological responses to contamination. The observed changes in the waterquality, bimetic parameters and the histological analyzes of the specimens of H. malabaricus directly reflect on the quality and health of the fishes in theMearim River, and point to the urgent need for prevention and remediation ofcontamination in these ecosystems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Filling materials should be restricted to the root canal space.However, sometimes it is impossible to control the apical extrusion, in thiscase, the fate of the filling material and the result of the treatment willdepend on its physicochemical properties and biocompatibility. To evaluate thetissue response and bone repair capacity of endodontic sealers that wereimplanted in the calvaria of Wistar rats, forming the groups (n=16): AH Plus and Sealer Plus, compared to the clot group. METHODOLOGY: On days 30 and 60, theanimals were euthanized, the calvaria was removed and processed forhematoxylin-eosin, immunohistochemistry for collagen type I, Picrosirus red andmicrotomographic analysis. Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tuckey tests(p<0.05). RESULTS: At 30 days, all groups showed an intense inflammatory reaction(p>0.05). At 60 days, the AH Plus and Sealer Plus maintained an intenseinflammatory infiltrate compared to the clot group (p<0.05). We observedimmunopositive areas for type I collagen in all groups at 30 days and 60 days(p>0.05). We observed more red collagen fibers for the Sealer Plus compared tothe clot group at 30 days (p<0.05). Considering the total fibers, the clot group at 30 days compared to 60 days after surgery showed an increase in the amount of matrix (p<0.05). There were no statistical differences between groups for greenand yellow fibers (p>0.05). Regarding morphometric parameters, at 30 days, thenewly formed bone volume and number of bone trabeculae were higher in the groups with sealers compared to the clot group (p<0.05). At 60 days, AH Plus and Sealer Plus showed greater bone neoformation compared to the clot group (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Despite AH Plus and Sealer Plus induced an intense inflammatoryreaction, they can be considered biocompatible materials, since they allowed bonerepair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delayed autologous nerve graft reconstruction is inevitable indevastating injuries. Delayed or prolonged repair time has deleterious effects onnerve grafts. We aimed improving and accelerating nerve graft reconstructionprocess in a rat long nerve defect model with loop nerve graft prefabricationparticularly to utilize for injuries with tissue loss. METHODS: Twenty-fourSprague-Dawley rats were allocated into three groups. 1.5 cm long peroneal nerve segment was excised, reversed in orientation, and used as autologous nerve graft.In conventional interpositional nerve graft group (Group 1), nerve defects wererepaired in single-stage. In loop nerve graft prefabrication group (Group 2),grafts were sutured end-to-end (ETE) to the proximal peroneal nerve stumps.Distal ends of the grafts were sutured end-to-side to the peroneal nerve stumps 5mm proximal to the ETE repair sites in first stage. In second stage, distal ends of the prefabricated grafts were transposed and sutured to distal nerve stumps.In staged conventional interpositional nerve graft group (Group 3), grafts weresutured ETE to proximal peroneal nerve stumps in first stage. Distal ends of the grafts and nerve stumps were tacked to the surrounding muscles until the finalrepair in second stage. Follow-up period was 4 weeks for each stage in Groups 2and 3, and 8 weeks for Group 1. Peroneal function index (PFI), electrophysiology,and histological assessments were conducted after 8 weeks. P<0.05 was considered significant for statistical analysis. RESULTS: PFI results of Group 1(-22.75+/-5.76) and 2 (-22.08+/-6) did not show statistical difference (p>0.05). Group 3 (-33.64+/-6.4) had a statistical difference compared to other groups(p<0.05). Electrophysiology results of Group 1 (16.19+/-2.15 mV/1.16+/-0.21 ms)and 2 (15.95+/-2.82 mV/1.17+/-0.16 ms) did not present statistical difference(p>0.05), whereas both groups had a statistical difference compared to Group 3(10.44+/-1.96 mV/1.51+/-0.15 ms) (p<0.05). Axon counts of Group 1 (2227+/-260.4) and 3 (2194+/-201.1) did not have statistical difference (p>0.05), whereas bothgroups had significantly poor axon counts compared to Group 2 (2531+/-91.18)(p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Loop nerve graft prefabrication improved axonalregeneration without delay. Loop prefabrication can accelerate prolongedregeneration time for the injuries indicating a delayed nerve reconstruction.Higher axon counts derived with loop nerve prefabrication may even foster itsinvestigation in immediate long nerve defect reconstructions in further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Failure to achieve effective bleeding control and problems related totransfusion in liver surgery are the most common causes of post-operativemortality and morbidity. Various methods/drugs including topical hemostaticagents have been em-ployed for bleeding control in liver surgery. This study was aimed to investigate the hemostatic properties of the herb mixture extract ofInula viscosa and Capsella bursa-pastoris (IvCbp) in rat liver laceration model, which have been traditionally used as antiseptic and hemostatic agents public in Hatay/Tukey. METHODS: Thirty rats were divided into three groups equally andblood samples were taken from all rats for preoperative hemoglobin (Hb)measurements. Then, the standard liver resection model was applied to all rats.Sponge for the first rat group, Ankaferd Blood Stopper(R) Trend-Tech for thesecond rat group and IvCbp plant extract mixture for the third group were appliedto resection areas for 3 minutes. Liver samples of all rats were evaluated interms of inflammation and necrosis intensity on the 5th post-operative day.RESULTS: Post-operative Hb values were found as 11.0+/-1.1 g/dL in the spongegroup, 11.9+/-2.0 g/dL in the Ankaferd group, and 14.1+/-1.2 g/dL in the IvCbpherb mixture group (p<0.001). In the histopathological examination, less necrosiswas observed in the herb mixture group compared to the sponge and Ankaferd groups(p=0.001). In addition, no statistically significant necrosis difference wasobserved between sponge and Ankaferd groups. While less inflammation was observedin the herb mixture group compared to the other groups, Ankaferd group had thehighest inflammation score (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: IvCbp herb mixture extractgroup provide effective hemostatic control, caused less Hb decrease and resulted in less inflammation and necrosis compared to Ankaferd and sponge groups in a ratliver resection model.

PG  - 1073-1081
LID - 10.14744/tjtes.2021.97760 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute cardiac contusion induced by trauma is known with its highmortality and morbidity. The role of oxidative stress and inflammation in itspathophysiology has led to the investigation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatorysubstances in non-sur-gical treatment. In this study, the effects of rutin which has these two features on acute cardiac contusion were investigated. METHODS:Thirty male albino Wistar rats were divided into three equal groups as healthy(HG), contusion (CG), and rutin + con-tusion (rutin + CG). A heart contusion was created dropping 200 g weight from 1-m height onto anterior thorax of CG (n=10)and Rutin + CG (n=10) group animals by anesthetizing with intraperitonealadministration of 60 mg/kg ketamine and xylazine inhalation at appropriateintervals. Thirty minutes after contusion was applied, rutin at the dose of 50mg/kg was administered orally to the stomach by gavage to the rutin + CG groupanimals. The rutin was used once a day for 2 days. Rats were killed at the end of48 h. Heart tissues were removed and examined biochemically andhistopathologically. Troponin I (TP I) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) weremeasured in blood samples taken from the tail veins just before the rats werekilled. RESULTS: TP I, CK-MB, malondialdehyde, total oxidant status, and nuclear factor-kappa B levels increased in the CG when compared to the HG, and Rutinapplication prevented this increase, total glutathione (eGSH) and totalantioxidant status levels decreased, and rutin application prevented thisdecrease. Histopathological findings also supported these findings. CONCLUSION:Rutin had a protective effect on heart tissue.

PG  - 1066-1072
LID - 10.14744/tjtes.2021.64569 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autologous bone grafts still have been used as the gold standard to initiate and facilitate bone healing in cases with bone defects. Because ofsome disadvantages of autologous bone grafts, the new biocomposite grafts havebeen researched. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) loaded into a biocompositescaffold enhance bone regeneration. METHODS: In our study, a 10 mmosteoperiosteal segmental bone defect was created in the middle of the right and left ulnar bones of eight rabbits. The created defects were filled in the rightulnar bones of eight rabbits (Group I) with BM-MSCs loaded onto a bio-compositescaffold (Plexur PTM, Osteotech, Eatontown, NJ, USA) and in the other ulnar bonesof the same rabbits (Group II) with only biocomposite graft. Radiographs of each forelimb were taken postoperatively at the end of the 6th week. Then, the rabbitswere euthanized pharmacologically for histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: Werescored using a modified Lane and Sandhu scoring system. All defects healed inboth groups. Radiological and histo-logical total scores were slightly better in Group I, but statistical tests did not reveal any significant differences betweenthe two groups at the end of the 6th week radiologically and histologically(p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrated that in rabbit ulnar segmental bone defect model was obtained satisfactory regeneration with usingbiocomposite graft with or without BM-MSCs.

TI  - Crosstalk between arterial components and bioresorbable, 3-D printedpoly-L-lactic acid scaffolds.
LID - 10.1039/d2bm00732k [doi]
AB  - Bioresorbable scaffolds (BRSs) are designed to provide a temporary support thatsubsequently leaves behind native vessels after its complete degradation. Theaccumulation of mechanical changes influences the vascular histologicalcharacteristics and vice versa, leading to crosstalk and various behaviors inBRSs in different arterial components, which is different from that observed intraditional metal stents. Hence, we analyzed typical elastic and musculararteries, the abdominal aorta of Sprague-Dawley rats and carotid arteries of New Zealand rabbits, after both received 3-D printed poly-L-lactic acid BRSs. Weobserved a lower level of scaffold degradation and severe intimal hyperplasia in the carotid arteries of rabbits because of the synthetic phenotypictransformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) andendothelial-to-mesenchymal transition of endothelial cells (ECs). Extracellularmatrix remodeling and endothelial repair occurred in a less rapid manner in theabdominal aorta of rats. These results suggest that muscular arterial components such as SMCs and ECs are more sensitive to BRS degradation-induced mechanicalchanges compared to those of elastic arteries. Therefore, the rat abdominal aortamight be more suitable for assessing BRS degradation and safety, while thecarotid artery of rabbits could be used to evaluate drug coatings on BRSs, as it closely reflects the recovery of ECs and proliferation of SMCs. Our study alsoconfirmed that the histological characteristics of vasculature should beconsidered while choosing an animal model for BRS evaluation.

TI  - A Bioavailability Model to Predict the Impact of pH and Dissolved Organic Carbon on Ciprofloxacin Ecotoxicity to the Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa.
LID - 10.1002/etc.5454 [doi]
AB  - Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a pseudo-persistent antibiotic detected in freshwaterworldwide. As an ionizable chemical, its fate in freshwater is influenced bywater chemistry factors such as pH, hardness and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)content. Here, we investigated the effect of pH, DOC and Ca(2+) levels on thetoxicity of CIP to Microcystis aeruginosa, and developed a bioavailability model on the basis of these experimental results. We found that the zwitterion(CIP(+/-) ) is the most bioavailable species of CIP to M. aeruginosa, whereas DOCis the most dominant factor reducing CIP toxicity, possibly via binding of bothCIP(+/-) and CIP(+) to DOC. pH likely also regulates the CIP-DOC bindingindirectly through its influence on CIP speciation. In addition, higher toleranceto CIP by M. aeruginosa was observed at pH < 7.2, but the underlying mechanism isyet unclear. Calcium was identified as an insignificant factor in CIPbioavailability. When parameterized with the data obtained from toxicityexperiments, our bioavailability model is able to provide accurate predictions ofCIP toxicity, as the observed and predicted total median effective concentration (EC50total ) deviated by less than 28% from each other. Our model predicts thatchanges in pH and DOC conditions can affect CIP toxicity by up to tenfold,suggesting that CIP in many natural environments is likely less toxic than instandard laboratory toxicity experiments.

TI  - Effects of topical docosahexaenoic acid on postoperative fibrosis in an animalmodel of glaucoma filtration surgery.
LID - 10.1111/aos.15222 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as apotential antifibrotic agent after glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) in rats.METHODS: A total of 36 10-week-old Brown Norway rats underwent GFS. Animals were equally divided into three groups: a control group, a DHA group and a mitomycin C(MMC) group. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a dynamic reboundtonometer, and a photograph of the surgical site was taken on days 1, 3, 7, 10,14 and 17. The incorporation of DHA into fibroblasts was evaluated by gaschromatography. The expression of alfa-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and Smadproteins was assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: IOP decreased after surgeryin animals from the three groups on day 1 after surgery. Over time, IOP remained lower in the DHA and MMC groups than in the control group (median [interquartile range] 8.0 [7.0-8.0] and 8.0 [7.3-8.0] mmHg vs. 9.0 [8.0-9.0] mmHg, respectively;p < 0.001). Bleb area in the DHA and MMC groups remained larger than that of the control group from day 7 to day 14 (3.9 [2.9-5.2] and 3.5 [2.3-4.4] mm(2) vs. 2.3[2.0-2.8] mm(2) , respectively; p = 0.0021). We did not observe any change in DHAconcentrations in the fibroblasts of the DHA group compared with the othergroups. CONCLUSION: The impact of DHA on IOP and bleb area was similar to that ofMMC. The mechanisms of action of DHA in rat eye fibroblasts deserve furtherinvestigation.

TI  - Mcm2 hypomorph leads to acute leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell failure,dependent on genetic context.
PG  - e22430
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200061RR [doi]
AB  - Minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7) form a hexameric complex thatunwinds DNA ahead of a replicative fork. The deficiency of Mcm proteins leads to replicative stress and consequent genomic instability. Mice with a germlineinsertion of a Cre cassette into the 3'UTR of the Mcm2 gene (designated Mcm2(Cre)) have decreased Mcm2 expression and invariably develop precursor T-celllymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-T LBL), due to 100-1000 kb deletionsinvolving important tumor suppressor genes. To determine whether mice that wereprotected from pre-T LBL would develop non-T-cell malignancies, we used twoapproaches. Mice engrafted with Mcm2(Cre/Cre) Lin(-) Sca-1(+) Kit(+)hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells did not develop hematologic malignancy;however, these mice died of hematopoietic stem cell failure by 6 months of age.Placing the Mcm2(Cre) allele onto an athymic nu/nu background completelyprevented pre-T LBL and extended survival of these mice three-fold (median 296.5 vs. 80.5 days). Ultimately, most Mcm2(Cre/Cre) ;nu/nu mice developed B-cellprecursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). We identified recurrentdeletions of 100-1000 kb that involved genes known or suspected to be involved inBCP-ALL, including Pax5, Nf1, Ikzf3, and Bcor. Moreover, whole-exome sequencingidentified recurrent mutations of genes known to be involved in BCP-ALLprogression, such as Jak1/Jak3, Ptpn11, and Kras. These findings demonstrate thatan Mcm2(Cre/Cre) hypomorph can induce hematopoietic dysfunction via hematopoieticstem cell failure as well as a "deletor" phenotype affecting known or suspectedtumor suppressor genes.

TI  - Consumption of Wheat Peptides Improves Functional Constipation: A TranslationalStudy in Humans and Mice.
PG  - e2200313
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.202200313 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Wheat peptides (WP) are rich in glutamic acid, glutamine, and otherbioactive compounds that may benefit gut function and health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of regular consumption of WP on constipation-inducedcomplications and gut microbiota in humans and mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Arandomized trial of 49 functional constipation participants was conducted. Theweekly amount of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) increased by 2.09 per weekafter WP treatment, and by 0.40 per week among the placebo group (PL).Concomitantly, the secondary outcomes showed significant improvements in thequality of life-related to constipation, constipation severity, and satisfaction with the intervention. In the animal study, WP effectively alleviatedconstipation symptoms and affected the secretion of intestinal mobility-relatedneurotransmitters and gastrointestinal hormones in loperamide-inducedconstipation mice. Additionally, WP regulated the gene and protein expressionlevels of water-electrolyte metabolism and intestinal mobility. Furthermore, WPtreatment decreased the abundance of several gut microbiota positively correlatedto constipation (Turicibacter, Bacteroides_f_Bacteroidaceae, and Streptococcus)in mice. CONCLUSION: WP ameliorated constipation in humans and mice, which could be partly explained by improving water-electrolyte metabolism, boostingintestinal motility, and reshaping gut microbiota.

LID - 10.1080/14756366.2022.2106478 [doi]
AB  - p21-Activated kinase 4 (PAK4), one of the serine/threonine kinases activated byRho-family GTPases, has been widely studied as an oncogenic protein that isoverexpressed in many types of cancers. In our recent study, PAK4 upregulationwas observed in mice exhibiting hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) and in liver transplantation patients. Liver I/R injury was also attenuated in Pak4 KO mice.Herein, we report a novel series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives of typeI (1/2) PAK4 inhibitors. The most potent compound SPA7012 was evaluated todetermine the pharmacological potential of PAK4 inhibitor in I/R injury in mice. Mice with I/R injury showed typical patterns of liver damage, as demonstrated by increases in serum levels of aminotransferases and proinflammatory cytokines,hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration,relative to sham mice. Conversely, intraperitoneal administration of SPA7012dramatically attenuated biochemical and histopathologic changes. Mechanistically,stabilisation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a masterregulator of anti-oxidative response, was observed following SPA7012 treatment.SPA7012 treatment in primary hepatocytes also attenuatedhypoxia-reoxygenation-induced apoptotic cell death and inflammation. Together,these results provide experimental evidence supporting the use of PAK4 inhibitorsfor alleviation of I/R-induced liver damage.

PG  - 1315-1330
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2022.2107646 [doi]
AB  - Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) is an important pathogen, leading to the occurrence ofviral diarrhoea . As the infection displays obvious enterotropism, intestinalmucosal immunity is the significant line of defence against pathogen invasion.Moreover, as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show acid resistance, bile saltresistance and immune regulation, it is of great significance to develop an oral vaccine. Most traditional plasmid delivery vectors use antibiotic genes asselective markers, easily leading to antibiotic accumulation. Therefore, toselect a food-grade marker in genetically engineering food-grade microorganismsis vital. Based on the CRISPR-Cas9D10A system, we constructed a stableauxotrophic Lactobacillus paracasei HLJ-27 (Lactobacillus big up tri, openAlrHLJ-27) strain. In addition, as many plasmids replicate in the host bacteria,resulting in internal gene deletions. In this study,we used atemperature-sensitive gene editing plasmidto insert the VP4 gene into the genome,yielding the insertion mutant strains VP4/ big up tri, openAlr HLJ-27, VP4/ bigup tri, openAlr W56, and VP4/W56. This recombinant bacterium efficiently induced secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses. These oral mucosal vaccines have the potential to actas an alternative to the application of antibiotics in the future and induceefficient immune responses against PEDV infection.

AB  - The underlying mechanisms of trauma-related disorders are challenging to discoverand the disorders are difficult to treat, in part due to the complex and variedexpressions of response to traumatic stress. These challenges will be easier toovercome as more is understood about the variability in response to trauma.Incorporating assessment of variability into animal models of traumatic stressmay allow better translation to clinical research and treatment development. Inthis study, we characterized variability in behavioral responses followingtraumatic stress exposure using a predator exposure (PE) animal model. Elevatedplus maze (EPM) and acoustic startle response (SR) were used to study avoidanceand arousal symptoms in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Behavioral data were comparedbetween control (n = 31) and predator-exposed (n = 30) rats. PE behavior wasclustered using k-means principal components analysis. Four clusters and threedistinct subgroups were identified and were characterized as avoidant (Cluster 4,30%), moderately avoidant (Clusters 2 and 3, 49%), and unaffected (Cluster 1,17%). These results demonstrate that rodent responses to PE are varied, similarto human presentations following traumatic stress, suggesting it may be possible to develop treatment strategies for varied symptom presentations using apreclinical animal model.

TI  - MRNIP interacts with sex body chromatin to support meiotic progression,spermatogenesis, and male fertility in mice.
PG  - e22479
LID - 10.1096/fj.202101168RR [doi]
AB  - Meiosis has a principal role in sexual reproduction to generate haploid gametesin both sexes. During meiosis, the cell nucleus hosts a dynamic environment wheresome genes are transcriptionally activated, and some are inactivated at the same time. This becomes possible through subnuclear compartmentalization. The sexbody, sequestering X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis and creating anenvironment for the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) is one of the bestknown and studied subnuclear compartments. Herein, we show that MRNIP formsdroplet-like accumulations that fuse together to create a distinct subnuclearcompartment that partially overlaps with the sex body chromatin during diplotene.We demonstrate that Mrnip(-/-) spermatocytes have impaired DNA double-strandbreak (DSB) repair, they display reduced sex body formation and defective MSCI.We show that Mrnip(-/-) undergoes critical meiocyte loss at the diplotene stage. Furthermore, we determine that DNA DSBs (induced by SPO11) and synapsisinitiation (facilitated by SYCP1) precede Mrnip expression in testes. Altogether,our findings indicate that in addition to an emerging role in DNA DSB repair,MRNIP has an essential function in spermatogenesis during meiosis I by formingdrop-like accumulations interacting with the sex body.

TI  - Does the metabolizable energy influence the performance, carcass characteristics and biochemical parameters of European quails from 28 to 42 days of age?
LID - 10.1111/jpn.13754 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the metabolizable energy (ME) requirementfor quails (Cortunix cortunix cortunix) from 28 to 42 days of age. Four hundredand twenty quails were distributed in a completely randomized design, with 5treatments (2950, 3000, 3050, 3100 and 3150 kcal of ME/kg of feed), 7 replicates and 12 birds per experimental unit. Performance, relative weights of organs andviscera, carcass characteristics, meat quality, body composition and bloodparameters of the birds were evaluated. There was a reduction in feed intake(ADFI) with the use of 3150 kcal ME/kg (p < 0.01), with a quadratic effect onfeed efficiency (p < 0.01), estimating the energy requirement in the 3009.4 kcal ME/kg. The breast yield (BY) and the colour b* had an effect (p < 0.01), withbetter results for 2950 kcal ME/kg, while the meat texture reduced when the birdswere fed with 3150 kcal ME/kg. HDL and LDL showed the quadratic effect (p < 0.01)when ME increased to 3111.6 and 3157.4 kcal/kg respectively. Very low densitylipoprotein increased linearly (p < 0.01) in birds that received diets with 3000 kcal ME/kg. We conclude that the use of 3009.4 kcal of ME/kg for European quailmeets the nutritional needs and provides an improvement in feed efficiency,without affecting the carcass parameters of the birds. Information regarding the nutritional requirements for European quails is still recent; therefore, it isessential to know the adequate levels of metabolizable energy, an importantnutritional component for the maximum productive performance of birds.

TI  - Targeting PIM2 by JP11646 results in significant antitumor effects in solidtumors.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5404 [doi]
LID - 114 [pii]
AB  - Proviral integration of Moloney virus 2 (PIM2) is a prosurvival factor of cancer cells and a possible therapeutic target in hematological malignancies. However,the attempts at inhibiting PIM2 have yielded underwhelming results in earlyclinical trials on hematological malignancies. Recently, a novel panPIMinhibitor, JP11646, was developed. The present study examined the utility oftargeting PIM2 in multiple solid cancers and investigated the antitumor efficacy and the mechanisms of action of JP11646. When PIM2 expression was comparedbetween normal and cancer tissues in publicly available datasets, PIM2 was found to be overexpressed in several types of solid cancers. PIM2 ectopicoverexpression promoted tumor growth in in vivo xenograft breast cancer mousemodels. The panPIM inhibitor, JP11646, suppressed in vitro cancer cellproliferation in a concentrationdependent manner in multiple types of cancers; a similar result was observed with siRNAmediated PIM2 knockdown, as well as anincreased in cell apoptosis. By contrast, another panPIM inhibitor, AZD1208,suppressed the expression of downstream PIM2 targets, but not PIM2 proteinexpression, corresponding to no apoptosis induction. As a mechanism of PIM2protein degradation, it was found that the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib,reversed the apoptosis induced by JP11646, suggesting that PIM2 degradation byJP11646 is proteasomedependent. JP11646 exhibited significant anticancer efficacywith minimal toxicities at the examined doses and schedules in multiple in vivomice xenograft solid cancer models. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that PIM2 promotes cancer progression in solid tumors. JP11646 induces apoptosis at least partly by PIM2 protein degradation and suppresses cancer cellproliferation in vitro and in vivo. JP11646 may thus be a possible treatmentstrategy for multiple types of solid cancers.

TI  - HHLA2 promotes tumor progression by long noncoding RNA H19 in human gallbladdercancer.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5402 [doi]
LID - 112 [pii]
AB  - Advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the most malignant of all types ofbiliary tract cancers that is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Accumulating evidence suggest that the B7 family of proteins serve an essentialrole in various types of cancers, including GBC. However, the potential function and regulatory mechanism of human endogenous retrovirusH long terminalrepeatassociating protein 2 (HHLA2; also known as B7H7 or B7H5) in GBC remainpoorly understood. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was used to examinethe expression pattern of HHLA2 in samples from 89 patients with GBC. Thepossible association between HHLA2 expression and the clinicopathologicalparameters, including prognosis, were then assessed. Using lentiviruses,overexpression of HHLA2 plasmid or shorthairpin RNA (shRNA) of HHLA2 weretransfected into GBCSD cells to overexpress or knock down HHLA2 expression,respectively. The effects of HHLA2 overexpression and knockdown on theepithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) process on GBCSD cells were measured bythe western blotting and immunofluorescence staining of collagen I, Ncadherin,Ecadherin, vimentin and alphaSMA. By contrast, changes in cell proliferation weremeasured using EdU assay. Cell invasion and migration were assessed usingTranswell and woundhealing assays, respectively. In addition, a xenograft mousemodel was established to evaluate the tumorigenic ability of the GBC cell line invivo after stable transfection with lentivirus for HHLA2 overexpression or shRNA for HHLA2 knockdown. The regulatory relationships among TGFbeta1, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 (H19) and HHLA2 were then investigated. The mRNA expression oflncRNA H19 were assessed using reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR, whereas theexpression levels of HHLA2 were detected by western blotting andimmunofluorescence staining. HHLA2 expression was found to gradually increase as the stages of the GBC samples become more advanced. In addition, the expressionlevel of HHLA2 was calculated to be positively associated with the Nevin stage,American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, tumor invasion and regional lymph node metastasis but was negatively associated with the overall patient survival (OS). In vitro experiments demonstrated that overexpression of HHLA2 promoted GBCmigration, invasion, proliferation and EMT, whereas in vivo experiments found apromoting role of HHLA2 overexpression on GBC tumor growth. After transfectionwith lentiviruses encoding the overexpression plasmid of lncRNA H19, GBCmigration, invasion, proliferation and EMT were increased. By contrast, knocking down HHLA2 expression suppressed TGFbeta1 or lncRNA H19 overexpressioninduced GBCmigration, invasion, proliferation and EMT. In addition, HHLA2 knockdownsignificantly reduced the sizes of the GBC tumors in vivo. These results suggest that HHLA2 overexpression can promote GBC progression. Conversely, ablation ofHHLA2 expression inhibited both TGFbeta1 and lncRNA H19induced GBC progression,suggesting that HHLA2 is a potential therapeutic target for this disease.

AB  - Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a leading cause ofpulmonary hypertension. The present study investigated the mechanisms of longnoncoding RNA growth arrestspecific transcript 5 (GAS5) on spermidine (SP)inducedautophagy. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) were collected frompatients with CTEPH and the rat model. Immunofluorescence, Western blots, reversetranscriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction, bioinformatics, rapidamplification of cDNA ends assays, luciferase reporter assays, RNAbinding proteinimmunoprecipitation assays, GFPLC3 adenoviruses, tfLC3 assays and transmissionelectron microscopy were performed. The results revealed that SPinduced autophagyincreased GAS5 in PAECs. The upregulation of GAS5 enhanced and the downregulationof GAS5 reversed the roles of SP in PAECs. Furthermore, GAS5 promoted SPinducedautophagy in PAECs by targeting miRNA315p. The miRNA315p mimic suppressed and theinhibitor promoted SPinduced autophagy. Furthermore, NAcetyltransferase 8 Like(NAT8L) was a target gene of miRNA315p and knockdown of NAT8L inhibited theautophagic levels of PAECs. In vivo, SP treatment decreased miRNA315p andincreased NAT8L levels, which was reversed by the knockdown of GAS5. Thedownregulation of GAS5 abolished the stimulatory role of SP in PAECs of CTEPHrats. In conclusion, GAS5 promoted SPinduced autophagy through miRNA315p/NAT8Lsignaling pathways in vitro and in vivo and GAS5 may be a promising molecularmarker for therapies of CTEPH.1.

PG  - e62
LID - 10.4142/jvs.22009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The corneal and limbal morphology relevant to corneal epithelialmaintenance in ten different species was examined using histological methods.OBJECTIVES: The presence of a Bowman's layer, limbal epithelial cell, andsuperficial stromal morphology was examined in the following species to evaluate the differences in corneal thickness and epithelium: Java sparrows, frogs,macaws, spoonbills, red pandas, penguins, horses, Dobermans, orangutans, andhumans. METHODS: Corneal sections (4 microm) were obtained from ten ocular globesfrom three different animal classes: Aves, Amphibia, and Mammalia. All sectionswere stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff reaction. After microscopy, all stained slides were photographed and analyzed. RESULTS:Significant morphological differences in the corneal and limbal epithelia andtheir underlying stroma between species were observed. The number of cornealepithelial cell layers and the overall corneal epithelial thickness variedsignificantly among the species. The presence of a Bowman's layer was onlyobserved in primates (orangutans and humans). Presumed supranuclear melanin caps were noted in four species (orangutans, macaws, red pandas, and horses) in thelimbal basal epithelial layer (putative site of corneal epithelial stem cells).The melanin granules covered the apex of the cell nucleus. CONCLUSIONS:Supranuclear melanin capping has been described as a process within the epidermisto reduce the concentration of ultraviolet-induced DNA photoproducts. Similarly, there may be a relationship between limbal stem cell melanin capping as aprotective mechanism against ultra-violet radiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there are growing demands for stem cell-based therapy forcompanion animals in various diseases, a few clinical trials have been reported. Moreover, most of them are the results from only one or a few times of stem cell injection. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe a long-term treatmentwith allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in a dog with rheumatoidarthritis (RA), which is a rare canine disease. METHODS: The dog with RA receivedintravascular injection of allogeneic ASCs derived from two healthy donors once amonth for 11 months. To assess therapeutic effects of ASCs, orthopedicexamination and clinical evaluation was performed. Cytokines of tumor necrosisfactor-alpha and interleukin-6 in the plasma were measured using ELISA analysis. RESULTS: Despite this repeated and long-term administration of allogeneic ASCs,there were no side effects such as immunorejection responses or cell toxicity.The orthopedic examination score for the dog decreased after ASCs treatment, and the clinical condition of the dog and owner's satisfaction were very good.CONCLUSIONS: Although ASCs has been suggested as one of the options for RAtreatment because of its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions, ithas never been used to treat RA in dogs. The present report describes a case ofcanine RA treated with allogeneic ASCs for long-term in which the dog showedclinical improvement without adverse effects.

LID - 10.4142/jvs.22050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A definite diagnosis should be made in the bovine practice field,however, it was difficult to perform laboratory analysis immediately. Currently, three types of portable blood gas analyzers are available in Korea. OBJECTIVES:This study aimed to evaluate the correlations among these three analyzers.METHODS: Seventy-two plasma samples from Holstein-Friesian cows were used forblood gas analysis, and three instruments (EDAN i15 Vet, VETSCAN i-STAT, andEPOC) were operated simultaneously. Moreover, plasma calcium levels were comparedbetween these portable analyzers and blood chemistry device, which is usuallyused in a laboratory environment. Pearson analysis was performed to confirm thecorrelation of each parameter produced with the three instruments and bloodchemistry analyzer. RESULTS: As results, high correlation was observed inparameters of pH, pO2, potassium ion, ionized calcium, and glucose (p < 0.001, r > 0.7). In addition, pCO2 showed a moderate correlation among the three analyzers(p < 0.001, r > 0.5), and there was no correlation among all instruments forsodium ions. There was also a high correlation between ionized calcium from thethree portable devices and total calcium from the biochemistry analyzer (p <0.001, r > 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, there was a high correlation betweenresults from the three different blood gas analyzers used in the bovine clinical field in Korea. Thus, a consistent diagnosis can be made even with differentequipment if the operator is aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each piece of equipment and operates it properly.

AB  - Korean Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is currently facingsome operational pressing issues. 1) Review of the animal protocol containingcontroversial technology. 2) Review of the multi-institution animal protocol. 3) Review of veterinary clinical trials for client-owned animals. 4) Delay thereview process in large institutions with a single IACUC. Here, the followingthree solutions are proposed to address the above issues. 1) Establishment ofpublic IACUC. 2) Establishment of the Veterinary Clinical Study Committee as anadvisory body to the IACUC. 3) Operating multiple committees rather thanincreasing the number of committee members on a single committee.

TI  - Laryngeal silicone stent as a treatment option for laryngeal paralysis in dogs: apreliminary study of 6 cases.
PG  - e58
LID - 10.4142/jvs.22068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laryngeal paralysis is a common idiopathic degenerative neurological disease in older medium-to-large breed dogs, with surgical correction of theobstruction being the treatment of choice. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated theuse of laryngeal silicone stents to treat canine laryngeal paralysis in dogswhere classic surgical treatment was not accepted by the owners. METHODS: Dogsdiagnosed with laryngeal paralysis, for which the owners refused arytenoidlateralization surgery as a first-line treatment, were treated with laryngealsilicone stents. RESULTS: Six dogs with bilateral laryngeal paralysis wereincluded in the study. All dogs showed improvement in clinical signs immediately after the procedure. No clinical signs or radiographic changes were noted in fourout of six dogs in the follow-up visit performed 1 wk later. One dog wassuspected of aspirating water while drinking, but the signs disappeared afterrepositioning the stent. Another dog had a relapse of stridor due to caudalmigration of the stent. This dog underwent arytenoid lateralization surgerybecause larger stents are not commercially available. At the time of writing,between seven and 13 mon after stent placement, no significant incidents haveoccurred in four dogs, and all owners report a satisfactory quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal silicone stenting is an interesting alternative fortreating dogs with acquired laryngeal paralysis when the owners refuse classicarytenoid lateralization surgery. Furthermore, stent placement can be a temporarysolution to stabilize these dogs until a permanent surgical treatment can beperformed.

TI  - Epidemiological investigation and phylogenetic analysis of Classical Swine Fever virus in Yunnan province from 2015 to 2021.
PG  - e57
LID - 10.4142/jvs.22042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), the causative agent of classical swine fever (CFS), is a highly contagious disease that poses a serious threat to Chinese pig populations. OBJECTIVES: Many provinces of China, such as Shandong,Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces, have reported epidemics ofCSFV, while the references to the epidemic of CSFV in Yunnan province are rare.This study examined the epidemic characteristics of the CSFV in Yunnan province. METHODS: In this study, 326 tissue samples were collected from different regions in Yunnan province from 2015 to 2021. A reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR), sequences analysis, and phylogenetic analysis were performedfor the pathogenic detection and analysis of these 326 clinical specimens.RESULTS: Approximately 3.37% (11/326) of specimens tested positive for the CSFVby RT-PCR, which is lower than that of other regions of China. Sequence analysis of the partial E2 sequences of eleven CSFV strains showed that they shared89.0-100.0% nucleotide (nt) and 95.0-100.0% amino acid (aa) homology,respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel isolates belonged to the subgenotypes 2.1c and 2.1d, with subgenotype 2.1c being predominant.CONCLUSIONS: The CSFV was sporadic in China's Yunnan province from 2015 to 2021. Both 2.1c and 2.1d subgenotypes were found in this region, but 2.1c was dominant.

AB  - This paper reports a presumptive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cat. A cat with respiratory disease living with threeindividuals with coronavirus disease 2019 showed bilateral ground-glass opacitiesin the lung on X-ray and computed tomography. The clinical swabs were negativefor SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but the serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Interstitial pneumonia and prominent type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia were noted on histopathology. Respiratory tissues were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen, but the cat was positive for feline parvovirus DNA. In conclusion, therespiratory disease and associated pathology in this cat could have been due toexposure to SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the efficacy of the NDVgenotype-matched vaccine, mIBS025 strain formulated in standard vaccinestabilizer, and in carboxymethyl sago starch-acid hydrogel (CMSS-AH) followingvaccination via an eye drop (ED) and drinking water (DW). METHODS: A challengevirus was prepared from a recent NDV isolated from ND vaccinated flock. Groups ofspecific-pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with mIBS025 vaccine strainprepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer and CMSS-AH via ED and DW and thenchallenged with the UPM/NDV/IBS362/2016 strain. RESULTS: Chickens vaccinated withCMSS-AH mIBS025 ED (group 2) developed the earliest and highest Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) NDV antibody titer (8log2) followed by standard mIBS025 ED (group3) (7log2) both conferred complete protection and drastically reduced virusshedding. By contrast, chickens vaccinated with standard mIBS025 DW (group 5) andCMSS-AH mIBS025 DW (group 4) developed low HI NDV antibody titers of 4log2 and3log2, respectively, which correspondingly conferred only 50% and 60% protection and continuously shed the virulent virus via the oropharyngeal and cloacal routesuntil the end of the study at 14 dpc. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of mIBS025vaccines prepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer or CMSS-AH was affected by thevaccination routes. The groups vaccinated via ED had better protective immunitythan those vaccinated via DW.

TI  - Rare delayed cardiac tamponade in a pig after cardiac surgery.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.892 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Delayed cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening complication ofpericardial effusion in humans, has rarely been described in large animal models.We report here a pig with cardiac tamponade that developed 29 days after cardiac surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. ANIMALS: One 45-kg domestic pig. METHODS:Open-chest surgery was performed on a pig to induce chronic heart failure. At 15 days after surgery, the pig's breathing appeared laboured; induced heart failure was considered the cause. Routine heart failure medications were administered.RESULTS: On day 28, the pig's status deteriorated. On day 29, echocardiographyperformed just before the pig's death showed a large pericardial effusion, mainlyin the lateral and anterior walls of the right heart, with several fibreexudation bands. The right heart was severely compressed with an extremely small right ventricle. An emergency sternotomy was unsuccessful. Pathologic examinationshowed a severely thickened, fibrous pericardium. The pericardial sac wasdistended (up to 4.5 cm) and was full of dark brown, soft, friable material.Epicardial haemorrhage with a fresh, organised thrombus was noted in thepericardium. CONCLUSION: Delayed tamponade occurring at least 15 days afteropen-chest surgery is easy to misdiagnose or overlook in large animal modelswhere attention is often focused on primary pathological model changes. Todecrease mortality in animal models, researchers should be aware of potentialcomplications and use the same level of follow-up monitoring of large animals as in clinical care.

TI  - Water Physicochemical Parameters and Microbial Composition Distinguish Anopheles and Culex Mosquito Breeding Sites: Potential as Ecological Markers for LarvalSource Surveillance.
LID - tjac115 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac115 [doi]
AB  - The presence of mosquitoes in an area is dependent on the availability ofsuitable breeding sites that are influenced by several environmental factors.Identification of breeding habitats for vector surveillance and larval sourcemanagement is key to disease control programs. We investigated water qualityparameters and microbial composition in selected mosquito breeding sites in urbanAccra, Ghana and associated these with abundance of Anopheles (Diptera:Culicidae) and Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae. Physicochemical parameters and microbial composition explained up to 72% variance among the breeding sites andseparated Anopheles and Culex habitats (P < 0.05). Anopheles and Culex abundanceswere commonly influenced by water temperature, pH, nitrate, and total hardnesswith contrasting impacts on the two mosquito species. In addition, totaldissolved solids, biochemical oxygen demand, and alkalinity uniquely influencedAnopheles abundance, while total suspended solids, phosphate, sulphate, ammonium,and salinity were significant determinants for Culex. The correlation of thesemultiple parameters with the occurrence of each mosquito species was high (R2 =0.99, P < 0.0001). Bacterial content assessment of the breeding ponds revealedthat the most abundant bacterial phyla were Patescibacteria, Cyanobacteria, andProteobacteria, constituting >70% of the total bacterial richness. Theoligotrophic Patescibacteria was strongly associated with Anopheles suggestive ofthe mosquito's adaptation to environments with less nutrients, while predominanceof Cyanobacteria, indicative of rich nutritional source was associated with Culexlarval ponds. We propose further evaluation of these significant abiotic andbiotic parameters in field identification of larval sources and how knowledge of these can be harnessed effectively to reduce conducive breeding sites formosquitoes.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 evolution and patient immunological history shape the breadth andpotency of antibody-mediated immunity.
LID - jiac332 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac332 [doi]
AB  - Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinctSARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/orvaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediatedresponse is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responsesagainst SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha, SARS-CoV-2delta and SARS-CoV-2omicronpseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories,including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha orSARS-CoV-2delta, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadthand potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, thevariant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and thatindividuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposureexhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that theinterplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape theantigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with importantimplications for future vaccine design.

TI  - Plasmodium berghei leucine-rich repeat protein 1 downregulates proteinphosphatase 1 activity and is required for efficient oocyst development.
PG  - 220015
LID - 10.1098/rsob.220015 [doi]
AB  - Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a key enzyme for Plasmodium development. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying its regulation remain to be deciphered. Here, we report the functional characterization of the Plasmodium berghei leucine-rich repeat protein 1 (PbLRR1), an orthologue of SDS22, one of the most ancient andconserved PP1 interactors. Our study shows that PbLRR1 is expressed duringintra-erythrocytic development of the parasite, and up to the zygote stage inmosquitoes. PbLRR1 can be found in complex with PbPP1 in both asexual and sexual stages and inhibits its phosphatase activity. Genetic analysis demonstrates that PbLRR1 depletion adversely affects the development of oocysts. PbLRR1 interactomeanalysis associated with phospho-proteomics studies identifies several novelputative PbLRR1/PbPP1 partners. Some of these partners have previously beencharacterized as essential for the parasite sexual development. Interestingly,and for the first time, Inhibitor 3 (I3), a well-known and direct interactant of Plasmodium PP1, was found to be drastically hypophosphorylated in PbLRR1-depletedparasites. These data, along with the detection of I3 with PP1 in the LRR1interactome, strongly suggest that the phosphorylation status of PbI3 is underthe control of the PP1-LRR1 complex and could contribute (in)directly to oocystdevelopment. This study provides new insights into previously unrecognized PbPP1 fine regulation of Plasmodium oocyst development through its interaction withPbLRR1.

TI  - No evidence of predicted phenotypic changes after hurricane disturbance in ashade-specialist Caribbean anole.
PG  - 20220152
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2022.0152 [doi]
AB  - Extreme climatic events (ECEs) such as hurricanes have been hypothesized to be a major driving force of natural selection. Recent studies argue that, followingstrong hurricane disturbance, Anolis lizards in the Caribbean undergo selectionfor traits such as longer forelimbs or smaller body sizes that improve theirclinging ability to their substrates increasing their chances of survivinghurricane wind gusts. Some authors challenge the generalization of thishypothesis arguing that other mechanisms may explain these phenotypic changes or that they may not necessarily be generalizable across systems. To address thisissue, we compared body size and relative forelimb length of Anolis gundlachi, a trunk-ground anole living in closed-canopy forests in Puerto Rico, before, fourmonths after, and 15 months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. Overall, ourresults show no clear evidence of a temporal decrease in body size or increaseforelimb length (relative to body size) challenging the generalizability of theclinging ability hypothesis. Understanding how animals adapt to ECE is anemerging field. Still, we are quickly learning that this process is complex andnuanced.

AB  - Our understanding of state-dependent behaviour is reliant on identifyingphysiological indicators of condition. Telomeres are of growing interest forunderstanding behaviour as they capture differences in biological state andresidual lifespan. To understand the significance of variable telomere lengthsfor behaviour and test two hypotheses describing the relationship betweentelomeres and behaviour (i.e. the causation and the selective adoptionhypotheses), we assessed if telomere lengths are longitudinally repeatable traitsrelated to spring migratory behaviour in captive pine siskins (Spinus pinus).Pine siskins are nomadic songbirds that exhibit highly flexible, facultativemigrations, including a period of spring nomadism. Captive individuals exhibitextensive variation in spring migratory restlessness and are an excellent system for mechanistic studies of migratory behaviour. Telomere lengths were found to besignificantly repeatable (R = 0.51) over four months, and shorter pre-migratorytelomeres were associated with earlier and more intense expression of springnocturnal migratory restlessness. Telomere dynamics did not vary with migratorybehaviour. Our results describe the relationship between telomere length andmigratory behaviour and provide support for the selective adoption hypothesis.More broadly, we provide a novel perspective on the significance of variabletelomere lengths for animal behaviour and the timing of annual cycle events.

AB  - Zoonoses represent a global public health threat. Understanding lay perceptionsof risk associated with these diseases can better inform proportionate policyinterventions that mitigate their current and future impacts. While individualzoonoses (e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy) have received scientific andpublic attention, we know little about how multiple zoonotic diseases varyrelative to each other in lay risk perceptions. To this end, we examined publicperceptions of 11 zoonoses across 12 qualitative attributes of risk among the UK public (n = 727, volunteer sample), using an online survey. We found thatattribute ratings were predominantly explained via two basic dimensions of riskrelated to public knowledge and dread. We also show that, despite participantsreporting low familiarity with most of the diseases presented, zoonoses wereperceived as essentially avoidable. These findings imply that infection is viewedas dependent upon actions under personal control which has significantimplications for policy development.

TI  - Pitcher geometry facilitates extrinsically powered 'springboard trapping' incarnivorous Nepenthes gracilis pitcher plants.
PG  - 20220106
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2022.0106 [doi]
AB  - Carnivorous pitcher plants capture insects in cup-shaped leaves that function as motionless pitfall traps. Nepenthes gracilis evolved a unique 'springboard'trapping mechanism that exploits the impact energy of falling raindrops toactuate a fast pivoting motion of the canopy-like pitcher lid. We superimposedmultiple computed micro-tomography images of the same pitcher to reveal distinct deformation patterns in lid-trapping N. gracilis and closely relatedpitfall-trapping N. rafflesiana. We found prominent differences between downward and upward lid displacement in N. gracilis only. Downward displacement wascharacterized by bending in two distinct deformation zones whist upwarddisplacement was accomplished by evenly distributed straightening of the entireupper rear section of the pitcher. This suggests an anisotropic impact response, which may help to maximize initial jerk forces for prey capture, as well as thesubsequent damping of the oscillation. Our results point to a key role of pitchergeometry for effective 'springboard' trapping in N. gracilis.

LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.1085 [doi]
AB  - The pursuit of prey is vital to the biology of a predator and many aspects ofpredatory behaviour are well-studied. However, it is unclear how a pursuit can beeffective when the prey is faster than a non-cryptic predator. Using kinematicmeasurements, we considered the strategy of red lionfish (Pterois volitans) asthey pursued a faster prey fish (Chromis viridis) under laboratory conditions.Despite swimming about half as fast as C. viridis, lionfish succeeded incapturing prey in 61% of our experiments. This successful pursuit behaviour wasdefined by three critical characteristics. First, lionfish targeted C. viridiswith pure pursuit by adjusting their heading towards the prey's position and not the anticipated point of interception. Second, lionfish pursued prey withuninterrupted motion. By contrast, C. viridis moved intermittently with variationin speed that included slow swimming. Such periods allowed lionfish to close the distance to a prey and initiate a suction-feeding strike at a relatively closedistance (less than 9 cm). Finally, lionfish exhibited a high rate of strikesuccess, capturing prey in 74% of all strikes. These characteristics comprise abehaviour that we call the 'persistent-predation strategy', which may beexhibited by a diversity of predators with relatively slow locomotion.

PG  - 20221106
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.1106 [doi]
AB  - Host density shapes infection risk through two opposing phenomena. First, wheninfective stages are subdivided among multiple hosts, greater host densitiesdecrease infection risk through 'safety in numbers'. Hosts, however, representresources for parasites, and greater host availability also fuels parasitereproduction. Hence, host density increases infection risk through'density-dependent transmission'. Theory proposes that these phenomena are notdisparate outcomes but occur over different timescales. That is, higher hostdensities may reduce short-term infection risk, but because they support parasitereproduction, may increase long-term risk. We tested this theory in azooplankton-disease system with laboratory experiments and field observations.Supporting theory, we found that negative density-risk relationships (safety innumbers) sometimes emerged over short timescales, but these relationshipsreversed to 'density-dependent transmission' within two generations. By allowing parasite numerical responses to play out, time can shift the consequences of hostdensity, from reduced immediate risk to amplified future risk.

TI  - The ontogeny of asymmetry in echolocating whales.
PG  - 20221090
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.1090 [doi]
AB  - Extreme asymmetry of the skull is one of the most distinctive traits thatcharacterizes toothed whales (Odontoceti, Cetacea). The origin and function ofcranial asymmetry are connected to the evolution of echolocation, the ability to use high-frequency sounds to navigate the surrounding environment. Although this novel phenotype must arise through changes in cranial development, the ontogenyof cetacean asymmetry has never been investigated. Here we use three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to quantify the changes in degree of asymmetry and skull shape during prenatal and postnatal ontogeny for five genera spanning odontocete diversity (oceanic dolphins, porpoises and beluga). Asymmetry in early ontogenystarts low and tracks phylogenetic relatedness of taxa. Distantly related taxathat share aspects of their ecology overwrite these initial differences viaheterochronic shifts, ultimately converging on comparable high levels of skullasymmetry. Porpoises maintain low levels of asymmetry into maturity and present adecelerated rate of growth, probably retained from the ancestral condition.Ancestral state reconstruction of allometric trajectories demonstrates that both paedomorphism and peramorphism contribute to cranial shape diversity acrossodontocetes. This study provides a striking example of how divergentdevelopmental pathways can produce convergent ecological adaptations, even forsome of the most unusual phenotypes exhibited among vertebrates.

TI  - Orthovoltage X-Rays Exhibit Increased Efficacy Compared with gamma-Rays inPreclinical Irradiation.
PG  - 2678-2691
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-0656 [doi]
AB  - Radionuclide irradiators (137Cs and 60Co) are commonly used in preclinicalstudies ranging from cancer therapy to stem cell biology. Amidst concerns ofradiological terrorism, there are institutional initiatives to replaceradionuclide sources with lower energy X-ray sources. As researchers transition, questions remain regarding whether the biological effects of gamma-rays may berecapitulated with orthovoltage X-rays because different energies may inducedivergent biological effects. We therefore sought to compare the effects oforthovoltage X-rays with 1-mm Cu or Thoraeus filtration and 137Cs gamma-raysusing mouse models of acute radiation syndrome. Following whole-body irradiation,30-day overall survival was assessed, and the lethal dose to provoke 50%mortality within 30-days (LD50) was calculated by logistic regression. LD50 doseswere 6.7 Gy, 7.4 Gy, and 8.1 Gy with 1-mm Cu-filtered X-rays, Thoraeus-filteredX-rays, and 137Cs gamma-rays, respectively. Comparison of bone marrow, spleen,and intestinal tissue from mice irradiated with equivalent doses indicated thatinjury was most severe with 1-mm Cu-filtered X-rays, which resulted in thegreatest reduction in bone marrow cellularity, hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations, intestinal crypts, and OLFM4+ intestinal stem cells.Thoraeus-filtered X-rays provoked an intermediate phenotype, with 137Cs showingthe least damage. This study reveals a dichotomy between physical dose andbiological effect as researchers transition to orthovoltage X-rays. Withdecreasing energy, there is increasing hematopoietic and intestinal injury,necessitating dose reduction to achieve comparable biological effects.SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the significance of physical dose delivered usingenergetically different methods of radiation treatment will aid the transitionfrom radionuclide gamma-irradiators to orthovoltage X-irradiators.

AB  - The inability to detect early degenerative changes to the articular cartilagesurface that commonly precede bulk osteoarthritic degradation is an obstacle toearly disease detection for research or clinical diagnosis. Leveraging a knownartefact that blurs tissue boundaries in clinical arthrograms, contrast agent(CA) diffusivity can be derived from computed tomography arthrography (CTa)scans. We combined experimental and computational approaches to study protocolvariations that may alter the CTa-derived apparent diffusivity. In experimentalstudies on bovine cartilage explants, we examined how CA dilution and transportdirection (absorption versus desorption) influence the apparent diffusivity ofuntreated and enzymatically digested cartilage. Using multiphysics simulations,we examined mechanisms underlying experimental observations and the effects ofimage resolution, scan interval and early scan termination. The apparentdiffusivity during absorption decreased with increasing CA concentration by anamount similar to the increase induced by tissue digestion. Models indicated thatosmotically-induced fluid efflux strongly contributed to the concentrationeffect. Simulated changes to spatial resolution, scan spacing and total scan timeall influenced the apparent diffusivity, indicating the importance of consistent protocols. With careful control of imaging protocols and interpretations guidedby transport models, CTa-derived diffusivity offers promise as a biomarker forearly degenerative changes.

AB  - Hundreds of studies have found that weak magnetic fields can significantlyinfluence various biological systems. However, the underlying mechanisms behindthese phenomena remain elusive. Remarkably, the magnetic energies implicated inthese effects are much smaller than thermal energies. Here, we review theseobservations, and we suggest an explanation based on the radical pair mechanism, which involves the quantum dynamics of the electron and nuclear spins oftransient radical molecules. While the radical pair mechanism has been studied indetail in the context of avian magnetoreception, the studies reviewed here showthat magnetosensitivity is widespread throughout biology. We review magneticfield effects on various physiological functions, discussing static, hypomagneticand oscillating magnetic fields, as well as isotope effects. We then review theradical pair mechanism as a potential unifying model for the described magneticfield effects, and we discuss plausible candidate molecules for the radicalpairs. We review recent studies proposing that the radical pair mechanismprovides explanations for isotope effects in xenon anaesthesia and lithiumtreatment of hyperactivity, magnetic field effects on the circadian clock, andhypomagnetic field effects on neurogenesis and microtubule assembly. We conclude by discussing future lines of investigation in this exciting new area of quantum biology.

LID - 10.1098/rsif.2022.0321 [doi]
AB  - Ciliary motility disorders are known to cause hydrocephalus. The instantaneousvelocity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow is dominated by artery pulsation, and it remains unclear why ciliary dysfunction results in hydrocephalus. In thisstudy, we investigated the effects of cilia-induced surface velocity on CSF flow using computational fluid dynamics. A geometric model of the human ventricles wasconstructed using medical imaging data. The CSF produced by the choroid plexusand cilia-induced surface velocity were given as the velocity boundary conditionsat the ventricular walls. We developed healthy and reduced cilia motility models based on experimental data of cilia-induced velocity in healthy wild-type andDpcd-knockout mice. The results indicate that there is almost no difference inintraventricular pressure between healthy and reduced cilia motility models.Additionally, it was found that newly produced CSF from the choroid plexus didnot spread to the anterior and inferior horns of the lateral ventricles in thereduced cilia motility model. These findings suggest that a ciliary motilitydisorder could delay CSF exchange in the anterior and inferior horns of thelateral ventricles.

TI  - Population structure and genomic footprints of selection in five major Iranianhorse breeds.
LID - 10.1111/age.13243 [doi]
AB  - The genetic structure and characteristics of Iranian native breeds are yet to be comprehensibly investigated and studied. Therefore, we employed genomicinformation of 364 Iranian native horses representing the Asil (n = 109), Caspian(n = 40), Dareshuri (n = 44), Kurdish (n = 95), and Turkoman (n = 76) breeds toreveal the genetic structure and characteristics. For these and 19 other horsebreeds, principal component analysis, Bayesian model-based, Neighbor-Net, andbootstrap-based TreeMix approaches were applied to investigate and compare their genetic structure. Additionally, three haplotype-based methods includinghaplotype homozygosity pooled, integrated haplotype score, and number ofsegregating sites by length were applied to trace genomic footprints of selectionof Asil, Caspian, Dareshuri, Kurdish, and Turkoman groups. Then, the Mahalanobis distance based on the negative-log10 rank-based P-values was estimated based onthe haplotype homozygosity pooled, integrated haplotype score, and number ofsegregating sites by length values. Asil, Caspian, Dareshuri, Kurdish, andTurkoman can be categorized into five different genetic clusters. Based on thetop 1% of Mahalanobis distance based on the negative-log10 rank-based P-values ofSNPs, we identified 24 SNPs formerly reported to be associated with differenttraits and >100 genes undergoing selection pressures in Asil, Caspian, Dareshuri,Kurdish, and Turkoman. The detected QTL undergoing selection pressures wereassociated with withers height, equine metabolic syndrome, overall body size,insect bite hypersensitivity, guttural pouch tympany, white markings, Rhodococcusequi infection, jumping test score, alternate gaits, and body weight traits. Our findings will aid to have a better perspective of the genetic characteristics andpopulation structure of Asil, Caspian, Dareshuri, Kurdish, and Turkoman horses asIranian native horse breeds.

AB  - Lamb enteritis constitutes an economic burden on sheep production worldwide. Weaimed to estimate the prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)and Salmonellae among diarrheic lambs at Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Egypt and todetect the associated clinical, hematologic, biochemical, and antioxidantparameters. Fifty diarrheic and twenty apparently healthy control lambs wereexamined clinically, and hematologically. Diarrheic lambs had a significantelevated body temperature, respiratory and pulse rate, most of hemogrampara-meters, total proteins and albumin, oxidative stress markers malonaldiahyde and nitric oxide levels, liver enzymes, urea and creatinine than control group.On the other hand, these diarrheic lambs had significant reduction in totalleukocyte count and lymphocytes, antioxidant biomarkers super oxide dismutaseactivities and reduced glutathione than control lambs. E. coli and Salmonellaspp. were isolated from 32.00% and 16.00% of diseased lambs, respectively.Serotyping and biochemical tests of examined samples identified 16 E. coliisolates belonged to 10 different serotypes; O6, O8, O26:H11, O75, O84:H21,O103:H2, O114:H4, O121:H7, O128:H2 and O163:H2. All isolates are STEC as theyharbor either Shiga-toxin 1 or Shiga-toxin 2 genes or both. One isolate carriesintimin gene (eaeA) and classified as EHEC; O26:H11. The obtained nine isolatesof Salmonella carry enterotoxin (Stn) genes, eight of them carry hyper-invasivelocus (hilA) gene, all isolates belonged to six serotypes; S. Enteritidis, S.Heidelberg, S. Tsevie, S. Typhimurium, S. Essen, and S. Infantis. Lamb diarrheawas prevalent in the studied area and might constitute a veterinary and publichealth threat. Alteration in hemato-biochemical para-meters andoxidative-anti-oxidant balance could help adopt appropriate treatment regimens.

AB  - The study was designed to explore anatomical and histological vasculature changesin the female genital system of camel and serological aspects that might beresponsible to maintain thermoregulation. Twenty-four adult female camels weresampled during breeding (November-April) and non-breeding (May-October) season.Blood was collected for estrogen, progesterone and cortisol level estimation.Genital organs were sampled and described after slaughtering. Samples were taken from the ovarian artery (OA), vein (OV) and arterio-venous complex (AVC), forlight and scanning electron microscopy. Sections were stained with Hematoxylinand Eosin. (H&E), Masson's trichrome, Weigert's elastic and toluidine blue.Temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate stress indicator. Stressindicator was higher in non-breeding season (NBS). Anatomical and histologicalvasculature (OA, OV, AVC) dynamics were significantly higher in breeding season(BS) especially diameter of left OA. Parameters of OA were positively associated with estrogen level. Collagen, elastic, smooth muscles and mast cells wererecorded least in BS compared to NBS. Unique venous structure, intra-muralvenules (IMV), was discovered in tunica intima of OA, seen positively andnegatively associated with estrogen and cortisol level in BS, respectively.Scanned electron-micrograph exhibited penetration and wrapping of OA by smallthinned-walled venules that may form IMV. The AVC was too tightly packed todifferentiate due to the collapse of the wall. Hormonal, seasonal, stressindicator and vascular dynamic of female genital system are interlinked and IMVin association with OA and OV may be proposed as the site of counter-currentexchange in female reproductive system of the camel.

AB  - The aim of this study was to introduce a new animal model of fecal incontinence(FI) by injecting abobotulinumtoxinA in the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle of dogs which replaces models based on anal sphincter destructions that areinvasive, mostly require surgical procedures, expensive, permanent, and painfulto the animals. 4 healthy mongrel dogs were used in this study. First, they were received NaCl 0.09% (as control) injections in EAS muscle and effects wereassessed by means of Electromyography (EMG) and clinically evaluated by sphincterpinch test and presence of leakage of feces for 2 weeks. Then, they receivedabobotulinumtoxinA in EAS muscle and reevaluated for 6 weeks to see short-termand medium-term effects of abobotulinumtoxinA injection. Saline had nosignificant changes in results obtained from EMG, however, there were significantdecreases in amplitudes of action potentials after receiving abobotulinumtoxinAin comparison with no injection or saline injection in EAS muscle. Pinch testswere normal after saline injection assessment period, however, then started to benegative, ranging from two days after abobotulinumtoxinA injection to seven days after receiving abobotulinumtoxinA. Animals also had significant presentations offecal incontinence (leakage of feces and cage contamination with feces) from the 1(st) week after receiving abobotulinumtoxinA until the 6(th) week afterreceiving abobotulinumtoxinA. AbobotulinumtoxinA caused paralysis in the EAS and producd FI conditions in dogs. This animal model was an appropriate substitute tothe various invasive, expensive and also complicated procedures with an easy,feasible, noninvasive and non-painful single-stage abobotulinumtoxinA injection.

AB  - Cyclophosphamide leaves an undesirable effect on testes. This study was conductedto explore the effects of the Phoenix dactylifera (DP) on testes following thecyclophosphamide treatment. Thirty-six male mice were divided into six groups,one control, one cyclophosphamide, two groups of cyclophosphamide with a dose of 200 mg kg(-1) and a dose of 400 mg kg(-1) DP, and two of only high and low doses of DP. All groups were gavaged daily for 28 days. The animals were euthanized 24 hr after implementing the last treatment. Then, the testes and epididymis sampleswere removed and weighed. The main sperm characteristics such as the number ofsperm and sperm viability, the morphometric changes, biochemical analysis oftestes and enzyme activity were investigated. With the cyclophosphamide group,only body weight, testes weight, epididymis weight, sperm viability and thefertilization percentage were decreased significantly compared to the controlgroup. Moreover, the spermatogenesis indices and morphometric parameters in this group indicated a significant decrease. Furthermore, the morphological changeswere observed in the testicular tissue, including seminiferous tubule atrophy,vacuolation, hyperemia of blood vessels and increased space in the interstitialtissue. In the biochemical study of cyclophosphamide group, the amount ofglutathione peroxidase in serum was decreased, whereas, the amount ofmalondialdehyde in testicular tissue showed a significant increase. The DP group included the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. It seemed that thecompounds in the DP would lead to the inhibition of the production of activemetabolites released from the cyclophosphamide.

TI  - Catechin-7-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside can reduce alpha-MSH-induced melanogenesis in B16F10 melanoma cells through competitive inhibition of tyrosinase.
PG  - 1131-1137
LID - 10.7150/ijms.72241 [doi]
AB  - Although melanogenesis is a defense mechanism against ultraviolet (UV)-inducedskin damage, abnormally excessive melanin production causes pigmentationdisorders. Tyrosinase, as a key factor for melanin synthesis, plays an important role in inducing skin pigmentation. Therefore, the inhibition of tyrosinase iscrucial in preventing skin pigmentation in the cosmetics and medicine fields.However, the majority of well-known tyrosinase inhibitors have been discontinued due to toxic effects on the skin or lack of selectivity and/or stability. In thisstudy, we evaluated possible anti-melanogenic effects ofcatechin-7-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (C7R) isolated from the stem bark of Ulmus parvifolia, to discover a new tyrosinase inhibitor that has both safety andstability. When C7R was pretreated in B16F10 melanoma cells stimulated byalpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, this compound reduced melanin accumulation and murine tyrosinase activity. In line with these results, C7R inhibitstyrosinase purified from a mushroom in vitro like kojic acid and arbutin.Furthermore, C7R exhibited a competitive inhibition on a Lineweaver-Burk plot.Next, the underlying mechanisms of the C7R-mediated tyrosinase inhibitory effect were sought through docking simulation and pharmacophore analysis betweentyrosinase residues and C7R. The results of these analyses showed that C7R hadbinding energy of -14.5kcal/mol, and indicated that C7R interacts with tyrosinasethrough an aromatic ring and various hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds. Together,our results suggest that C7R can be applied as a novel natural anti-melanogenicagent that inhibits tyrosinase.

LID - 10.7150/ijms.72646 [doi]
AB  - Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), protein-bound uremic toxins, caninduce oxidative stress and cause renal disease progression. However, thedifferent cytotoxic effects on renal cells between IS and PCS are not stated. Dueto uremic toxins are generally found in CKD patients, the mechanisms of uremictoxins-induced renal injury are required to study. Curcumin has anti-oxidant,anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects which may be potential used toprotect against renal damage. In contrast, curcumin also exert cytotoxic effects on various cells. In addition, curcumin may reduce or enhance cytotoxicitycombined with different chemicals treatments. However, whether curcumin mayinfluence uremic toxins-induced renal injury is unclear. The goal of this studyis to compare the different cytotoxic effects on renal cells between IS and PCStreatment, as well as the synergistic or antagonistic effects by combinationtreatments with curcumin and PCS. Our experimental result shows the PCS exerts a stronger antiproliferative effect on renal tubular cells than IS treatment. Inaddition, our study firstly demonstrates that curcumin enhances PCS-induced cell cytotoxicity through caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and cell cyclealteration.

TI  - Rotenone, an environmental toxin, causes abnormal methylation of the mouse brain organoid's genome and ferroptosis.
PG  - 1184-1197
LID - 10.7150/ijms.74569 [doi]
AB  - More and more reports have pointed out that rotenone, as an insecticide, has highneurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity to livestock and mammals. As a highlyphysiological correlation system of internal organs, quasi-organs have greatpotential in the fields of drug toxicity and efficacy test, toxicology research, developmental biology and so on. In this study, brain organs (mBOs) derived from mouse neural stem cells were used to investigate the effects of rotenone on thephysiological activity and epigenetic modification of mBOs. At the same time,Rotenone could significantly stimulate the increase of the concentration of LPO, lactic acid and hydroxyl radical in mBOs, and inhibit the expression of neuronal marker Tuj1, CHAT, PAX6 and so on. Further analysis showed that Rotenonem couldinduce mitochondrial damage in mBOs. The results of qPCR and Western blot showed that Rotenone could up-regulate the expressions of ferroptosis promoting protein p53, Cox2 and so on, while inhibit the expressions of negative regulatory proteinof ferroptosis GPX4, FTH1, SLC7A11. In addition, the results of RRBS-Seqsequencing showed that the methylation modification at DMR level inRotenone-treated mBOs group was significantly higher than that in Ctrl group. Theresults of KEGG analysis showed that compared with Ctrl, the genes withhypermethylation of promoter and Genebody in Rotenone-treated mBOs were mainlylocated in the Neuro active ligand-receptor interaction signal transductionpathway. In summary, rotenone can significantly lead to abnormal methylation ofmouse brain organs, and lead to the loss of normal physiological function ofneurons by inducing ferroptosis.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability. Ischemiatriggers a cascade of events leading to cell death and cerebral infarction.Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a promising treatment modality to promote the development of nerve and blood vessels and improve nerve function. However,MSCs have a limited therapeutic effect in the harsh microenvironment of ischemic brain tissue. Modified MSC therapy shows better therapeutic effect underdifferent pathological conditions, and is expected to be translated into clinicalpractice. In this article, we review the latest advances in the development ofmodified MSCs for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. In particular, we summarizethe targets involved in migration, homing, antioxidant stress, anti-inflammatory,nerve and vascular regeneration, providing new ideas for clinical transformation.

AB  - Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives andProducts or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver ascientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of the feed additive consisting of l-arginine produced by fermentation using a non-genetically modified strain ofCorynebacterium glutamicum (CGMCC 20516). The additive is intended to be used in feed and water for drinking for all animal species and categories. The productionstrain was considered suitable for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS)approach to safety assessment. No viable cells of C. glutamicum CGMCC 20516 were detected in the final product. l-Arginine produced using C. glutamicum CGMCC20516 is safe for the target species when supplemented in appropriate amounts to the diet according to the nutritional needs of the target species, for theconsumer and for the environment. In the absence of data, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the safety of l-arginine produced by C. glutamicum CGMCC 20516for the users. The additive l-arginine produced by fermentation using C.glutamicum CGMCC 20516 is regarded as an efficacious source of the essentialamino acid l-arginine for non-ruminant species. For the supplemental l-arginineto be as efficacious in ruminants as in non-ruminant species, it requiresprotection against degradation in the rumen.

TI  - Oral tolerance as antigen-specific immunotherapy.
PG  - ltab017
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab017 [doi]
AB  - Oral tolerance is a physiological phenomenon described more than a century ago asa suppressive immune response to antigens that gain access to the body by theoral route. It is a robust and long-lasting event with local and systemic effectsin which the generation of mucosally induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) plays an essential role. The idea of using oral tolerance to inhibit autoimmune andallergic diseases by oral administration of target antigens was an importantdevelopment that was successfully tested in 1980s. Since then, several studieshave shown that feeding specific antigens can be used to prevent and controlchronic inflammatory diseases in both animal models and clinically. Therefore,oral tolerance can be classified as an antigen-specific form of oralimmunotherapy (OIT). In the light of novel findings on mechanisms, sites ofinduction and factors affecting oral tolerance, this review will focus onspecific characteristics of oral tolerance induction and how they impact in itstherapeutic application.

TI  - Beef Quality Assurance national rancher survey: program participation, bestmanagement practices, and motivations for joining future sustainability programs.
PG  - txac094
LID - 10.1093/tas/txac094 [doi]
AB  - Till date, with over 137,000 certified members, the most successful ranchereducational program has been the Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) program. The BQAprogram was established in the mid-1990's to improve animal health and welfarewith a primary objective to reduce the incidence of injection site lesions byinstructing producers to administer injections in the neck only. The presentstudy investigated the drivers of this success to inform future rancher educationprograms around agricultural sustainability. An online multistate survey wasadministered to cattle ranchers in collaboration with state cattlemen'sassociations to better understand rancher motivations for adopting new practices and to gain insight on current involvement in BQA. In total, the survey consistedof 45 questions and was divided into 3 sections: (1) rancher demographics, (2)BQA participation and current best management practice (BMP) application, and (3)willingness to join new rancher educational programs. Data from 842 respondentsare including in this study. Of the survey participants, 70% were currently BQAcertified or had been BQA certified at one time, and 30% had never beencertified. Ranchers who were BQA certified at any time were less likely toadminister injections in areas other than the neck compared to ranchers who were not certified (P < 0.05), demonstrating the effectiveness of the BQA program.More than 80% of survey respondents who joined the BQA program stated theybelieved the BQA program improved animal health and welfare on their operation (n= 617). Among those who had not joined the BQA program, 40% believed BQApractices did not align with their ranching operation, while 38% had not heard ofthe BQA program (n = 256). The survey indicated that male ranchers, those withmore years ranching, those with a larger percent of income coming from ranching, and ranches with larger total acres grazed were more likely to be BQA certifiedat any time (P < 0.05). Finally, ranchers who were BQA certified at any time weremore likely to state that joining a rancher sustainability program would bebeneficial to their operation. In conclusion, not only did the survey providevaluable insight into BQA program adoption but highlighted how BQA pedagogy andprogram structure may be a suitable framework for creating future ranchersustainability programs.

AB  - The objectives of this trial were to evaluate the association between differentlevels of dry matter intake (DMI) on gas exchange, plasma glucose-dependentinsulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) concentration, and intramuscular (IM) fatdeposition. We used 60 individually fed backgrounded Angus x SimAngus-crossbredsteers (n = 30) in a randomized complete block design. Steers (paired by bodyweight [BW] and gain to feed ratio [G:F]) were randomly allocated to one of thefollowing treatments: ad libitum intake (AI) or restricted intake (RI; the samediet fed at 85% of the AI) of a finishing diet. The diet contained 61% crackedcorn, 9% corn silage, 15% distillers' dried grains with solubles, 5% soyhulls,and 10% of a protein-mineral-vitamin premix. Measurements of CO2 emission andconsumption of O2, and respiratory quotient (RQ) were taken using the GreenFeedsystem (n = 15/treatment). Plasma and gas samples were collected 10 d beforeslaughter, 1 h before and 2 h after feeding. Plasma glucose, non-esterified fattyacids, GIP, and insulin concentration and gasses (O2, CO2, and RQ) were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS evaluating the fixed effect of treatment, time(repeated measurement) and their interaction, and the random effect of the block.Final BW and carcass characteristics were analyzed with a similar model, without the time statement and its interaction. Compared with RI, AI steers had greater(P < 0.01) DMI and average daily gain (ADG). Steers on AI had greater final BW (P= 0.02), tended to have a greater ribeye area (P = 0.09), and had lower plasmaGIP concentration (P = 0.04). There was no treatment effect (P >/= 0.11) on G:F, subcutaneous backfat (BF), and IM fat, O2 consumption, CO2 emission, and RQ.Plasma glucose concentration of AI steers was greater before and after feedingthan RI (P < 0.05). In conclusion, feeding steers ad libitum increased DMI, ADG, and plasma glucose and GIP concentration but does not affect G:F, BF, IM fat, CO2emission, and O2 consumption. Plasma GIP concentration and RQ are not associated with IM fat deposition.

AB  - A healthy diet and dietary supplements have gained attention as potentialco-adjuvants in managing and preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thispaper critically reviews the current evidence regarding the impact of diet andsupplements on the prevention and progression of COVID-19. According to availabledata, a healthy diet and normal weight are considered protective factors.Regarding dietary supplementation, the most robust results from human studies arefor vitamin C, which appears to decrease inflammatory markers and suppresscytokine storm. A small, randomized trial showed that a high dose of vitamin Dsignificantly reduced the need for intensive care unit treatment of patientsrequiring hospitalization for COVID-19. According to retrospective human studies,there is limited evidence for vitamin E and selenium supplements. Animal studies have investigated the effects of green tea and curcumin. Xanthohumol andprobiotics, interesting for their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, andimmunoregulatory properties, need formal clinical study. In summary, there ispromising evidence supporting the role of diet and supplements as co-adjuvants inthe treatment of COVID-19. Further studies and properly designed clinical trials are necessary to draw more robust conclusions; however, it is not unreasonable totake a pragmatic approach and promote the use of appropriate diet and supplementsto counter the effects of COVID-19, ideally with a mechanism to assess outcomes.

LID - 10.3746/pnf.2022.27.2.212 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the antioxidant chemical constituents (total phenolic andtotal flavonoid contents) and antioxidant activities[1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radicalscavenging, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] of different solventextracts of eighteen functional plants. The active components of the targetplants were extracted using four different solvents (methanol, ethanol,chloroform, and water). Mentha piperascens leaf exhibited a higher total phenoliccontent (chloroform and water extracts), total flavonoid content (all solventextracts), DPPH radical scavenging activity (methanol, ethanol, and waterextracts), ABTS radical scavenging activity (water extract), and FRAP radicalscavenging activity (water extract) (in all solvent extracts). Similarly,Petasites japonicas root was another excellent and competent extract with a high total flavonoid content (in all four solvent extracts), DPPH and ABTS radicalscavenging activity (methanol, ethanol, and water extracts), and FRAP activity(methanol, ethanol, and water extracts) (in all solvent extracts). Rubus coreanusfruit had the highest total phenolic content (methanol, ethanol, and waterextracts), DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activate (in all solvent extracts),and FRAP in its water extract were the two most effective functional plants.Based on the abundance of antioxidant chemical constituents and the most potentantioxidant activity demonstrated in this study, extracts from M. piperascensleaf, P. japonicas root, and R. coreanus fruit appear to be promising candidates to meet the current demand for natural preservatives in food and pharmaceuticalindustries.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus casei HY2782 andPueraria lobata root extract complex (HY2782 complex) in mitigating airwayinflammation resulting from exposure to particulate matter </=2.5 mum in diameter(PM2.5) in an animal model. Chronic inflammatory airway disease is associatedwith Th2-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and Th17-relatedcytokine IL-17A, which are the major contributors to allergy and asthma. Results indicated that PM2.5 elevates allergen-related airway inflammation andrespiratory hyperresponsiveness in C57BL/6 mice. The HY2782 complex significantlyreduced Th2/Th17-derived cytokines IL-4, IL5, IL-13, and IL-17A; immunoglobulinE; and leukotriene C4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum.Furthermore, the HY2782 complex was associated with the modulation of oxidativestress-related genes. Administration of the HY2782 complex resulted in a markedlyreduced number of neutrophils and eosinophil infiltration in BALF.Histopathological observation of lung tissue also showed reduced inflammatorycell infiltration into airways and surrounding tissue. The HY2782 complex may be a promising candidate for the preventive therapy of allergic diseases and airway inflammation caused by PM2.5 inhalation.

PG  - 1183-1190
LID - 10.34067/KID.0000322022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Sulfur is an important mineral element whose principal source isanimal protein. Animal protein contributes to the daily acid load, which isassociated with poor outcomes in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD).We hypothesized that higher urinary sulfate, as a reflection of the daily acidload, is associated with a greater risk of death and CKD progression. Methods:Urinary sulfate was measured in 1057 African American Study of Kidney Disease andHypertension (AASK) participants at baseline. Participants were categorized bytertiles of daily sulfate excretion. The longitudinal outcome of interest was thecomposite of death, dialysis, or 50% reduction in measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Multivariable adjusted Cox regression models were fit to relate thecomposite outcome to daily sulfate excretion using the lowest tertile as thereference. Results: Participants in the highest urinary sulfate tertile were morelikely to be men and have a higher body mass index, protein intake, measured GFR,and urinary ammonium and phosphate excretion, and lower urinaryprotein/creatinine. Compared with those in the lowest tertile of sulfate, thosein the highest tertile had a 44% lower hazard (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.84), and thosein the middle tertile had a 27% lower hazard (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.96) of death,dialysis, or 50% reduction in measured GFR during follow-up after adjusting fordemographics, GFR, protein intake, and other potential confounders. Proteinintake was not associated with risk of these events. Conclusions: Higher urinary sulfate excretion is associated with more favorable outcomes in Blacks who haveCKD attributed to hypertension.

LID - 10.34067/KID.0001032022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Despite widespread use of renin-aldosterone-angiotensin systeminhibitors and the benefits of lowering glomerular pressure in patients with CKD,there remains a major unmet need for therapies targeting underlying causes of CKDprogression. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) promotes apoptosis andglomerulosclerosis, and is implicated in the progression of diabetic kidneydisease (DKD), a major cause of CKD. Selonsertib is a selective ASK1 inhibitorcurrently in clinical development for the treatment of DKD. We examined the addedbenefits of selonsertib on existing glomerulosclerosis and related molecularpathways in the nondiabetic 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) rat model in combinationwith the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats underwent 5/6 Nx with kidney biopsy 8 weeks later forassessment of glomerulosclerosis, and were randomized to four treatment groupswith equal glomerulosclerosis: selonsertib, enalapril, combination (selonsertibplus enalapril), and untreated controls. Serum creatinine, systolic BP (SBP), andurinary albumin were measured at intervals. Animals were euthanized at week 12for histologic, biochemical, and molecular analyses. Results: All rats developed hypertension, albuminuria, and glomerulosclerosis by week 8. Kidney functionfurther declined, and glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria progressively increased in controls from week 8 to 12. Enalapril treatment alone from week 8 to 12reduced SBP versus controls, decreased albuminuria, and resulted in numericallylower glomerulosclerosis. Selonsertib alone had no effect on SBP but preservedkidney function. Combined treatment significantly reduced glomerulosclerosis,with more regression than either monotherapy. Enalapril treatment resulted infewer interstitial macrophages, whereas selonsertib treatment reduced apoptosisand podocyte loss. RNA-seq revealed that combined treatment influenced pathwaysrelated to extracellular matrix and wound healing. Conclusions: Selonsertibtargets a novel, nonhemodynamic pathway in CKD. Our data suggest that ASK1inhibition, when combined with ACEI, has additive effects to reduce progressionof glomerulosclerosis, attenuate kidney function decline, and reduce podocyteloss.

AB  - Background: Kidney formation requires coordinated interactions between multiplecell types. Input from the interstitial progenitor cells is implicated inmultiple aspects of kidney development. We previously reported that transcriptionfactor 21 (Tcf21) is required for ureteric bud branching. Here, we show thatTcf21 in Foxd1+ interstitial progenitors regulates stromal formation anddifferentiation via interaction with beta-catenin. Methods: We utilized theFoxd1Cre;Tcf21(f/f) murine kidney for morphologic analysis. We used the murineclonal mesenchymal cell lines MK3/M15 to study Tcf21 interaction withWnt/beta-catenin. Results: Absence of Tcf21 from Foxd1+ stromal progenitorscaused a decrease in stromal cell proliferation, leading to marked reduction ofthe medullary stromal space. Lack of Tcf21 in the Foxd1+ stromal cells also ledto defective differentiation of interstitial cells to smooth-muscle cells,perivascular pericytes, and mesangial cells. Foxd1Cre;Tcf21(f/f) kidney showed anabnormal pattern of the renal vascular tree. The stroma of Foxd1Cre;Tcf21(f/f)kidney demonstrated marked reduction in beta-catenin protein expression compared with wild type. Tcf21 was bound to beta-catenin both upon beta-cateninstabilization and at basal state as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation in vitro.In MK3/M15 metanephric mesenchymal cells, Tcf21 enhanced TCF/LEF promoteractivity upon beta-catenin stabilization, whereas DNA-binding deficient mutatedTcf21 did not enhance TCF/LEF promoter activity. Kidney explants ofFoxd1Cre;Tcf21(f/f) showed low mRNA expression of stromal Wnt target genes.Treatment of the explants with CHIR, a Wnt ligand mimetic, restored Wnt targetgene expression. Here, we also corroborated previous evidence that normaldevelopment of the kidney stroma is required for normal development of the Six2+ nephron progenitor cells, loop of Henle, and the collecting ducts. Conclusions:These findings suggest that stromal Tcf21 facilitates medullary stromadevelopment by enhancing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and promotes stromal cellproliferation and differentiation. Stromal Tcf21 is also required for thedevelopment of the adjacent nephron epithelia.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect and mechanism of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)in mice with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: Firstly, a CHD model of mousewas established by feeding mice high-fat diet and randomly divided into fourgroups, including Model group (0.5% sodium cholate) and 10 mg/kg EGCG, 20 mg/kgEGCG, and 40 mg/kg EGCG groups. After oral administration of sodium cholate orEGCG, HE staining was conducted to assess the pathological changes of mousecardiac tissues in each group of mice, biochemical kits to measure the levels of blood lipid and oxidative stress substance activity, and western blot to detectmatrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA),as well as expression levels of protein related to Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 pathway incardiac tissues. Results: The mice in the CHD model appeared to have myocardialpathological damage with elevated serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride(TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Of note, administration of EGCG significantlyattenuated myocardial injuries and improved blood lipid levels in mice in aconcentration-dependent manner. The advent of EGCG significantly decreased theexpression of VEGFA and MMP-2 and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), when reducing the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in themyocardial tissue and upregulating the expression of HO-1, NQO1, and Nrf2.Conclusion: EGCG may reduce atherosclerotic plaque and alleviate pathologicaldamage in the cardiac tissue of CHD mice as well as improve blood lipid levelswith antioxidative effect. The mechanism of its effect may be related to theactivation of the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 antioxidant pathway in vivo of the CHD mice.

TI  - Cervical tracheal rupture with persistence of a pseudotrachea in a dog.
PG  - 830-834
AB  - A dog was examined because of acute onset of respiratory distress following acervical dog bite. Physical examination revealed a deep ventral cervical bitewound associated with localized mild subcutaneous emphysema. Thoracic radiographsshowed moderate pneumomediastinum. Medical management consisting of oxygentherapy, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories was initiated. After 2 days,respiratory distress suddenly worsened. Tracheoscopy showed a discontinuitybetween the tracheal rings of the cervical trachea; however, the inner trachealwall appeared intact. Computed tomography scan revealed a ~3-cm complete rupture of all layers of the trachea. Surgical resection and anastomosis of the tracheawere performed successfully. Follow-up 15 days after surgery showed completeresolution of respiratory signs, as well as subcutaneous emphysema. A mildventral angulation of the trachea at the surgical site was noticed on thoracicradiographs. This is the first case report of a pseudotrachea in a dog.Persistence of a pseudotrachea may initially result in only minor clinical signs responsive to medical therapy despite tracheal rupture. In the presence of apseudotrachea, tracheal rupture may be difficult to identify with tracheoscopyalone. Therefore, CT scan should be proposed in every patient with suspectedtracheal trauma. Key clinical message: This case report highlights the importanceof including a tracheal rupture in the differential diagnosis of cervicalsubcutaneous emphysema, even if the amount is small and not associated withsignificant respiratory signs. The presence of a pseudotrachea may result in lesssevere clinical signs than expected based on the actual degree of trachealinjury; however, the clinical status may rapidly deteriorate and becomelife-threatening. This case report also underlines the importance of a CT scan asa complement to tracheoscopy, which may not be sufficient to identify a tracheal rupture in the presence of a pseudotrachea.

TI  - Glossitis in an older non-corgi dog: Diagnosis and long-term follow-up.
PG  - 825-829
AB  - A 9-year-old spayed female 18.8 kg mixed breed boxer dog was referred forevaluation of a 7-month history of difficulty swallowing and prehending food,regurgitation, hypersalivation, and an abnormal dorsiflexion of the tongue. Priorto referral, a barium study was performed, which revealed a mildly dilatedesophagus. Treatment with sucralfate, cisapride, and prednisone was initiated.Physical examination revealed bilateral, symmetric atrophy of the temporalismuscles, dorsiflexion of the distal aspect of the tongue with concurrent muscleatrophy, and a reduced gag reflex. Electrodiagnostic examinations revealedspontaneous electrical activity in the muscles of mastication and tongue.Biopsies from the right temporalis, tongue, and biceps femoris muscles werecollected. An immune-mediated myositis with fibrosis, scattered CD3, CD4, andCD8+ T-lymphocytes, and upregulation of markers for major histocompatibilityantigens were observed in the tongue and temporalis muscles. The dog was treated with a tapering course of prednisone over 2 months and cyclosporine long-term.The dog was maintained on cyclosporine alone for > 2 years and clinical signsremained static, although multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia occurred.Ultimately, euthanasia was performed due to chronic kidney disease withassociated anemia, lethargy, and anorexia.

AB  - A 1-year-old male golden retriever-poodle crossbred dog was brought to aveterinary clinic with a 1-month travel history to Muskoka, Ontario and a 1-week history of left eye irritation and ocular discharge. Ophthalmic examination andblood analysis revealed bilateral uveitis with a normal complete blood (cell)count and biochemistry panel. Symptomatic treatment was administered with noimprovement observed and the dog returned 2 weeks later for assessment of adraining swelling of the left hind 4th digit. Clinical examination of thoracicradiographs and abdominal ultrasound showed evidence of disseminatedblastomycosis characterized by pulmonary lesions, and multifocal lymphadenopathy.Biopsy of the draining lesion and cytological examination of an enlarged lymphnode established diagnosis. The dog was started on a standard antifungaltreatment protocol (itraconazole) but returned after 11 d of treatment withneurological signs including ataxia, paraparesis, left head tilt, and compulsive turning. Humane euthanasia was chosen and the diagnosis was confirmed atpostmortem examination.

TI  - Gastroesophageal intussusception in a 4-week-old German shepherd puppy.
PG  - 841-844
AB  - The surgical treatment of a gastroesophageal intussusception (GEI) in a4-week-old male intact German shepherd puppy is described in this report.Bilateral gastropexies were performed; an incisional gastropexy on the right and a gastrostomy tube gastropexy on the left. The dog recovered well and is thrivinglong-term with no clinical signs of persistent megaesophagus. With thecombination of early detection and surgical correction of GEI, mortality ratesmay be lower than the 95% mortality rate that has been reported in previousliterature and supports new studies that have reported a 65% survival ratelong-term. Key clinical message: Young animals presenting with vague clinicalsigns require thorough evaluation to identify uncommon, yet life-threateningdiseases such as GEI. Early detection and interventions can subsequently lead to successful outcomes.
